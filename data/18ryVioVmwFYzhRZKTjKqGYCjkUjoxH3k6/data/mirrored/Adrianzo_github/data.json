Maybe you could rewrite the first post explaining it clearly.\n\nHaving an interface that crosstalks clearnet and zeronet could be the take off in fighting censorship. And a browser add-on might just be that interface. But why do I feel that this could be the take off? It's just in terms of user-friendliness. And I believe zeronet its quite friendly, specially for windows _**lusers**_ since they have all bundled up. So, this take-off we are talking might not rely only on user-friendliness (since its already provided)... This is kind of 'debatable'.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I believe your idea is a good one. I'm just saying that zeronet at its current state already fights censorship in an user-friendly manner. And I believe the main developer it's working in providing new features to it, instead of making 'candy' to attract more users. I hope you understand my point, I'm having some difficulty in pointing it out.\n\nLet me put an example, we could achieve something similar to your idea with some script that pulls RSS feeds from newspapers and creates threads in a zerotalk clone zite. In fact, merger sites and the hubs of zero-me will provide this, for sure. This is the kind of developing that zeronet focuses on.\n\nOf course, I'm just a regular user giving an opinion and if it were up to me, of course the browser addon should be implemented just as one more tool. It's just that it doesn't feel like a priority (to me).\n", "added": 1469114444, "modified": 1469114595, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/510#issuecomment-234339507", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065379_mirrored_Adrianzo_github": [{"comment_id": 7, "body": "Can we have a word on this?... it seems that only commented issues get replied :/\n", "added": 1470771974, "modified": 1470771974, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/512#issuecomment-238715607", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065382_mirrored_tonyassassin_github": [{"comment_id": 8, "body": "1.
