The per service overhead should be as small as possibly, so \nthat the overwhelming factor is only the actual data being transferred, \nwhich in both cases is the same.\nThen it would also not matter if you use a total of 6 hops or 300 or \n1200 hops (200 sites \\* 3 hops \\* 2 directions), because all the 1200 hops \nwould consume only little more than the 6 hops would do if the same \nsites were visited/served through them. Like if a user share X kB/s, it \nshould not matter if he routes two tunnels with X/2 kB/s each, or 100 \ntunnels with X/100, also amounting to exactly the same ressource usage.\nOnly floodfills would have more work.\n\nI have the impression, thugh, that i2p in that respect is much more \nressource hungry and needs significant traffic overhead per-tunnel. Is \nthe reason bhind that, that i2p is more decentralized than tor or that \ntunnels are more short-lived? Is there anything that could be done to \nreduce? - apart from tunnel management that reduces the per-dest tunnel \ncount to one, which would still be a huge amount if you are serving 200 \nsite only with zeronet and are still having other aplications use i2p \ntoo (torrent, \u2026)\n", "added": 1469450873, "modified": 1469450873, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/45#issuecomment-234993922", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 8, "body": "Any progress here?\n", "added": 1475457982, "modified": 1475457982, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/45#issuecomment-251024506", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 9, "body": "Thank you for your work! \nHopefully, someone can fix i2p.socket\n", "added": 1476208137, "modified": 1476208137, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/45#issuecomment-253041420", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 10, "body": "Any news here? what's the status of this, now that i2p.socket was patched?", "added": 1488555365, "modified": 1488555365, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/45#issuecomment-284034056", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 11, "body": "In my experience this was an issue with i2p.
