So, how can you use DHT in a way that preserves these basic requirements, while not necessarily using Tor and not impeding the ability to use Tor for the rest of ZeroNet's functions?  \r\n\r\nSo, when I look at [OpenDHT](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht), I wonder to what extent this capability helps meet these core requirements:\r\n\r\n> Public key cryptography layer providing optional data signature and encryption (using GnuTLS)\r\n  ", "added": 1565617987, "modified": 1565618252, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/57#issuecomment-520505702", "source_type": "github"}], "1604067436_mirrored_filips123_github": [{"comment_id": 2, "body": "Could roll this into a higher level requirement for centralized configuration, or more generally, a hash table where the keys are delimited text, and the values are ZN objects (for images) or text (username, etc,...).  \r\n\r\nE.g., key: \"/users/{user id}/profile/avatar\", value: \"{znId}\"\r\n\r\nThe tough part is how to distribute it.

I don't know enough about DHTs being used in P2P to know if they complete this requirement in a way where it fits this use with ZeroNet.  If they are a fit, and DHT is currently a feature request, then this issue could become dependent on DHT being integrated.
