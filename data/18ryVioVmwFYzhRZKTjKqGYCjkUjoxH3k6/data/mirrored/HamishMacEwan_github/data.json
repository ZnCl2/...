These are the xn-- strings appearing from the OP.\n\nIt's completely possible for ZeroNet (and possibly the plug-in) to recognise non-ASCII, punycode it and look it up in Namecoin's register blockchain.  It is not necessary to register the Unicode directly in Namecoin, and the OP hasn't.\n\nSome xn-- names are working, http://127.0.0.1:43110/xn--tqh.bit for example AKA \u2442.bit (http://namecha.in/name/d/xn--tqh)\n", "added": 1456973132, "modified": 1456973132, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/131#issuecomment-191592900", "source_type": "github"}], "1604065106_mirrored_HamishMacEwan_github": [{"comment_id": 2, "body": "That is a poor excuse.\n\nIf ZeroNet is to serve a global audience it will need to do better than Morse code in terms of character set.\n\nThey are not hard to type by people who use them, and there are sufficient phishing opportunities in 1l O0 etc and indeed people don't even need similarity to be fooled.\n\nYou might also like to consider how squatted NMC names are, opening up the full Unicode space may well defeat that.\n\nTo complain about phishing and unicode while exploiting torrent and bitcoin protocols and their attendant criminality is lame.\n\nIf the goal of ZeroNet was to give users choice, to deny implementation of a service NMC already offers is contrary to that ethos and disappointing in the extreme.\n", "added": 1457318301, "modified": 1457318301, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/298#issuecomment-193113146", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 3, "body": "I'm sure you can distinguish xn--n1aeb.bit from cop.bit, and since ZeroNet doesn't display the unicode version on http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Name2NXVi1RDPDgf5617UoW7xA6YrhM9F there isn't much opportunity.\n\nGiven the much easier and effective phishing attacks, taking a position of protection against this kind of esoteric quirk is patronising.
