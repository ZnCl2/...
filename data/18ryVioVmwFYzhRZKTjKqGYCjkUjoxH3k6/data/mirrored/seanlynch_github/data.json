That latter part is really optional since there probably aren't any browsers that work with ZeroNet that don't support gzip.\n", "added": 1463166141, "modified": 1463166141, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/98#issuecomment-219170239", "source_type": "github"}, {"comment_id": 2, "body": "Why not use a direct access archive format like ZIP instead of one that requires you to unpack the entire archive before accessing any files? It might even be possible to generate a header and send an individual file directly to the browser without compressing it since ZIP and gzip use compatible compression algorithms, though I'm not sure if any of the libraries support this out of the box.
