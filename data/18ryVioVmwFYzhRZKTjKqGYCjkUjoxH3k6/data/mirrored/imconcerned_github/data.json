Can there be a way to make a separate content.json for directories, so that they aren't loaded with the rest of the site, and have separate seeders, etc? I could create a site for each video or couple of videos, and serve links on the main site, but a directory system would be a much better design.\n", "parent_topic_uri": "1604062980_users_1Cy3ntkN2GN9MH6EaW6eHpi4YoRS2nK5Di", "added": 1441494448, "modified": 1452445820, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/144", "source_type": "github"}, {"topic_id": 1604064910, "title": "(feature request) Internal torrent client for external torrent files", "body": "If there was an internal torrent client, people could make links or source references (`<img>`, `<video>`) to torrent files on the site (e.g. a video, zip file, etc), clicking the links would start seeding the file and streaming the gathered pieces to the browser, and a torrent manager could be another internal page.
