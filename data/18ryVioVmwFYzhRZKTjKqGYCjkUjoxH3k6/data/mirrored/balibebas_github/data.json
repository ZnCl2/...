I see there are a couple of plugins but it's not clear which one will give me `zero://` scheme redirects out of the box. Regardless of whether or not it's _the correct way_ I feel using `zero://` is the best option because it's easy to remember, easy to type and leaves room for the underlying protocol to change over time. IIRC this part of the URI is actually called a _scheme_ not a protocol in case that helps remove some of the \"stink\" I saw referenced elsewhere. The rest is an implementation detail and should be greenfield not standard.\r\n\r\nOn growing the userbase... sell people the idea of `.bit` domains for sale like it's the beginning of the WWW all over. Appending anything to `.bit` ruins the sexiness of obtaining 3 and 4 letter domain names.", "added": 1593603685, "modified": 1593603685, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2100#issuecomment-652459998", "source_type": "github"}]}}
