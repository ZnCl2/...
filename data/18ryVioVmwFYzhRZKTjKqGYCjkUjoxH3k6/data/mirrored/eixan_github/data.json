I went into the settings and found that the toggle to launch a browser was wisely toggled off. So I tried to toggle it on again in hopes that when it restarts after I toggle it off it will respect that setting. It didn't even start. Aside from this the program often just doesn't start sometimes.\r\n#### Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n  1. _____\r\n  2. _____\r\n  3. _____\r\n\r\n#### Observed Results:\r\n\r\n  * What happened?
