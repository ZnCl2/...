ZN IS  DYING OUT of CHINA\r\ntalk is cheaper ,i want to be a contributor if I can\r\nyes ,we might need some obfs module like shadowsocks(r).\r\n\r\nwe can seperate Chinese ZN users into 2 categaries, one with a proxy (ss,ssr,v2ray,brook and so on),the other one don't. and it's easy for the first  categary to connect to trackers and other peers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso my idea is under such assumption \"local ISPs dont have same capabilities as of GFW\",so a Chinese obfs plugin  might  work just to bypass  ISPs,\r\n\r\nand A Chinese obfs plugin might offer such following sub-functions.\r\n\r\nsubfun A. basic obfs tunnel for \"virgin\" client.\r\n\r\n1.this sub func offer simple obfs without need a zeroname ID and work on fixed port and pre-defined encryption algo .fixed port same as mostly common port used in China to p2p servers, such as\r\nxunlei or so on ,fixed algo might simply  use aes-128-gcm and local machine times as \"salt\"\r\n\r\n2.once a new \"virgin\" client has been actviated for the first time ,it can send its registering request using this  predefined encryption protocal to other 5 relay peers,\r\n\r\n3.and  relay peers will decrypt the registering request and forward it to the zeroname server using its own proxy.once registered ,a \"virgin\" peer will go to step 2nd.\r\n4.in step2nd ,a uuid will be generated by \"virgin\" peer itself and exchange its uuid with 5 others using pre-defined protocal , and radomly chooses a more complex encryption and obfs algo for subfuncB \r\n\r\n\r\nsubfunc B. dynamic and varified obfs for peers to peers communications\r\n\r\nin subfuncA a \"virgin\" will got  mature and send and receive encrypted streams for later communications.\r\n\r\n1. a \"mature\" peer communicate with other peers using its own uuid and algo\r\n\r\n2. a \"mature\" peer store a list of friend peers (a set each peers info can be stored as a list: zeroname,uuid  ,obfs algo,port and maybe defined as a channel)and help sharing other peers info to its friends by exchange friend list. \r\n\r\n3. a \"mature\" peers update its friends peers asyncly ,so friends list can be enlarged quickly and keep semi-real-time.\r\n\r\n4. a \"mature\" peers can update its channel with certain period of time \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince this algo is much more complex in de/encryption, new version of pypy  should be considered(pypy and uvloop is fast as golang in async as reported )\r\n\r\n", "added": 1552180857, "modified": 1552192492, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1914#issuecomment-471245824", "source_type": "github"}], "1604067558_mirrored_blurHY_github": [{"comment_id": 3, "body": "what is the advantage of combination of ipfs and zeronet?\r\ncan this solve the problem of being blocked by GFW?", "added": 1571269217, "modified": 1571269217, "source_link": "https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2194#issuecomment-542971258", "source_type": "github"}]}}
