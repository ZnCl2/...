All people using Zeronet knows [torrent](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocole)) (or P2P).\n\nIf you know torrent you knows laws about the illegal download.\n\nBut f*ck the laws i use torrent. And anyone can stop me (Even donald trump cannot stop me). But as even if I can not go to prison because I downloaded Snoopy for my child, I think that would be good :D.\n\nWhen you download with a torrent client (and you use internet,oops zeronet), use a VPN, it's useful: I suggest you those:\n\n-[Tunnelbear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/) (limited to 500 mo/months in free, unlimited as paid)\n\n-(only for bittorrent) [BTGuard](https://btguard.com/) (unlimited but only paid plan)\n\n-[SoftEther VPN Client with VPN Gate](http://www.vpngate.net/en/) (only free, open-source but not so private, because servers are hosted by volunteers)\n\n-Betternet (free but be warry)\n\nAfter the free vpn the paid (unlimited data and fast)\n\n-[ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/) (price ****$3.65**/month and it's best VPN!)**\n\n-[PureVPN](https://www.purevpn.com/) (price **$3.75/month)**\n\n-(the most known) Hide My Ass (or HDA!) (price **$6.55/month)**\n\nI've finished. Have a good day!"
