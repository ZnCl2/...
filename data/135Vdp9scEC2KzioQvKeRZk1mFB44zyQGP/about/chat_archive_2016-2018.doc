napalm: Hey tesla I still believe. Don't self doubt\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Oct 22, 9:57:09pm\par
 Teslaman: Thanks napalm.  No worries, I'm not doubting myself. I've always believed that you reap what you sow, but women have always been my weakness. Not anymore. Too many take advantage and they've cried wolf to me too many times.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Oct 22, 10:02:34pm\par
 Teslaman: I'm not going on a woman hating spree though, there are some great ones out there still. But the ones in porn are not the kind you can trust. Same goes for the guys. They all revel in deceit. I think that's why I never heard from Natasha, even though I know she knew about the fan site. She's one of the good ones. She quit the porn, accepted responsibility for her actions and doesn't go around trying to deceive and manipulate the people who enjoy what she put out there.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Oct 22, 10:19:25pm\par
 Teslaman: And it's not just me, every webmaster got burned that tried working with Hannah, or Luke. The best thing to do is never risk anything with them. As normal guys/gals, we should just enjoy the stuff they put out, but never get involved with them. Treat them as fictitious characters, because they're never genuine with you. It's incredibly sad. I commend anyone though who won't give up on such broken people. You have better resolve than I.\par

napalm: @Teslaman great vid she is lovely. So is there any more hannah content that you may have that hasn't been shared?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Oct 29, 6:24:31pm\par
 Teslaman: Indeed, now that's my kinda strip video!  I shared all except some FB pics/vids. Not missing much there. Was funny, at one point I had made a private offer to Luke, he told her and she accused me of trying to get more in order to share it, lol. Love how it's always opposite of reality.  Me not sharing everything is the one complaint people have! lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Oct 29, 6:25:28pm\par
 Teslaman: http://www.infowars.com/racist-social-justice-warriors-terrorize-owner-of-cat-sanctuary/ I will be so glad when SHTF and these SJWs start dropping like flies. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Oct 29, 6:32:00pm\par
 Teslaman: I would've happily paid to see Hannah do this: https://xhamster.com/movies/2953796/geeky_outdoor_public_nudity_of_sexy_skinny_babe_flashing.html  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Oct 31, 3:20:11am\par
 Teslaman: Happy Halloween! \par
\par
 OR NOT! FFS! If we aren't going to toss these nutjobs in the loony bin, then lets have a Galloween instead. Ahhh, happy thoughts of stringing up SJWs and watching them drop with a sudden stop. How's THAT for fucking triggering!!!!! \par

 Teslaman: avocado\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 2, 2:31:32pm\par
napalm: Hey tesla I take it you seen the anon-ib.co post all about hannah ? It's got her Facebook stuff etc on it\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Nov 3, 12:25:45am\par
 Teslaman: Yup, seen it. That was starting to happen towards the end of her and I speaking. I figure she thinks I'm behind it, given all her accusations and saying stuff that didn't make any rational sense.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Nov 3, 12:47:16am\par
 Teslaman: You see that one double post on there by someone claiming to be her? People LOL'd, but that's exactly the kind of stuff she said. Us being fans is creepy...it was over a decade ago...saving public pics is stealing...lol. It's so out of touch with reality that I was legitimately shocked. I even took the time to write her a long ass email to help open her mind up a bit, but it was like talking to a brick wall.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Nov 3, 1:19:41am\par
 Teslaman: So I'm not bothered anymore with what people do. I just hope new nudes come out somehow to make up for all the shit, lol.  Did you see that one topless picture? Looks a lot like her, but that would mean she actually did do new stuff with someone and just screwed me over some more. Who knows, could have even been one of the offers I passed along that she "rejected". That's the problem with habitual liars, they could say the sky is blue and you would then question if it really was. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Nov 8, 7:45:10am\par
obsydian: woah, cant believe people still are on the hunt for Hannah\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Nov 8, 7:45:56am\par
obsydian: shes gotta be like what 30 now\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 9, 3:50:09am\par
 Teslaman: People will be on the hunt when she's long gone, lol. She's 29 now.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 9, 3:58:38am\par
 Teslaman: I must celebrate now too. Especially after suffering through 8 years of Obamanation. The silent majority has spoken! While I would have preferred Rand Paul, I'll gladly take the alpha male boss man over the sickly mafia crime boss! Hurrah!  Time to grab America by the pussy!  Hillary for Prison 2017! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 9, 4:45:46am\par
 Teslaman: \par
\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 9, 12:33:36pm\par
 Teslaman: Haha, even all the voter fraud and illegals voting couldn't save her!  Funny how he stayed ahead the entire night by 1-2 million, then all the sudden she catches up around 4am. That doesn't smell fishy at all.  At least by next election we should have common sense voter ID laws, a ton of deported illegals and hopefully a reformed voting system that doesn't allow for easy fraud. That'll totally squash like 30% of the Democrat's votes, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 9, 12:42:10pm\par
 Teslaman: And all the millions of Libertarian fools that tried giving it to Hillary by voting for that sellout Gary Johnson! I'm Libertarian too, but not foolish enough to actually risk such a massively corrupt person winning!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 9, 6:26:04pm\par
 Teslaman: These are the people who won the popular vote for Hillary: \par
\par
 I am very thankful they lost! We need an IQ test in order to vote.\par

Justanotherhanfan: New chat?? How have I not seen this before now?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Nov 14, 10:32:50am\par
 Teslaman: Welcome! Yup, added it about a month ago or so.  Maybe your file cache didn't update? These new browsers annoy me that way.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Nov 15, 4:42:30am\par
jasphetamine: @Teslaman I guess I found the bottom of this crazy internet rabbit hole. Originally I was reading about hackers on Insurgency servers. Then... a crazy nostalgia trip leading to a crazy website.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Nov 15, 4:46:57am\par
jasphetamine: I forgot how low-res the hannah and kate's playground videos were that used to blow my mind. Now I'm bummed when a 1080p video isn't 60fps.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 16, 2:26:36am\par
 Teslaman: @jasphetamine Lol, nah, the rabbit hole goes much, much deeper.  This is entry level. Yeah, people have gotten spoiled silly by all the HD. Many almost have a mental breakdown if it isn't HD, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 16, 2:29:33am\par
 Teslaman: Funny you mention kate's playground, since that was the site Karl ripped off to make his hannah-fans scam site, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 4, 5:14:29am\par
 Teslaman: I know people avoid talking about non-porn related stuff on here, but I'll actually take all of you down the rabbit hole...just to see the reactions.  Wanna know why I'm such an odd one? lol It might have something to do with the fact that I've been a lucid dreamer since I was a kid. I haven't had a nightmare since I was about 10 or so. I also manage to turn off certain sensitive street lights when I pass them at night. It happens in any car I'm in and never to the cars ahead of, or behind me. There was one particular row of sensitive ones that I passed almost daily for years. Each night was like a scene out of the movies, which amused me greatly, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 4, 5:15:06am\par
 Teslaman: I haven't tried it for awhile, but I used to hold lights green, to the point that people would notice how we hadn't hit a red light in quite a while, lol. Sure, not fair, but fun.  I used to precisely locate and get rid of my ex's migraine headaches. It was sort of a transference, but only a fading echo. Yes, I was quite happy to eradicate the "I have a headache" excuse, haha. I've had a full on premonition at least once, well in advance, where I quietly recited the entire conversation and actions of the person before they said and did them.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 4, 5:15:26am\par
 Teslaman: I don't get infections, so I never bother to clean cuts. I almost never get sick, but when I do it's almost always sinus/allergy related. I got the flu last year for the first time in about 20 years and was completely over it in 2 days. And yes, it was absolutely the flu. And no, I have not and will never get any of those contaminated vaccines for anything. I haven't had any shots or even been to the doctor in over a decade. Pretty much about as long as Hannah's videos have been out, lmao. Enjoy, internet! "There is more in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy." And any 3 letter organizations and governments....a big "FUCK YOU!" to you all. Haha \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 4, 5:29:06am\par
 Teslaman: Fair warning, if any men in black show up looking to strap me in a chair for some remote viewing, or whatever....you're going to get a 5.56 bullet to the head.  \par

ukguy: @Teslaman As it's nearly Christmas - have a good one! Glad to see this place is still here for a while longer..... UK guy\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 25, 11:38:36am\par
 Teslaman: @ukguy Sorry, I just saw your reply! Merry Christmas to you too!  And yeah, this place will probably be here until I'm dead, lol.  I'll find some way to keep it funded.\par

Wed Dec 28, 3:49:34am\par

Thu Dec 29, 10:41:59am\par
Teslaman: Thanks mrjackpot! Yeah, not sure why those don't show up. I miss this guy from the flash version, haha. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:42:25am\par
mrjackpot:  i see it clearly\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:43:12am\par
 Teslaman: Drat, it doesn't show up the same. It's a little guy who walks across the screen and bangs his head on the side of the chat wall, hahaha. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:48:45am\par
mrjackpot: hahaham, nop it just appears as a little emoji with its toung out  \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 12:33:08pm\par

Thu Dec 29, 12:37:02pm\par
mrjackpot: hehehe indeed we have\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 12:52:09pm\par
Jasefaces: After so many years... it's hard to believe!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 12:52:54pm\par
mrjackpot: i cant wait to see em!!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 12:53:06pm\par
mrjackpot: when they come out.. im going to CUM OUT GOOOD!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 12:53:09pm\par
 Teslaman: Done! New RAR is up! Be cautious with your multi-year blue balls, ur dick might explode in a gory mess from the backpressure! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 4:38:44pm\par
Jasefaces: Fantastic\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 5:08:20pm\par
 Teslaman: @Jasefaces Her pussy and ass truly are.  Wonder if she took any over-the-shoulder shots of her backside?  I hope the old regulars still check their emails, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 5:41:03pm\par
Jasefaces: A guy can dream!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 6:06:00pm\par
mrjackpot: is there any clear pictures of her pussy or her ass.. like in the bunny set? uobviously without the thong/bikini ?? i nice round piece of ass to fuck the shit out off.. and a pussy to bang my rod up to my balls on every stroke hearing her beg for more\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 6:28:59pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, I doubt it, that would require a real camera.  She used to have one that a hopeful fan had gotten her, but if memory serves, her ex took it. I'm quite grateful right now that she doesn't still have her Blackberry, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 9:29:39pm\par
mrjackpot: hopefully another dude can give her another camara as a gift for her to take HQ pictures of herself\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:15:57pm\par
 Teslaman: I guess, I'm just wondering what other goodies @GenericAnomynous might have in store for us! It keeps getting better and better! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:16:34pm\par
mrjackpot: would he upload more? awesome!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:17:07pm\par
mrjackpot: hopefully better pictures! ass! pussy! a tribute in her name will be done!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:18:20pm\par
mrjackpot: cause if i dont bad recall the pictures.. the one with the gold corset was somewhat censored,.,, right?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:23:27pm\par
 Teslaman: Nah, wasn't censored, just too far away to see detail. Was only like a 2MP camera or something.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:24:31pm\par
mrjackpot: but everything looks good.. except the pussy... like it somehow erased or blurried.., shame.. those where great pictures back then \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 29, 10:32:23pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, nah, looks normal if you zoom it in. The focus was just elsewhere, plus she has a nice slit, so there's not the big meat curtains to give it detail.  And Luke didn't have the software back then for that kind of editing, as you can tell from other pics, he just used Paint to slap things on. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Dec 30, 2:03:24pm\par
Shalkien: Holy shit man the new pics and vids are amazing thanks to the anon that shared.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Dec 30, 2:07:25pm\par
 Teslaman: Absolutely! I'd say this is the best end of the year I've probably ever had, lmao! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Dec 30, 2:08:43pm\par
shalkien: Made mine a lot better. Did the anon say if there was more or is that all he going to give\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Dec 30, 2:13:08pm\par
 Teslaman: He said he has 100s of pics and more vids, but we'll have to wait and see what all else he might be able to safely share. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Dec 30, 2:24:02pm\par
shalkien: I can't wait\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Dec 30, 8:40:09pm\par
 Teslaman: Same here! 7 years later and I still stayed awake for 36hrs after the news hit, lol. The vampire is back! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Dec 31, 2:28:07am\par
Jasefaces: Haha, take care of yourself man\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Dec 31, 5:21:42am\par
 Teslaman: Thanks, I just need some more virgin blood! lol  I wonder if Anon will do a round 3 2016 send off today.  What's everyone's favs so far? \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Dec 31, 12:44:30pm\par
screwhead: Happy New Year everyone\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Dec 31, 1:55:57pm\par
 Teslaman: Happy New Year to you too!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Dec 31, 5:09:33pm\par
 Teslaman: Ok, I'll go first, lol. I have several favs, including that full body black lace pic, but I'm particularly fond of IMG-20160423-WA0018 since it's public.  And while I do love tits the most, that ass shot is grand. She has the perfect type of ass IMO! She just needs to not point the light at the camera, haha. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 1, 8:50:39am\par
Justanotherhanfan: Mr Anon - I am forever in your debt. Thank you for making our dreams a reality. Here's hoping for more!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 1, 9:28:12am\par
justanotherhanfan: She's certainly still got it!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 1, 5:45:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Indeed she does! Yeah, I can't wait to hear back from our amazing benefactor!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 12:50:36am\par
 Teslaman: Alrighty, it doesn't make sense now to not add most of the other pictures that I had saved, so I've updated the archive with those too!  Some of them are already out there anyways, since they were/are shared publicly on social media.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:19:31am\par
justanotherhanfan: Nice collection building up now!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:19:35am\par
justanotherhanfan: Thanks.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:22:19am\par
 Teslaman: Indeed and you're most welcome! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:56:27am\par
Jasefaces: Awesome, I missed the return pics and the social stuff is new to me. I always seemed to check back just after it had been taken down lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:56:46am\par
Jasefaces: Gotta say my favourite is IMG-20160409-WA0026 - I'm very much a rack guy\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:57:22am\par
Jasefaces: Hah, I'd love to see her when she found out about all this, to know it's happened again\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:57:35am\par
Jasefaces: After everything that happened it's epic justice\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:58:47am\par
 Teslaman: Ah lol, third time is the charm then!  Oh yes, that one is splendid!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 7:59:17am\par
 Teslaman: Ha! I'm sure we will get to find out one of these days, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 8:02:46am\par
 Teslaman: Although, last time wasn't actually a leak from Luke like she claimed. I know for a fact that she was totally engaged in doing all of it. She cammed, talked to producers about doing professional shoots, was planning that UKHotty site with Luke, etc. She loved to BS about it though.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 8:04:56am\par
Jasefaces: I see\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 8:05:43am\par
Jasefaces: Always with the bs\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 8:07:40am\par
 Teslaman: Yup, from day one, lol. It was pretty funny, I forgot some of the stuff she said when she first showed up in chat. I saw it again on the one archive page, where I had caught her in the lie about it already, lol. I thought I had those chats archived somewhere...maybe I do, but I can't find the ones that go back that far.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 8:10:18am\par
 Teslaman: This one: http://web.archive.org/web/20090329082004/http://www.babes-n-amateurs.com/Hannah\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 8:16:58am\par
 Teslaman: Wish her message showed up there, but we all know the story. "I didn't know about any of it, he dumped them in revenge...blah blah blah. " lol  Anyways...back to ogling the new stuff! LMAO!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 2, 8:38:31am\par
 Teslaman: I'm fond of those free hanging pigtail pics too. Wish the light hadn't somewhat washed those out though. Would love to see some more free hanging pics. A bouncing video would be amazing too! I might need the paramedics handy on that one, lol! \par

justanotherhanfan: Who is the 'anon' that's lurking in the active users bit?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 3, 8:41:36am\par
 Teslaman: Me, lol. I have it open on another PC so I maybe hear the chat noise when I'm zonked out, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 3, 8:42:33am\par
justanotherhanfan: oh haha! I wonder if Han has heard the news yet!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 3, 8:44:24am\par
 Teslaman: Probably not....unless she's the leaker, lmao! Wouldn't be the first time chicks have done that, haha. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 3, 8:45:34am\par
justanotherhanfan: Haha well she's always welcome to leak as much as she likes!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 3, 8:46:45am\par
 Teslaman: Indeed! All are welcome! \par

Tue Jan 3, 8:53:47am\par
justanotherhanfan: \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 3, 8:56:57am\par
 Teslaman:  Would certainly make up for a lot! I'd say this makes up for about 10% so far, lol.\par

napalm: I go away for two weeks and someone does something amazing. Massive thanks\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 4, 1:57:11pm\par
napalm: Hey tesla so that far rar you have on site is that all the new stuff yo u was sent or is there still more to follow? Will you be drip feeding us them or dumping the whole lot on us\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 4, 2:11:14pm\par
Teslaman: Yep, that's all of what he uploaded so far. He said he has a lot more though, so fingers crossed! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 4, 8:31:50pm\par
 Teslaman: I was just remembering the time back in the 2009 chat on here when she was talking about wanting implants, lol. Why on earth? *does motorboat* That had to be more BS, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 5, 4:04:49am\par
 Teslaman: Wait a minute...is that masturbation video really her?  Just noticed that arm has a colored tat on top, which unless she just recently got it, she doesn't have! The codec data doesn't match the other video either. It's also from May, when everything else is from April. Ermmm. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 5, 4:26:58am\par
 Teslaman: Confirmed from a November picture, no top arm tat on the hand without the birthmark.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 6, 10:16:12am\par
Justanotherhanfan: @Teslaman so it's not her in the vid? Damn.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 6, 3:52:03pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah I don't see how it could be her. I've removed it from the archive. I guess we're not going to hear back from the leaker either. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 8, 4:58:19am\par
Justanotherhanfan: That's a shame on both counts. I guess we should be grateful for what we've got already.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 8, 5:04:29am\par
Teslaman: Indeed, although they are still lurking.  \par

Mon Jan 9, 2:55:04am\par
smee: did we have new pics now? I wanna see more of her\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 3:49:38am\par
Teslaman: Yep, they're in the archive via the download link, plus one short video. I agree, seeing more would be fantastic!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:12:06am\par
smee: i know them and theyre very hot. Did you know when new ones here?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:14:03am\par
Teslaman: I don't know, but hopefully more soon!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:14:29am\par
smee: i hope so too, i hope we got some real hardcore Action \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:16:27am\par
Teslaman: Indeed, that would be amazing!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:17:18am\par
smee: is it from an exfriend of her? I dont think she will post direktly but also she was or is a swingergirl....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:20:08am\par
Teslaman: Nah, he said they never got to meet.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:21:19am\par
smee: oh ok. so maybee there is a Forum or a swingersite where they came from... i dont know\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:22:20am\par
Teslaman: Oh, no I think she met him online when she was single and looking, like on a dating site and sent them to him.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:23:00am\par
smee: maybee but very great stuff, i hope he get more of her\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:24:24am\par
Teslaman: Yeah, he said he has more, but we shall see. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:25:04am\par
smee: i hope we see soon, shes a real queen\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:27:24am\par
Teslaman: Hehe, yeah.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 9, 5:29:45am\par
smee: so i will look if i find more about her, but also i didnt think so\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 5:38:38am\par
Teslaman: Yeah, that honeybunchesofhannah is a fake that someone made years ago. Her real Myspace, sexyhannah, disappeared a few years back.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 7:10:22am\par
smee: oh ok. so we will see what happens next time\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 8:19:23am\par
anon2295: @Teslaman @Jasefaces this is a weird hobby\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 4:27:03pm\par
Teslaman: It's the porn version of following celebs, nothing weird about it. Just like with celebs, there are quite a number of places that have dedicated sections to their fav pornstar. Even vintage ones that are so old the pornstar is dead now, lol. I personally don't follow any celebs at all, so I guess it had to express itself somewhere, lol. What is weird to me, is not understanding something so common and basic about human behavior. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 6:03:09pm\par
theloafinggopher: @Teslaman Yo, just a quick message to say nice one for the site. Came across a comp vid of her earlier and totally took me back down memory lane! Amazed that the girl in the vid had all this going on while I thought it was just some bellend of a bf putting their stuff online! She was stunning though so I'm pleased its satisfied some curiosity for myself. Fair play to you pal!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 6:06:01pm\par
Teslaman: Cheers!  Yeah, that is what she tried getting everyone to believe, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 7:07:15pm\par
smee: you mean she knows that the porn goes online and wants to make some Money?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 10, 8:39:45pm\par
Teslaman: In 2004-05, yes, she was an active participant and wanted to make some money. Now? No, she knows how popular she is and doesn't want to make easy money, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 11, 8:34:09am\par
smee: thats bad, i think Pierre Woodman will have some real fun with her.....lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 12, 8:51:33am\par
Teslaman: Lol, yeah she def wouldn't go the pro route, which is a good thing IMO.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 12, 11:19:03am\par
anon0994: found a facebook account that claims to be her based in kent but it's all old pics (one looks to be from a formal she had in HS) and hasn't been touched in 3 years (found 2 actually but the other was US based which was just SAD\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 12, 11:22:44am\par
Teslaman: Ah lol, yeah any fb with her old pics is fake. She doesn't use it like that. Speaking of US, I had one guy even impersonate me! Was a PITA getting that taken down.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 12, 12:12:25pm\par
Teslaman: Wish our mysterious benefactor would check his PMs, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 12, 9:24:34pm\par
0994: yea i figured it was fake cause it said she worked at coca cola and the last post was her "helping a friend" to get AV performers i looked up the company name and the only hit is a low budget talent agency it was really only interesting cause of the pic from some formal she went to (btw downloaded the pics last night and damn if she isn't kinda a MILF now even if she is a bitch)\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 12, 10:08:15pm\par
Teslaman: Indeed, she a fine bitch. lol  Ah, yeah I think I know the picture you're talking about. White dress with greenery background?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 13, 9:39:17am\par
smee: so hope the mysterious benefactor will send us more of her. Hope she will go the pro route some day, so she will be a real star and earn a lot of Money...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 13, 10:09:46am\par
screwhead: Something new? How about this one? https://up5.xhcdn.com/000/120/125/372_1000.jpg\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 13, 10:32:25am\par
smee: its not the newest....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 13, 3:25:37pm\par
leo: how do i see the new pics?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 13, 5:44:15pm\par
Teslaman: @smee She could earn a lot of money without going pro too.  @screwhead It's a sexy ass pic that I wish we had the good quality original of. @leo Both the gallery and download are on the main page. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 14, 5:06:41pm\par
Teslaman: Turns out that Hannah knows since a few days ago, is threatening police action via the ridiculous new UK revenge porn laws and says there will be no more pics or vids for our misogynistic objectification.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 14, 5:10:44pm\par
Teslaman: As I said, she turned into a feminazi. Good to see she admits to having hurt/victimized a dude, since revenge isn't possible otherwise. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 14, 5:25:32pm\par
Teslaman: Which let me just say that I firmly believe in an eye for an eye, aka retaliation, aka vengeance, aka revenge, aka true justice and will gladly debate and destroy anyone on the subject.  Let me summarize "revenge porn" laws for you. A victim gets justice, then the law harshly punishes said victim even further! Lovely. But if a woman kills her violent abuser, we generally let them off the hook, since you know, it's just wrong to further punish the victim.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 14, 5:33:33pm\par
Teslaman: After what she did and said, I just don't care anymore one way or the other. I'm just enjoying the new stuff for what it is. Porn.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 14, 11:43:27pm\par
Justanotherhanfan: Well the saga continues. All I'll say is that while she's nice to look at, when all is said and done, she's just a bit of a dick.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 15, 6:56:55am\par
Teslaman: Hopefully that saga contains more videos, lol. Yup, but don'tcha know, it's all of us who need to change! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 15, 12:56:28pm\par
Justanotherhanfan: Come on anons... chat!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 15, 12:57:21pm\par
Justanotherhanfan: @Teslaman we'll never change while those titties are around!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 15, 2:58:54pm\par
Teslaman: Haha, indeed! Feminists want us to be women and that just isn't going to happen. I won't incredibly embarrass her publicly over the things I've heard her say privately over the years, but it's very clear that she has no understanding of men and deems our natural behavior to be wrong. It doesn't matter that plenty of other women understand, accept and even use our ways to their advantage, we're just all wrong, lol.  Funny enough, feminists destroy their feminine power, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 15, 4:45:58pm\par
Teslaman: And yeah, so many anons just lurk. Hard to type one handed I guess. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 15, 11:09:42pm\par
Teslaman: Surprised I didn't hear from her, but no doubt she still doesn't want to make amends. I wonder if the guy who shared these will confirm what she has said or not. Or share more. Or ask me to take them down. lol All the silence seems strange to me.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 17, 5:58:18pm\par
0994: there is a big difference between a feminist and a misandrist the main difference is that Misandrists are like vegans they won't shut the fuck up about how they are feminist and won't be happy till men are scared to even look at women real feminists just want women to have equal pay and right etc. most porn stars are actually femminists mysandrists call them gender traitors\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 18, 1:13:40am\par
anon3091: wait wait wait.... are the pictures in the imgur album at the top of the page new hannah pictures?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 18, 11:46:27am\par
 Teslaman: @0994 I agree, although I would say that those "real feminists" still shouldn't label themselves as such, because feminism has always had misandry at its core. It lures women in with equal pay and all that, but mostly it's about destroying the family and dividing the sexes. Division is inherent to all movements that only focus on the rights of one group, instead of making it about human rights. @anon3091 Indeed they are new Hannah pictures!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 18, 1:59:36pm\par
 Teslaman: But that's why I don't call her a misandrist, since she was more the typical pornstar feminist who has become jaded and intolerant of men being men. It's the more subtle man hating, the likes of which has been seen in most sitcoms for a long time now. So she hasn't gone full on dark side yet and is still mostly feminine. No butch, multicolored hair and refusal to shave yet, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 18, 2:08:16pm\par
 Teslaman: Old Hannah was normal, but now she has let assholes jade her. Instead of not letting bad things change you, you adopt a victim mentality about everything. Given my past, I was guilty of that for a time too, which is why I easily recognize it in others. Still, that's not excusing the things she has said/done, only that it's the reason behind it. People who blame their bad actions on the bad things that happened to them, get zero sympathy from me. You are responsible for being a shit person, no one else is. Anyways, was trying to keep that short, but I never can seem to, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 20, 3:39:02pm\par
0994: no i'd argue that the FIRST feminists meaning the women of the suffrage movement Legitimately wanted equal rights it was really only in the 70's that women decided they needed to punnish men for what our grandfathers did\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 20, 5:14:05pm\par
Teslaman: Oh I agree, it certainly started with those legitimate types. I meant the established feminism with all its doctrine. But, the bad element is always there to some degree, and it tends to take over with time. That's why I'm not crazy about MRA either, because while they are fighting for a lot of legitimate things, it's bound to turn ugly. It already is in some ways, with those MGTOWs. Even when you do make it about general human rights, people still manage to get a bit nuts, lol. But, it's much harder to get stuck in your own little corner when it's about everyone and not just your group.  For me it's about what is right and not women, men, black, white, etc etc. That's kinda rare and is why I go into a misanthropic mood sometimes, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 20, 5:14:53pm\par
Teslaman: Anyways, back to teh titties! lol  Where did the dude go? Hannah must be pounding his balls with a meat tenderizer. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 20, 5:20:36pm\par
smee: i wanna see her in a Gangbang with 35 Guys....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 20, 5:32:04pm\par
Teslaman: Sounds like your average day now in Germany or Sweden.  Ha!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 20, 7:08:46pm\par
anon0118: So are these imgur pics at the top of the page new pics? Or old pics? If they are new, she's still razor fine.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 20, 8:10:01pm\par
Teslaman: Yep, new pics from 2016. 11+ years after the old stuff! Yeah she is still quite hot! Hope she's saving all this stuff to sell when she feels over the hill. Now that's a solid retirement plan! LOL! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 21, 10:01:04am\par
anon0063: Did she send them to you? Or did you find them? Is there more on the way?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 21, 10:54:50am\par
0994: Yea the mra is gamerate with a diffrent name no matter how it started its become somthing else\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 21, 3:49:11pm\par
Teslaman: @anon0063 Supposedly some guy she wronged sent them to me, but I have no idea really who it was. No one is talking. I highly doubt it was her, but stranger things have happened, lol. There isn't more on the way that I know of, but I sure hope there will be! @0994 Well most MRAs are doing good right now, but eventually it will turn for the worse.\par

Sun Jan 22, 6:22:30am\par
anon9831: I'm still holding my breath for more though, those dildo videos sounded awesome, hopefully we get to see those one day.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 22, 8:58:36am\par
smee: yes, but also i dont think we will get more of here, im surprised really that we have new stuff... We will see what happend, hope we will get more stuff soon\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 22, 6:54:08pm\par
Teslaman: @anon9831 Same here! All around the best end and beginning of a year I've had! Yeah, wish the one masturbation video hadn't been a fake.\par

RaynMan21: thnks for the email teslaman (aragog) what a suprise i had, what a start to a new year! if you dont mind could you give me the background on what happened via email if you can. Anything been held back? i also note shes dissapeared from FB, does she know about the new photos?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 24, 4:28:46pm\par
Teslaman: Indeed! Best New Year I've had, lol. Oh sure, but it's all public, the background info and content. Literally nothing happened behind the scene this time. She has had her FB on lock down for a while, but yes she knows.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 28, 4:06:53am\par

longtimefan27: Hey all! Long time lover of Hannah - first time finder of this chat!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Feb 9, 3:11:56pm\par
longtimefan27: Very excited about new content. Over the years I've had all the pics and vids, but don't anymore. Any of you guys know of an easy place to get them? Thanks!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Feb 9, 3:18:54pm\par
longtimefan27: Also, what happened at the end of the threesome vid? It seems to stop very abruptly.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Feb 9, 5:19:37pm\par
Teslaman: @longtimefan27: If I remember correctly, the claim was that Luke failed to bring a backup battery and the camera died. There is no shortage of lies with them though, so it's impossible to say without seeing the unedited footage. It's a bit odd how none of the hardcore videos have a proper ending.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Feb 10, 1:41:06am\par
longtimefan27: @teslaman Yep, that's the rumour I heard years ago too, thanks for confirming! I think I've managed to find most of her content last night, but do you guys know of a complete pack anywhere? Thanks!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Feb 10, 7:39:10am\par
longtimefan27: Also, I see you had a fansite for 'Natasha' - I've never heard of her - who is she?! Thanks for taking the time to answer!\par

anon7645: Has Hanna got new videos?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Feb 10, 10:54:26am\par
Teslaman: @longtimefan27: Nah I don't know of any place online that has a complete pack. Sure thing, this is Natasha: http://www.xvideos.com/video10623286/504357_-_natasha_strips_and_masturbates A sweet, hot southern US girl who made a brief appearance doing some camshows. @anon7645 There's one short new tit play video in the download archive. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Feb 19, 2:45:06am\par
Teslaman: Not to be alarmist, but if you guys don't hear back from me, then I didn't make it. Not joking!\par

Sun Feb 19, 7:45:47am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Surgery? Penis reduction?? \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Feb 19, 8:21:30am\par
Teslaman: Debilitating, constant, sharp stabbing pain, fever and I collapsed/blacked out once earlier, almost twice but I managed to sit first. And no, not appendix, different area. Pain and fever isn't as bad now. Took a natural antibiotic, not sure if that's what is helping though. This pain has oddly been coming and going for weeks, but no where even close to this bad. Hope this is the end of it, but it's obviously pretty serious, so I wanted to mention it just in case.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Feb 19, 10:05:05am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: @Teslaman good luck man. Sure you'll be fine, these are professionals we're talking about.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Feb 19, 8:43:30pm\par
Teslaman: Oh, well this will probably shock most people, but I didn't go to the hospital. If I end up in one, it likely wasn't by my own choosing. The majority of doctors here are a joke, especially after so many good ones quit due to obamacare. They're more likely to accidentally kill you than anything. If I can't handle it on my own from research/treatment, then so be it. Most things are not hard really, I even freaked someone out by correctly diagnosing them from thousands of miles away, just based on the symptoms they mentioned, lol. I'm almost certain I know what this is, it couldn't be anything else really, but it's not good that it got this bad.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Feb 22, 4:00:17am\par
Teslaman: @JustAnotherHanFan Thanks for the good luck wishes, looks like I'm pretty much back to normal now.  Never have I blacked out until my 30s, now it's been too many times. Oh well, look on the bright side, if I drop dead I'm sure it'll make a few people happy! I aim to please! Haha! \par

Teslaman: So Hannah and I talked again last week, supposedly in hopes of finally resolving things between us. It went absolutely nowhere though, since she just repeated all the same, wrong, retarded shit as last year, which I corrected yet again. Having a repeat convo just proves you don't listen, read, or actually care to change anything. It's like listening to the talking points of the typical politician. I'd love to resolve things, but that's a bit difficult to do when the other person won't acknowledge simple facts, because those facts don't fit their narrative. *sigh*\par

longtimefan27: nightmare!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Feb 25, 9:02:56am\par
Teslaman: Indeed! I wouldn't even mention it, if we had actually gotten anywhere this time, but nope, same old BS that ends in silence. Because of that, I've decided to add more private chat proof excerpts, like that April 2015 one. Normally, I refuse to share anything from private convos, but push the same tired shit over and over again and I certainly will. I'll get another one added to prove the paysite discussions/plans.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Feb 25, 2:32:31pm\par
longtimefan27: I'm obviously being completely inept here, but I can't see those chat excerpts! Could you direct me to them? Thanks!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Feb 25, 2:34:13pm\par
longtimefan27: Cancel! I found them!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Feb 25, 5:51:53pm\par
Teslaman: Ok, I've added 6 total, 5 in the paysite paragraph and 1 above that one. That's enough digging for now, I need to do other stuff today, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Feb 26, 10:20:26am\par
Teslaman: Also, if she wanted to actually resolve things, then she wouldn't continue antagonizing by using more fake accounts to pretend to be other people. Like making a new fake google account on Feb 9th in order to try some info gathering, only to have her son accidentally out her by taking over the account and making it his own. Oops! LMAO! Admittedly it was confusing at first as to what happened there, but that is the only explanation. Then she actually tries to continue the deception with an incredibly poor excuse and pretends to be a guy. She made it quite obvious that it was her really, but I was too tired at the moment to catch it. I had stayed up over 24hrs again, since I was actually being sincere in my desire to make amends. Clearly, she doesn't give a shit either way.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Feb 26, 12:02:33pm\par
rebenn: @Teslaman Man, I'm so sorry for what's happening... What a fucking shitstorm... I've just discovered this website, only to find out it's already closed, and Hannah's been treating you like shit...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Feb 26, 11:04:36pm\par
 Teslaman: @rebenn Thanks for that! Yeah it's friggin' nuts! I miss the old, fun days! I'm really fed up with the childish games of making fake accounts to defend oneself. If that shit doesn't stop, then expect more info to come out! If you think that bit above was funny, then you haven't heard anything yet! Also, make no mistake people, I write this friggin' much on everything, lol. I never used to, but stuff just flows out of me now with passionate vigor. She called me intense one time. Damn straight and proud of it! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Feb 28, 9:55:23am\par
longtimefan27: I'm sure I speak for a LOT of people when I say I appareciate everything you've done and tried to do over the years! I'm fascinated by the whole backstory - almost as interested in that as I am in Hannah naked!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Feb 28, 7:13:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Thanks, yeah that seems to be the consensus. The only ones who don't, are the ones who talk like they know me, when they very clearly don't. Ha! Yeah I suppose it's quite an enthralling read to a lot of people. Quite a different thing for me, but I get it. I've sent her a very sincere email today that if she actually ignores that one, then there's nothing else I can do.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 2, 3:49:19am\par
longtimefan27: Cool, keep us up-to-date on what happens if you can!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 3, 11:07:29am\par
 Teslaman: SSDD unfortunately. Sorry for the downtime, my internet was terminated yesterday for some unspecified reason. I'm back on now and will no longer be admin of the site, so that it may continue.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 3, 4:37:45pm\par
 Teslaman: Ok, we're back up and running.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 4, 2:29:11am\par
longtimefan27: So who's admin - and why not you?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 4, 2:43:35am\par
 Teslaman: Someone no one knows on here.  Seemed like the wise move, considering. Whatever the reason for my ISP termination, I'm thankful, as I now have 4x faster speeds for a cheaper price! Woo-hoo! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 8, 6:48:40pm\par
 Teslaman: I should clarify that if we both agree, then I can still close the site, but if I'm gone for any reason, then it still goes on. Which is especially true of the new ZeroNet .bit mirror site, as I'm the only one with the keys, but it's otherwise completely independent and censor proof. I don't expect this to ever change, since it's all quite literally been the SSDD. So enjoy!  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 8, 7:12:37pm\par
marcopolo: heeey! I read the story u put on the main, duuuuuuuuuuude crazy to think thats things happen and how things that she done in the past still alive, its crazy (not judging, just wondering about).\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 8, 7:14:04pm\par
marcopolo: Many years ago (2009) I run on a contest on her old website (hanna-fans) and I won, but I wont received the prize lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 8, 7:15:14pm\par
marcopolo: and today I saw a girl like her on the street and I remebered this, then I search about her on the web and found this website telling all the story lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 8, 8:09:18pm\par
 Teslaman: Indeed, the things you do have lifelong consequences, but especially when you leave your foot in the door for a decade afterwards, lol. Yeah that's classic hannah-fans for you, lol. Hope you didn't get scammed out of any money! Glad I could fill in some blanks for you. Some people still don't get it that being stabbed in the back by a so-called friend with the Karl blade, is the entire cause/reason for the current state of the site. Such is life, eh?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Mar 13, 1:28:50am\par
 Teslaman: Uploading is back, as well as the Bitcoin Donation for anyone who wants to help with hosting costs. You can also help for free by running ZeroNet and seeding the backup site. Yep, it works like a torrent.  Oh and Happy Fapping! \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 16, 6:42:50am\par
anon6480: i just read the whole story and... WOW, just wow! I've been a fan of UK Hannah since i accidentally came on one of her videos (excuse my poor choice of words, i'm french  ) Such a disappointment knowing i spent years thinking you were an unstained goddess, one above petty humans like the rest of us. It's sad to see how the whole story went down... But still, I'm happy to know that she's doing good (thanks for the pictures btw she looks awesome!).\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 16, 6:58:03am\par
justanotherhanfan: The Emma Watson photos have to be the worst 'celeb leak' i've ever seen. Hardly worth bothering with.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 16, 2:31:39pm\par
fred: I read the story as well, its such a shame! so there is no chance of any 2017 pic updates, the 2016 were good!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 16, 4:40:38pm\par
 Teslaman: @anon6480: @fred: Yeah, sometimes it really sucks to see behind the masks that people wear. On one hand I hate to bust the fantasy, but then on the other I can't stand such people getting away with that BS and fooling everyone. @justanotherhanfan: Heh, yeah not much win and I don't care for her at all anyways, but plenty of others do. I've never even watched those Potter movies, lol, they have zero interest to me. But there are plenty of popular shows/movies I haven't seen, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 16, 4:47:14pm\par
 Teslaman: @fred Oh and I dunno on any 2017 updates, guess it all depends on if the guy comes back to share more. According to some people, there will be no more, but we've all heard that before, lol.\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 22, 11:31:06pm\par
 Teslaman: Same Shit Different Day, from one of my favs, "Dreamcatcher".  In other words, the convo was a pointless 3rd time repeat where I again spent the whole time correcting the wrong stuff she says/thinks. Not that it ever seems to matter anyways, but I just can't let it fly when it's so very wrong. Clearly she doesn't listen, or care one bit to remember and still doesn't feel bad at all for the things she said/did. So we'll never get anywhere in that case, just the SSDD.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 1:31:48am\par
 Teslaman: Does anyone want more regular pics? That's like around half of what I have.  I just picked out the gooduns.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 12:06:31pm\par
spazzyjeff: 'Regular'...?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 2:25:09pm\par
spazzyjeff: Anything relating to Hannah, it's an emphatic yes from my corner.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 2:33:27pm\par
spazzyjeff: PS Great work on keeping everything going in the face of trying circumstances, you're a hero.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:09:37pm\par
 Teslaman: Ok. Hehe, cheers, yeah it's just the more something tries to knock me down, the harder I fight back. Especially when I've been wronged, then I go into suicide bomber mode, lol.  Unlike some people, I never forget. I don't know what's wrong with some people who think that a person online doesn't matter, because it's not "real life". Those are some seriously fucked individuals.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:10:43pm\par
longtimefan27: Hell yes! More pics would be great!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:13:01pm\par
longtimefan27: Also, I love Dreamcatcher - one of my favourite King novels. My all-time favourite is Duma Key.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:16:39pm\par
 Teslaman: I'll get to sorting then.  Oh cool! Gotta admit I don't know that one, but I'm pretty hap hazard with following things, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:28:02pm\par
spazzyjeff: Top man. Maybe someday you'll be able to sell the film rights and it'll all seem worthwhile.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:32:28pm\par
 Teslaman: Ha, I dunno about all that.  But now I'm thinking of titles, lol. Mask of the Vixen? haha\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:41:19pm\par
spazzyjeff: 'With Foxes we must play The Fox'\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 3:51:57pm\par
 Teslaman: Nice.  Vixen Mask...there we go. Plays well together given the dual, opposing meanings to the word. Not to mention the female fox meaning. Think I nailed it on the first go, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 4:14:56pm\par
spazzyjeff: Superb. I'll go through the back story and start penning a script .\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 4:42:24pm\par
 Teslaman: That'll be interesting.  For the poster, I'm picturing a headshot of the sexy vixen, using my fav peekaboo hairstyle ala Jessica Rabbit, wearing a porcelain mask. Revealed side is white and lovely, other side is blood red and menacing.  Background should be worn down victorian gothic style with some contrasting average girly elements. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 5:10:45pm\par
spazzyjeff: Like the attention to detail! I'm in England so I can ensure authcenticity  Look forward to the new dump!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 5:23:54pm\par
 Teslaman: Thanks!  Hehe, indeed, although I'm sure my side would need some input too for the American authenticity.  Evangeline Lilly can play adult Hannah.  I dunno about me. If this was the early 90s, then I'd say Dean Cain would be perfect.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 5:34:34pm\par
spazzyjeff: A transatlantic tale of deception then. Yes I agree with the casting decision, as.I suppose it would be too much of a stretch to imagine Hannah might come aboard and collaborate:D\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 5:39:57pm\par
 Teslaman: Haha, yeah only if you want it rewritten to be more like Colin Hanks "Alone with Her", lmao!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 5:54:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Zachary Quinto could play me in her version, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 5:58:39pm\par
spazzyjeff: Ha, no. Think we need to paint you in a better light than that, by telling the truth for a start! I suggest auditioning potential Hannah's wih the pink belt scene... \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 6:04:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Haha, indeed. Hers would be typical Hollywood, aka totally fabricated, lol. Sounds like a plan! lol \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 6:19:25pm\par
anon7381: heyas... is it literally impossible to download the 2016 set? No matter what I do, it doesn't work.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 6:30:24pm\par
spazzyjeff: Haha, yeah, probably end up throwing in a car chase for good measure.... Really enjoy seeing Hannah in later life actually (clothed and otherwise). Helps me 'flesh' out the character \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 6:37:33pm\par
 Teslaman: @anon7381 Yeah some people have problems with multiup, they seem to change the page depending on country. My fav DDL site uses them and I've always used JDownloader, bypassing the browser entirely, so I didn't know it was such a pita, lol. Now that the site is hosted, it'll be switched to a direct link before long.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 6:42:49pm\par
 Teslaman: @spazzyjeff Lol, no doubt. Totally agree on seeing the recent stuff, wink wink nudge nudge. lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 6:52:21pm\par
spazzyjeff: How recent? Are we up to date? Gagging for more now!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 7:20:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh yeah, the most recent stuff is on here. I just have quite a bit more regular pics too. According to the leaker though, there is quite a bit more of the good stuff! Maybe he'll come back for next Christmas, lol. One can hope!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 7:40:13pm\par
spazzyjeff: I see, whats the nature of the 'regular' ones? Fapworthy? haha\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 8:05:14pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, some no doubt are, others might be for some, but probably half aren't. Looks like there's a little over 150 more I could add. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 8:09:39pm\par
spazzyjeff: Ace. Would really appreciate it. Can't come quick enough for me, those newer ones where H is thicker are great, I may even find her sexier that way.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 8:28:54pm\par
 Teslaman: I'll pick out some to add now, others need some editing first. Yeah seems some people expect her to keep the tight teen bod. I don't think they're used to seeing women or something, lol. There are some heavier pics too from a few years back. All things considered, she does a good job staying in shape. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 8:35:59pm\par
spazzyjeff: Cheers mate. The more the merrier. You're a legend. Yeah, agree on the body shape - if it means a big bust and a round bum then I'm not averse to a bit of filling out, and she's still got a twinkle in her eye. Got me carried away thinking about it now, wonder what and where shes up to.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 8:39:24pm\par
 Teslaman: Yup, that's filling out in the right places.  Hmm, lets see, late Friday night, prob passed out from drunkenness, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 9:31:28pm\par
 Teslaman: Ok, ones with a red border are the newest additions since the archive. Got a thicker one added from exactly 5 years ago. Some of these are tiny, so I enlarged them a little. Really, I added the best ones first.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 9:35:14pm\par
spazzyjeff: Hero. Apprciate it, thanks!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 9:45:47pm\par
spazzyjeff: Are they in the gallery? Iam having the same issue with the Download link as the previous guy - it just doesnt seem to work for me.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 10:22:47pm\par
 Teslaman: Yep in the gallery. The new additions are scattered since the regular pics are sorted by year, which is why I added the red outline. Ah, yeah it should have a big download button towards the bottom in the middle, or a captcha first, then show a list of download mirrors after clicking that.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 24, 11:55:26pm\par
 Teslaman: Got 18 added for now, mostly from 2010. Also got the direct download added. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 2:35:43am\par
 Teslaman: I also lengthened the main page with another paragraph. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 3:06:50am\par
longtimefan27: Teslaman, you're a God amongst men.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 3:55:01am\par
 Teslaman: Aw shucks.  lol  Cheers!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 6:01:39am\par
longtimefan27: I think I have all the readily available pictures now. Any more would be totally welcome!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 7:39:48am\par
 Teslaman: There will be 100+ more to come.  These will just take longer to add since I have to crop and/or resize a fair bit of them. Some I will have to spend some time photoshopping to remove certain individuals. I dare not say who, because even the mention of the word is ghastly offensive to some very hypocritical, prim and proper acting people! haha  What are those baby goats called again? *cough* lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 11:00:56am\par
spazzyjeff: Thanks Tez. Top work. Presumably a lot of these are pulled from social media accounts etc? Does she have any active accounts floating about? Obviously she went under the radar a bit after doing a U-turn on her desire to be an internet celebrity! Would love to get to the bottom of this anonymous uploader situation, it must be driving you nuts.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 11:59:26am\par
spazzyjeff: I'm a recent journalism grad; genuinely might look into doing a human interest piece on the whole saga!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 12:09:23pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol, just got a letter inviting me to join the State Sherrifs' Association.  Yep, nearly all are from FB, which is the active one, but it's on total lockdown now due to someone posting the link around. She made some claims about that, but I decided not to repeat them since I've personally seen no evidence that it's true. Oh yeah, it's been driving me nuts, lol. I might have figured out who it is, but I'm waiting to hear back from them. Oh now that would be interesting to see how that turned out, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 12:36:12pm\par
spazzyjeff: State Sherrifs' Association is a reference that goes above my head a bit (being British) but congratulations if it's something worthy of them! Not suprised she's on lockdown, I imagine she was inundated if something did get out. Curious that someone would be motivated to anonymously dump a load of private pics but be so slow /unwilling to communicate with you about it?! This guy will be blacked out against venetian blinds and a voice changer in my documentary \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 1:22:56pm\par
 Teslaman: The Sheriffs are the top dogs in each local police department, so it's an association for all of them in the state. I laugh since Hannah has threatened me with going to the police on more than one occasion, lol. Even her ex BF did when I just warned him about a situation she created. Is that normal over there? They make it seem like if you trip into someone, it warrants going to the police, lmao. Over here you will be "that person" everyone can't stand in the neighborhood if you're bothering the cops that damn much, lol. Most of us actually try to resolve things ourselves, but that might have something to do with that pesky independence we love so much, haha. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 1:26:02pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah I guess they had their fun and left? I dunno, I just hope they come back! Hehe, yeah that's if he can ever be tracked down. It's a pretty good chance it's the guy though, since there were very few search results on what I found.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 1:49:03pm\par
spazzyjeff: Not sure it's reflective of any kind of national 'nanny state' mentality (we made our feelings on independence pretty clear last summer  - more just an individual scrabbling around for a tactic that will serve their own needs. To my shame I'm no legal mastermind, more interested in humanity than bueaucracy or something I suppose. Hannah... if you're reading this and you'd like to do an interview for my documentary... \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 3:01:09pm\par
 Teslaman: That's good to hear. Yeah most of us here were hoping for your win over there. Shame that it's just as divided as here though. That nanny state mentality probably just falls on that Remain side.  Which is the same here. People who love big government, most definitely did not vote for Trump, lol. Yeah, I loathe legalese. My only concern is freedom vs oppression, not politics, so I oppose any side that gets oppressive. Yeah I'd be amazed if she'd do an interview. It's more likely she'd try to prevent any story from happening, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 3:56:50pm\par
spazzyjeff: Yeah.... SJWs fighting a losing battle on both sides of the pond at the moment it seems. Real shame that  Got the.rar file now, thanks. Couple of bits in there were new to me. Are all the social media leads dead now then? Do you think you'll ever hear from her by email again?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 7:10:21pm\par
longtimefan27: I am a long time fan of Hannah, as my name might suggest. I thought this was a place for her fans, but as short a time as I've been here, I realise you're all a bit nuts and a bit more misogynistic. Basically what has happened here was a girl got into something that got out of control, because she was hot and it has ballooned for years. I feel incredibly sorry for Hannah that she attracted the kind of attention that won't let go, even when asked nicely. I acknowledge my own part in this - I searched for her videos and found this site. But really, let's give it up now..\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 7:56:40pm\par
 Teslaman: @spazzyjeff Well she still uses FB if that's what you mean, but obv she doesn't want people messaging her on there. Nah, I doubt I'll hear from her again. \par
@longtimefan27 That sounds like a very Hannah thing to say and quite frankly, I've suspected that you're tied to her in some fashion by the questions you've asked since showing up here. Near everything is laid out here and nothing she has done has been nice. She essentially kept me and everyone else on her hook in case she wanted to use me, then when I wouldn't tolerate her deception and manipulation anymore, the mask drops off and I get to see her true colors. There is absolutely nothing to feel sorry for with such a person.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 9:29:50pm\par
spazzyjeff: Fight!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 10:38:05pm\par
 Teslaman: Always is anymore. I hope everyone can see how ridiculous that was. They've been on since Feb 9th at least, but just now discover that the adoring fan days died with the words she uttered the other year. Gee, maybe the long ass page of text might have been some kind of indication, or the chat even? Nooo, magically after I drop some more pics and we have this discussion, it dawns on them! Oh the horrors manifest!  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 10:38:29pm\par
 Teslaman: Then you have the questions about where to find the old stuff, but literally zero effort on their part to pursue what they want. Everyone at least emails me about it, but mysteriously no such thing. They can't even work their PMs apparently, in classic Hannah style, lol. Also you have the question of who the new admin is. Gee, I can't imagine why they asked that, or why they were the only one seeming to care.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par

 Teslaman: Then enter the "misogynistic" comment, which has also only ever come from her. Typical 3rd wave feminist and improper use of the term. You see, they can ogle hunky wrestler men and barbarians on GoT, but don't you dare ogle a woman, you pig! lmao They take a perfectly natural attraction/lust/admiration and turn it into a feminist man hate fest, because they're jaded by some assholes from their past. Only proper betas who tow their line are now acceptable. Submit to their shaming tactics, or else! Need I go on? lol \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Mar 25, 10:44:08pm\par
 Teslaman: I've dealt with so many logic fails that I feel like I should be running defrag, chkdsk, or a memory test.  Ok, now back to what I was doing... \par

JustAnotherHanFan: @longtimefan27 is that you Hannah??\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 10:25:40am\par
spazzyjeff: Can't believe anyone thinks that bloody dress is black and blue.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 10:38:41am\par
spazzyjeff: Utter, utter madness.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 11:22:12am\par
spazzyjeff: It's absolutely white and gold. All day long.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 3:13:57pm\par
 Teslaman: @spazzyjeff Lol, yes that is exactly her perception in a nutshell. Obv I can't be 100% sure that was her or a friend, but the pattern of illogical behavior matches. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 4:27:35pm\par
 Teslaman: @JustAnotherHanFan They've deleted their chatango account now, just like another person I know who confirmed they're FB friends with her. Who funny enough, is back online now after being off for going on a month. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 4:43:55pm\par
anon3740: Sherlock Tes\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 5:03:19pm\par
 Teslaman: Haha, pretty much.  I'm really good at following those "confusing" time travel shows/movies too, lol. And I wrote all that last night after having been up for 30hrs, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 5:03:49pm\par
anon5681: all what?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 5:05:43pm\par
 Teslaman: Those 3 comments breaking down longtimefan's comment.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 5:14:21pm\par
 Teslaman: There's actually two versions of those comments too, since chatango lost my first one saying it was too long, then gave it back from the ether after I re-wrote it again, lol. I think some parts of the re-write were better. Like mentioning how some women dirty talk to each other about men in far more vulgar ways than even men do. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 6:08:17pm\par
spazzyjeff: Everyone's capable of vulgarity I guess, not convinced it's a a gender specific trait.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 6:14:17pm\par
 Teslaman: Indeed, but of course many women will deny it.  I've seen some admit it though. I saw a number of women speak up and call Trump's "grab them by the pussy" guy talk to be tame by comparison to their own girl talk, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 11:02:32pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh and let me translate the "won't let go" comment too. "I wish you'd just shutup and stop showing everyone how shit I acted". lol No, I've actually wished to close the site a number of times, but now after the things that were said about me, ohhhh how that just fuels my desire to keep it going and let everyone know. The thing that I never let go, is being treated badly.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 11:04:10pm\par
 Teslaman: Especially when that person admits very plainly that they never cared to begin with. Why care about someone you met online? You've never met, you don't know each other. Right? No, that's pretty fucked up actually.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 11:05:15pm\par
 Teslaman: Now I still manage to enjoy the new stuff and would love to see more, don't get me wrong, hot is still hot, but you guys seriously only still have the site and the new stuff because of my intolerance for being fucked with. Now with that whole bit she pulled on youtube, etc, that just makes me even more determined. As usual, she has the completely wrong view as to why I do things.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Mar 26, 11:29:45pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh and she's made it quite clear in our last 100+ email exchange that she still doesn't care or feel bad at all, so that also further fuels my determination to keep the site going. Now where were we before I got set off again? lol Oh yeah, pics. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Mar 27, 2:16:25am\par
 Teslaman: 20 more pics, from 2011, added to the gallery.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Mar 27, 12:58:30pm\par
spazzyjeff: She's beautiful\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Mar 27, 1:44:21pm\par
 Teslaman: Indeed she is! And just for the record, those are still all saved from the public. I've shared no private pics.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Mar 28, 7:44:22am\par
obsydian1981: woah new stills!? I thought she was gone from the internet forever. I guess once you're internet famous, always internet famous\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Mar 28, 1:56:02pm\par
spazzyjeff: And leaked by pewdiepie. Who would've thought!?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Mar 28, 1:59:46pm\par
 Teslaman: lol \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 29, 2:43:22pm\par
jaysquire: Hi, the video of her groping & playing with herself doesn't load anymore, any chance of a re-upload? I've seen most of her stuff over the years, shocked to only find this site today! It's absolutely made my day!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 29, 3:49:32pm\par
spazzyjeff: That you Hannah?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 29, 4:04:54pm\par
jaysquire: Nope, not hannah I'm affraid, any idea what her real name is Jeff? I've searched under Hannah hotel, hannah amateur, hannah Stuart, hannah Portman, no idea if either of those are her real name.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 29, 4:50:16pm\par
spazzyjeff: I'd be a touch careful throwing speculation about in a public chat room.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 29, 7:07:54pm\par
 Teslaman: Shit, would have deleted that sooner had I been on.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 29, 7:13:25pm\par
 Teslaman: The video is a standard html5 embed now. If you can't play that, then you're using something even older than I do and that's pretty bad, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Mar 29, 7:39:57pm\par
 Teslaman: And how do you guys manage to use broken emotes? lol Chat must be allowing input of phone/mobile emotes or something. Also, this chat is html5 too, so the video should certainly work for you too.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 2:07:11am\par
jaysquire: Oops, @Teslaman, didnt realise I wasn't allowed to write that or I wouldn't have done.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 2:08:13am\par
jaysquire: I'm trying to view it using my phone, any chance you could post a site rip for the pay site? That way I can download it?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 3:06:31am\par
 Teslaman: Ok cool, I understand that with the way online things are these days. Strange that the much more complex html5 chat would work, but not the simple video embed. Damn phones, lol.  Ah, nah I don't want to put a rip up of the paysite due to the (fruitless) work involved.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 3:36:23am\par
anon7962: Was that the only video on the paysite? It's the only one that comes up in the video section? The rest have no thumbnails. It's the only video I think that I haven't seen. Any chance you could be convinced to upload it somewhere? Pretty please?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 3:59:09am\par
 Teslaman: Oh we're talking about two different videos. There's the new one on the gallery page, then the example video on the paysite. The one on the paysite is a clip from one of Natasha's videos. That one should definitely work, as it's a google video embed.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:08:05am\par
 Teslaman: And yeah that's the only video on there since it's just meant as a mockup example. I could use the actual new video now, but haven't felt like creating new thumbnails and gifs, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:10:33am\par
anon7962: Definitely won't load for me, ive tried it like a dozen times now, any chance you could upload a downloadable link somewhere? Even if it's just a temporary thing on Megaupload or rapidshare etc, id really appreciate it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:30:39am\par
 Teslaman: See if the drive link works: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9C_-LaMbNUgTXF5OTlKWGp5czQ\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:33:16am\par
jaysquire: It does, thanks. I only just realised that it's not a video of hannah, I take it it's this girl natasha that you mentioned?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:34:32am\par
jaysquire: I only wanted to see it so much as I thought it was of hannah & would be the only video I have not yet seen of her that's been released. She really is stunning!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:34:59am\par
jaysquire: Thankyou for linking me to it though, much appreciated\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:35:37am\par
jaysquire: Are you still uploading new content to the site or is everything you have already online?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:35:46am\par
 Teslaman: Correct, the paysite one is Natasha. Ah ok, yeah I prob should label it as such since they do look a lot similar now that Hannah has filled out nicely, hehe.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:36:32am\par
 Teslaman: I was putting more of the public FB pics up, but that's on hold right now.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:40:40am\par
 Teslaman: Might not be putting more up at all actually, hard to say. I expected that all bridges were burned at this point, so I figured I'd add more, but then that changed.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:43:12am\par
jaysquire: It changed? How so? I read the whole story of what has happened... is there an update?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:48:29am\par
 Teslaman: Well, I'll just leave it at that for now since things get taken the wrong way too often anymore.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:53:55am\par
 Teslaman: So the video on the gallery page works fine then?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:54:55am\par
jaysquire: Ahhh ok. Fair enough. Well, hopefully one day there will be more material. The hannah videos and photos are in my opinion the best around. And she's just as attractive as she was when I first stumbled across her a decade ago, perhaps even more so.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:55:42am\par
jaysquire: Yes the newest video on the gallery page works fine, sorry for the confusion. \u-10179?\u-8694? \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:57:33am\par
jaysquire: Thanks for taking the time to reply to me & sorry to read about the rough time you have had with it all over the years.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 5:00:05am\par
 Teslaman: I would have to agree on that.  Oh ok cool, no worries. I'll prob replace the google embeds with direct html5 then. The google ones were always a pita anyways, lol. No problem and thanks for that. It went fine for years, or so I thought, but the last few have been like a meat grinder, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 5:17:25am\par
anon7962: I'll check back from time to time to see if there are any updates. You should put together a mailing list for her fans incase of any updates (just a thought)\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 5:17:37am\par
anon7962: Once again, nice speaking with you.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 5:33:53am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah normally that would indeed be a good idea, but in this case there are currently some people I'd prefer not to be getting updates, lol. Cheers, nice chatting with you too. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 5:37:04am\par
anon7962: Could always leave the certain people offrom the mailing list \u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 5:37:30am\par
anon7962: Off of *\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 5:52:56am\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, yeah, impossible to know who is who though.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 1:59:47pm\par
anon9366: Thank you sir\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 2:44:43pm\par
 Teslaman: Sure thing.  Btw, in case anyone is trying, my email is completely down right now and you'll get a bounce back.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 4:39:37pm\par
spazzyjeff: Hannah's attack drones attacking the servers again, huh.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Mar 30, 11:17:32pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol, nah looks like just a crash this time. It's all good now, but that was some sucky timing! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 31, 4:57:20am\par
 Teslaman: Sweet mercy! https://xhamster.com/movies/7471347/orgasmic_bouncing_boobs_fucked_hard_by_young_bf.html and this is why I love amateur stuff. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 31, 5:32:50am\par
 Teslaman: Oh and thanks to whoever came here off the mobile xhamster referral, lol. Wouldn't have seen that one otherwise. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Mar 31, 5:46:54am\par
 Teslaman: @anon7962 Hmm, you know...that came off wrong too actually, lol. It's not that I don't want some people knowing, I'd just currently prefer to make them work at it, ha.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Apr 1, 6:59:19am\par
smee: did we get more stuff from her?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Apr 1, 7:12:52am\par

Sat Apr 1, 7:55:56pm\par
innuendo: Hi...any news about Hannah?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Apr 1, 8:14:02pm\par
spazzyjeff: She has been extradited to Peru.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 2, 12:44:37am\par
 Teslaman: @sally Hi sally...wait, did a chick actually post as a chick, or are you one of those creepy dudes? haha @innuendo Nope. @spazzyjeff Lol, so random, why Peru? How about the US instead so she can actually meet my ass, haha. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 2, 12:56:25am\par
 Teslaman: \par
\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 2, 9:48:14am\par
spazzyjeff: Fake news.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 2, 10:38:10am\par
 Teslaman: Ah, so auditioning for HuffPo or CNN? \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 3, 10:08:18am\par
anon4039: What are the chances of new content at this point?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 3, 10:26:03am\par
 Teslaman: Well, the leaker said they had a lot more. I'd very much like to see the videos he mentioned, but it's anybody's guess if that will happen.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 3, 11:20:43am\par
spazzyjeff: He's waiting to hear back from the Peruvian ambassador on a FOI request.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 3, 4:42:03pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol, well I know what my birthday wish will be this year, ha!  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 3, 7:14:29pm\par
spazzyjeff: I've asked for a new Hammer of Thor. Plus rollerskates.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Apr 4, 8:24:42am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah, so annoying when Vision keeps borrowing it while at the Galactic roller rink to impress the ladies.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Apr 5, 12:51:45am\par
 Teslaman: Nice to have Prison Break back again, but it made me think of something that I just can't resist saying. It will trigger some folks. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Apr 5, 12:53:13am\par
 Teslaman: I unapologetically don't like Mormons, or Jehovah's Witness (does anyone? lol), or Luciferians and Satanists, or Muslims either. Practice what you like, but I also don't have to like you. Only idiots make being anti-Islam about race and only the ignorant refuse to admit that it's inherently a fucked religion with a pedo prophet.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Apr 5, 12:53:30am\par
 Teslaman: I know, I know, in the "free" UK or Germany, that kinda talk gets you arrested and put in prison with the large Muslim population, where you get beaten to shit or killed. Bunch of cucks running the place. Oh and you don't see Christians murdering people over "Piss Christ", but Charlie Hebdo incites Jihad. That is all, back to your regularly scheduled porn.  Aloha Snackbar!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Apr 6, 2:17:50am\par
 Teslaman: And FYI, this is why I watch almost zero TV anymore. Sick of the fucking propaganda, which was actually officially legalized here a few years back when they killed the laws preventing it (Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act). I know education is a sin these days, but I can't help it. lol \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 9, 1:23:21am\par
anon7386: loving the new images! shame theres not more videos. a new sex one would be the cherry topper!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 9, 1:55:04am\par
 Teslaman: Agreed, that's at the top of my Birthday Wish List, lol. Hopefully with icing on the cake this time too. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 9, 5:36:00am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Creampie would be nice too.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 9, 6:08:14am\par
 Teslaman:   MTSA (Making Twinkie Straight Again) lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 9, 10:19:47pm\par
 Teslaman: Current reflective thought: It's funny how there are some quite large cultural differences between Brits and Americans that you would never even think existed until you're smacked in the face with them.  It's literally like a Star Trek episode where something you deem perfectly normal, sends the aliens off on a killing rage out of offense, lol.  I've never actually mentioned this, despite having had multiple "WTF?" looks on my face. So keep that in mind folks, it might save you some needless rage next time.  Which reminds me...poor Andy, that dude never saw it coming either, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 10, 6:13:13pm\par
 Teslaman:  Ahhh Monday.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Apr 11, 9:59:44pm\par
 Teslaman: @jaysquire Scratch that, nothing has changed after all. I thought about waiting to say that, give it more time, but I've learned by now that there's no point in waiting around. Not going to be caught up in that aggravation again.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Apr 13, 10:51:51am\par
 Teslaman: Added a tributes gallery. \par

Thu Apr 13, 2:41:27pm\par
 Teslaman: @HAnonmin LOL! No homo!  Yeah only reason I know of her is because of AJ, ha. All these UK/Brit leaks...I think they're trying to give a hint to our fav leaker, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Apr 13, 6:21:53pm\par

 Teslaman: Top 10 search results:  Sorry, #9 isn't here.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Apr 14, 6:33:09pm\par
 Teslaman: The bulk of the main page is now moved to the About page. It makes more sense for it to be there and it lets me keep the main page about what matters most to me, Tits and Education.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Apr 15, 2:34:33am\par
 Teslaman: Here's an idea for all of you who have read everything on here, lets hear what you would personally require in order to feel like you've been properly made up to for everything. Personally, I think some things you just can't ever fully make up for, but it would certainly require no small gesture to get there. But what say you? \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 16, 4:28:01pm\par
anon1314: Do you mean what hannah would hanve to do to make up for all the bs?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Apr 16, 4:32:56pm\par
 Teslaman: Yes\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 17, 2:22:13am\par
jaseface: Video of her on all fours, looking into the camera. She spanks herself hard, causing her tits to jiggle. After each spank she looks into the camera and says "I'm sorry Tesla".\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 17, 3:02:36am\par
 Teslaman: Oooo nice! Thanks  Safe assumption that she's nude for that? So that would be 1 vote for nudes/apology video, anyone else?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 17, 3:06:10am\par
jaseface: Of course!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 17, 6:29:19am\par
anon0690: Orgasm video\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 17, 2:02:47pm\par
 Teslaman: Another good one, come on all you regular lurkers, lets hear it!  So far we're thinking alike on this, but what about anything non-sexual? Are there any things that someone thinks could actually measure up?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 17, 2:32:34pm\par
Jasefaces: Well, she could pay you for your work.. I'm not sure what else there is - I think we're all here to look at her tits, not form a lasting relationship with her!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 17, 3:03:29pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah, for me that doesn't cut it either, far too impersonal to measure up. I'm looking for hypothetically though, if you had gone through all that and had become more friendly with some chick. Oh, well my expectation is to basically part ways afterwards, the notion of resuming any kind of friendship would be unexpected and frankly, currently unwanted. I mean, that could happen, but it'd have to be one hell of a satisfactory makeup where she showed copious initiative and remorse. Which is very unlikely, given how she can't even return a sincere email when she says she will, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Apr 18, 6:17:00pm\par
themunted: Is there anything that could be seen as fair game? Personally I'd love a full on gratuitous cleavage photo. That or a big great dirty facial \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Apr 18, 10:09:58pm\par
 Teslaman: Well, it's all fair game to me, lol. I'm mainly curious to see if we're thinking alike on this, which so far we are.  Also curious to see if anyone comes up with something that I hadn't thought of. I think a good first step would be that picture I had asked for before, as it's incredibly tame by comparison to what's on here now, lol.  At least that would show an effort, since sadly I haven't seen a single thing yet that changes my mind in the least.  \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 24, 10:58:22am\par
anon320: It was on this site but now I can't find it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 24, 11:17:35am\par
anon320: If anyone knows Hannah's twitter, could you let me know it, please.\par
Many thanks.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 24, 12:27:58pm\par

anon320: Umm, yes, her twitter was on this site.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Apr 24, 7:32:04pm\par
 Teslaman: Bullshit. I've never posted, or allowed it here since it includes her personal info.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Apr 25, 1:24:56am\par
 Teslaman: Btw, similar claims have been mentioned to me privately, but I've held my tongue since I don't know if the claims are even true. But I'll just say that I only see two reasons to make such claims. One, to test me. Two, someone wants to keep driving a wedge of mistrust by generating lies. I'm not considering mistaken memory as an option, since I see a pattern of intent here. Whichever it is, I'm no longer going to let this go unmentioned, since it feels like some form of manipulation.\par

Tue Apr 25, 2:14:14pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol, well, I gotta correct it so it doesn't cause the 2nd one. If it's the first one, then I just wanted to point out that I'm not blind. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Apr 26, 11:22:30pm\par
 Teslaman: You know, it's a sure sign that a chick has successfully teased the fuck outta you, when even after having said so much shit about you, she can still turn you on like crazy. lol Anyone still willing to perform a lobotomy these days? lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par

anon5304: hi is hannah gonna do new stuff?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Apr 27, 3:54:45pm\par
 Teslaman: No, never gunna happen. Best you can hope for is a leak like in December. Of course, no doubt she still believes that I'm trying to get her to come back, ffs.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon May 1, 7:31:33pm\par
 Teslaman: So apparently I just use Hannah in order to talk to people online.  In truth, I'm so massively introverted that I have a hard enough time even speaking with friends and not just vanishing from the earth! Probably partly why I tend to talk a lot when I do actually talk. I didn't even have a chat on here for the longest time after the last blowout with her, since I really wasn't in the mood to deal with anyone, but people were just emailing me instead. So this is just easier. If anything, I know that I tend to drive people away from chatting when I go off on other topics, lol. When I do want to actually engage with people, I go on youtube or comment sections for the videos and articles that get me all riled up.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon May 1, 7:32:30pm\par
 Teslaman: Not that saying any of this actually matters. I just needed to vent about it, because that really bugged me, as does most of the shit things she says.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue May 2, 9:18:46am\par
obsydian1981: man hannah is still fine as hell, but the latest pictures you shared makes her seem strangely normal. i guess when its just porn videos you never think about how the person in the video has a normal life, probably has a job, hangs out with friends, goes and sees movies...but these videos make it seem weird that like decades later we're still trawling the internet for images of her thinking back to a time when she could have been 17 or so. The internet is weird man.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue May 2, 4:59:19pm\par
 Teslaman: Well there's one positive thing to come of it then, humanizing her a bit. Might not seem so weird after it settles a bit.  That's pretty normal in amateur porn really, people tend to want that more personal touch where it's not just about rubbing one out, lol. Most of the old regulars were like that, where it was quite the treat to have Hannah chatting about her day and such. I miss those days, back when she had a healthy, normal attitude about all of this. Which is probably why the old regulars are gone now, since knowing what she's like now is a total turnoff. I must admit, it was a turnoff for me too. Now I just don't think about it and focus only on that hot bod of hers. Which is a bit funny and sad, seeing as how she'd rather be seen as more than just a piece of meat.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue May 2, 5:15:32pm\par
 Teslaman: Well sorry babe, you actually had that when your personality was just as lovely as your bod. I was really hoping we could get back to the way things were, but she has just gotten too venomous, seeing everything through warped, judgmental feminazi eyes now. It's totally lost on her that if you're a nasty person towards people you've made judgments about, then those people aren't going to care one bit about you and will just focus on looks. So she equates that to being my view of all women, but obviously that applies only to certain people and is true for both men and women. Anyways, there I went on a long explanation again, lol. Good comment obsydian! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue May 2, 6:17:54pm\par
 Teslaman: And if you want to bitch about men's view of women, it's not the western men you should ever be focusing on! Even the chicks we treat as nothing more than sex objects are still treated massively better than most eastern women! Besides, women do that to men too, it's natural and no big deal. If you want to see some vile treatment of women, then look to the east! But as usual, 3rd wave feminists would rather invent things to fight here, turning men against them and causing the regression that they seek to prevent.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri May 5, 12:45:01pm\par
 Teslaman:  Lol to whoever uploaded this.  Hey, you know what they say: "Don't stick your dick in crazy!", which rules out the majority of women these days.  But, your hand never bitches, knows just what you like, doesn't drain your wallet and leaves you free to do as you please. Worth the trade-off IMO.  \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon May 8, 6:27:06pm\par
 Teslaman: Holy traffic spike Batman! lol Where did that come from? @anon0252 That would be Nikola Tesla.  Seems Tesla Motors is using it now for their mascot, but I'm not really fond of them. I've been using it, and a longer variation, since 1999/2000. It's cool to see more people using it now, since back then I never found anyone else using it and most people had no idea who he was. \par

Tue May 9, 1:21:11am\par
 Teslaman: Ahhhh, hello redditors! lol \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu May 11, 11:11:34pm\par
 Teslaman: You know, I just gotta say, it's so crazy unbelievable when multiple people have the nerve to ask you for favors after they've screwed you over. Then you ask for something in return and they call it blackmail, lol. Even your highly overbearing UK laws don't consider that bm. In case it isn't clear yet, I'm done wasting my time on such people and that's never going to change unless they do, which I expect will never happen. I'll never see things your way, as your way fundamentally disgusts me and anyone else I know. \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon May 15, 7:59:19pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol, pretty much.  That's apparently what she meant before by having told me repeatedly that she might still do it. No joke, that was essentially her excuse.\par

Wed May 17, 9:16:17pm\par
 Teslaman: As you can see from the new link up top, my old b-n-a site is back and better than ever.  Yeah I know, "Thought you were getting out of running these sites?". Well, my replacement plans have gone tits up and apparently I'm stuck with this site like a STD, soooo...might as well! lol \par

Sat May 20, 9:51:51pm\par
 Teslaman: Yep, it's done and I'm getting the content added. Although I'm sure the code tweaking will continue, especially on the file browsing system. My past limitations of needing to use filehosts are gone now and I'm keeping the design simple/spartan, so it's a lot easier to add the Gigs of content.  All thanks to my battling it out with Hannah, lol. "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger." \par

Sun June 11, 3:48:15pm\par
 Teslaman: @anon2468 I agree completely. I was even warned about her from the beginning and my instincts were telling me not to get involved, but I didn't really want to believe it, plus she acted so nice that I eventually gave it a shot. So I really hate how this all turned out. It's hard to see past all of it now to the same awesome amateur, but I manage. \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri June 16, 7:59:17pm\par
 Teslaman: Cheers for sharing.  Ohhh man, I've heard a hilarious story about her reaction to them, but I probably shouldn't say. That said, I would hope that she secretly likes them.  I know I sure would think it's hot to see chicks getting off over me. After all, it's quite flattering. Which is probably why feminazis hate it, since they're usually so ugly (inside and out) that no sane man is aroused by them, lol. \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat June 17, 12:23:36am\par
 Teslaman: Huh, where did you get that from? In the chat with the leaker, they said, and I quote: "Yeah do what you like mate. They your nudies now". That was in response to me asking, "So you want me to post these too, or?" I'll have a re-read over everything they said to me, but I'm pretty damn sure they never asked me to not post them elsewhere.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat June 17, 12:52:52am\par
 Teslaman: Yep, confirmed, they never said that to me, so I don't know where on earth you got that from. Closest comment was the leaker saying: "She knows someone is posting her fb pics on xhamster too as she accused me a few times so be careful. If its anyone on here just saying." But that's certainly not saying not to do it and wasn't even directed at me. If you've read the chat, then you know I was perfectly willing to be accommodating.\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue June 20, 5:42:29am\par
 Teslaman: @anon7021 He also wouldn't have posted them publicly if he cared about that, lol. Curious comment though. I'd just have to bring back the secret private site again if someone wanted to go that route. That worked fine for years. But you certainly can't expect random visitors/fans not to spread them. Half the time they don't even read the text around the links, lol. \par

Thu July 6, 6:55:30pm\par
anon4778: might want to tack that onto the "about" section somewhere, since instead it says you have proof she WAS legal :/\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu July 6, 7:05:27pm\par
anon4089: nevermind I reread it (i'm sure chat will give me a new "anon" number but same guy as last two anons) and I had just misinterpreted which side of the 'debate' you were settling. I thought you were saying that she used the claim at one point but it was a lie, etc. Plus when someone says "and here's proof" I thought it would be to prove she WAS legal. Anyhow, sorry for the misunderstanding!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu July 6, 8:09:09pm\par
 Teslaman: Ah no worries.  Yeah, that part was written back when I removed everything, so it had the context, but now I can see how that could be confusing. I'll change the wording a bit to make it more clear.\par

Sat July 8, 6:29:26am\par

 Teslaman: @anon4305 Btw, I'm definitely not Luke, lol. A few people have thought that though. Can't say I fit into any one group either. Like I align the most with Libertarians, but I don't really consider myself one due to their views on borders and such.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun July 16, 11:11:31am\par
 Teslaman: I linked the Redpill documentary for Hannah and her ilk's benefit, since it shows how even a closed minded feminist can have their eyes opened. In fact, a number of the embeds are pointed at her/them.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun July 16, 11:27:20am\par
 Teslaman: I'm also much closer to a MRA than a MGTOW. I very much understand the view of the MGTOWs, being fed up with these whacked out women all over the place, but I'm a hopeless romantic, I'll never give up on ALL women, lol. Hannah doesn't get me either though. She thinks this treatment of her is how I view all women, when really, it's just how I treat anyone who does what she has done. If I was a chick and she was a dude, it'd be leaked dick pics on here, lmao!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon July 17, 8:15:11pm\par

 Teslaman: Nah, Natasha is an all American Southern girl. Yep, search for "TashaSky" or "Tasha Sky". Here's one: https://xhamster.com/movies/291001/webcam_cutie_tasha_sky_with_sound_9.html No doubt some messy memories, lol! \par

Fri Aug 4, 7:01:22pm\par
 Teslaman: That's news to me. j/k  But really, haven't we all? lol Seriously though, to me, achievements are more of a personal thing. One person's achievement is another person's waste of time, lol. Some people think winning an Oscar is a grand achievement, but quite a few people couldn't care less. Like, my name was put in some wall plaque downtown, but that kind of thing matters so little to me that I can't even tell you right now what it was for, haha. Or like how Hitler, Stalin, Mao accomplished so much with theirs that they went down in history and still all have followers today! Of course, most of us are glad not to aspire to their goals, lol. As long as you accomplish what is important to you in life, that's really all that matters. \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Aug 13, 4:07:26am\par
 Teslaman: Nope, but sorry, I'm not giving that out. The list of fakes is on the About page though, second section down. I get wanting to know, since I like knowing the chicks names too and not having them be some random unknown. Not to mention personalizing it a bit by their social media and pics. Which reminds me, it was pretty damn insulting when Hannah accused me of being a stalker just because she knows I do that! Also pretty damn funny! Newsflash: Guys don't think like girls, lol. I do that with any chick I can find info on! Granted, you want to get some more than others, especially if you've gotten to know them at all. Anyways, didn't intend to make that long, but damn that has been bugging me! She sure knows how to repeatedly offend someone, lol. And she wonders why we're on bad terms now, sheesh. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 15, 7:00:42pm\par
anon3304: @Teslaman \par
Awesome site. I found it a while back and I've been lurking since. \par
I love the new releases, Hannah is someone I've kept coming back to over the years. She never disappoints. \par
\par
A few weeks back I set aside an afternoon and did some detective work. I've since tracked her down on FB (it's definitely her, I found friends from some linked content etc.) I'll not give out the surname here, but I was just so happy to have finally found her that I wanted to share it.\par
I hope to god some new content comes out at some point and I'm sure you'll get it first. \par
Keep up the good work. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 16, 12:47:46am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah her stuff never gets old! Well frankly, I was just thinking the other day how this site is only still here because she essentially prefers that over actually making amends with me, lol. I was actually hoping to shut it down after everything, but her approach inspires the exact opposite reaction from me. I'm not sure it's possible to find two people more stubborn and pit them against each other, lol!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 16, 12:54:21am\par
 Teslaman: Ah ok, feel free to get in touch privately too if you want to discuss any of that. Thanks for not posting it here too. I get blamed enough already for other guys doing that, lol. I hear ya, I hope so too! It really depends on the person sharing it though. If they want it kept private, then I won't be posting it on here. I know that pisses off some dudes, but if for no other reason, why shoot yourself in the foot? From what one guy said on here earlier, it seems like the guys who do have stuff, have been told by someone (gee I wonder who) that I'll betray them. Even when one person lied about me, they still shared some info with me, so I wasn't about to sell them out. Even with an alleged carrot being dangled in front of me. To me, it was offensive to even think that I would, but ah well.\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 17, 12:30:46pm\par
anon4578: thanks actually i saw her first then went and found your site. I was memorized by her videos years back. especially the solo dancing videos\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 17, 6:19:41pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah her old videos are what I like, solo and real sex without all the porno-style crap that saturates everything now, even the amateur stuff. An updated version of those videos would be awesome! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 17, 6:34:41pm\par
 Teslaman: Such a shame the way things have gone though, for several reasons, but kinda inevitable when that person has vilified you in their mind from the very beginning. I'm "bad" for even having made a fansite! Just blows my mind. Can you imagine if say...Pamela Anderson came along and told the uber fan that ran a fansite of her, that they were bad for having done so? And not just a little bad, no, compared to the lowest form of creep possible! Talk about soul crushing! Now imagine she waited years to do that too, the whole time acting like things were fine and claiming to be on friendly terms. To me, that's just mega villain level of stuff, but hey, what do I know.  \par

Mon Aug 21, 12:42:09pm\par
 Teslaman: I don't believe she never has, just isn't the type, but I can't say for certain. There was some woman impersonating her with a swinger service years ago, but I got that sorted. Don't think I even ever told her about that one. All I know is, one person recently claimed that I told them she was one when I hadn't and she got pretty offended. Although, I also suspect that person was her and the whole thing was staged, lol. Too many odd things and coincidences.  \par

anon9271: What's the story with the new vid? Did she send that to u? Will she do more?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Aug 21, 9:22:51pm\par
 Teslaman: No, the new pics/vid were a leak by some anon. She won't be coming back, except maybe to take petty shots at me, lol. Much more info is on the About page.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 6:18:23am\par
anon0301: Just read it all, do u think there's a chance he'll provide more pics? He made out that he had loads more. It's a shame he can't trust u with the other vids, I can say for me at least I've got no intention of sharing them across the web, I'm pretty sure anyone who is still coming here isn't interested in spreading her further than themselves. I still find it unusual that she didn't take the chance to make a few quid out of this....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 6:20:13am\par
anon0301: ...The proper fans are here because they and they alone want to see her. I get the mistrust cuz u see it all over the net, guys sharing pics of ex's etc. I can say for myself I've had pics of girlfriends and I'd never give them out, but then again this would never exist but for that. At the same time it kind of feels like she wanted it to happen so I don't think it's the same situation. The situation with u and her sounds complicated and I've followed it from the beginning. What interests me about this is how a woman can take hold over men so easily, why am I still looking, why do I still want her after so long, why would I still try as u have. I guess men are just programmed that way lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 6:20:45am\par
anon0301: ......I can only live in hope that this guy shares what he's afraid to put on rather than the alternative which would be her making a private Tumblr account or similar, call it nothing to do with 'Hannah' and most people other than fans wouldn't pay it any attention. I mean anyone too young to have been round in the beginning probably wouldnt even put the 2 together. And to be honest I think if all I ever saw was up to date stuff I probably wouldn't care as much.....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 6:21:22am\par
anon0301: ...Don't get me wrong she's still hot but not to the same extent that her videos and pics would captivate the world that's for sure! I think it would mainly be massive fans like myself that would still show the same interest and as I mentioned before I have no intention of sharing anything (mainly cuz I'm too lazy lol) but I can see that from your experience with this whole thing it's probably made u feel very differently about her.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 6:21:50am\par
anon0301: ...I think the point is she's one of the most famous girls that was ever on the net but now she's just any woman compared to then and the interest is only for those that still care and have no intention of making money or spreading material. I'm pretty sure she reads this stuff, I imagine it's a massive confidence boost and easy to get a kick out of. So I just wanna say that for me she is still the sexiest woman I've ever seen and I can only hope that she realises most people still around are fans & it would be nice just to show that appreciation back, even if just to explain why and say thanks for still caring and goodbye etc.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 6:50:52am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Very nicely put, @anon0301\par

JustAnotherHanFan: I hope she reads it at least.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 7:11:23am\par
 Teslaman: At this point I'm guessing the leaker won't be back. Seems like he just wanted to get back at her for something and now that he has done that, we won't see anymore. I'm actually surprised he hasn't asked me to take them down. In this situation, he's the only one who can make that request to me. I can see why he wouldn't trust me though, since I know people are making up stuff behind the scenes. Which is why I added the section laying out my position on sharing things. But nah, generally people want to share stuff and if it's in the public domain, then it's considered a free for all. "Sharing is caring" and all that. Private is another matter though and depends on the situation or person. Like if I promise to keep them private, then I will.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 7:14:09am\par
 Teslaman: The only exception for me is in a relationship where I am betrayed, like with my ex. In that case, any promises were nullified by their betrayal. I won't be kept to promises to someone who was that close, who decides to stick a knife in your back and twist it up into your heart for the finish. Gloves are off at that point. I won't be walked on. Obviously though, Hannah could never qualify for that exception.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 7:40:36am\par
 Teslaman: Indeed man, it became quite the complicated situation. Funny enough, all I wanted was for her to trust me, because I could tell from the very beginning that she didn't. Even though I kept plenty of things private from day one. Yet she just quickly trusted another guy she met through me on the site chat! That put me at a distance with her, I didn't want to get involved with someone who was clearly judging me differently from others. I thought we actually got somewhere finally though and yep, despite my better judgment, she absolutely sucked me in with that feminine charm of hers.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 7:41:26am\par
 Teslaman: Indeed men are just programmed that way, but sadly it's not something she understands. I'm not a trusting person either though, like at all, lol. She knows why too, which I'm considering adding on here since it's pertinent and I don't think she believes me. It is the entire driving force of why I've reacted this way. Making it public gives it the proper weight, even though I'd really rather not.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 7:59:46am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah, if I was to believe her, then she wouldn't be doing anything private either. My instincts tell me that these new nudes were simply a case of her desperately putting herself out there to guys on dating sites during a breakup period. Yeah in other words, "Teen" is the most popular with guys. Once you're not a teen anymore, your popularity drops and only mature guys still appreciate you. I still find her plenty attractive, more so now in some ways. But given everything that's happened, it's just purely physical to me now. That could change again of course, but she has so far done nothing good to earn that back. Ah well.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 8:35:21am\par
 Teslaman: Yep, she thought, or still thinks, that I hate her now. I really don't. People that I hate, I want nothing to do with ever again. If I hate you, I won't speak to you ever again for the rest of my life and I'll be wishing you dead, lol. So I wouldn't be running this site if I hated her. Again it goes back to my past and how I won't ever back down when someone has wronged me. I'm also kinda OCD about opening people's eyes, lol. Yeah she, or at least a friend, no doubt still reads the chat every now and then. I agree and thank you for saying all of that! It would be perfect to make amends and end it for everyone on a nice note like that. And no, I'm not anon0301! Seriously, that will be thought, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 8:05:54pm\par
anon1615: Well I thought that the comment he made about 'not sure if he was the only one she sent them to' sounded like there was more to it. Please correct me if I'm wrong and not understood, but why would he not be sure if he's the only person she sent them to? I mean some of them would ONLY be sent to him.....surely. So why would anyone else have the same pics? Plus why would the other vids or pics give him away when the ones he already sent would! If I'd taken a picture of myself nude I'm pretty sure I'd remember who I sent it to. And on another note if he's getting back at her why would he be bothered what he sent. Just seemed strange, what do you think Teslaman?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 9:07:30pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah I think he just assumed that since she sent them to him, some guy she has never met, that she probably sent them to other guys too. We can't really know if he was telling the truth about the videos that would give him away. Since he included a fake masturbation video, that makes me question if it was just hype. Maybe he does and he just did that because he felt bad about mentioning them. I thought it was all a bit odd too, how he didn't stick around or engage. He just lurked for a bit after, then vanished.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 9:07:59pm\par
 Teslaman: On remembering, yeah but we're guys, lol. I kid you not, the chick from that hyped up "revenge porn" case over there actually said she didn't even remember taking some of them! Hannah also told me she couldn't even remember what she said to me! I don't know why she'd lie about that, but either way that's so messed up. To say you don't even remember what you said just last year in a friendship ending argument?! Wow. Her words are forever seared into my brain!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 9:09:57pm\par
 Teslaman: He would be bothered because of those new crazy laws. Anything that was obviously only sent to him, would easily nail him. She would do it too. He probably held back certain pics too, ones he knew she took live during any chat. I bet she planned for most of them, due to her schedule. So those could be sent to anyone, since that's what chicks like to do. Especially ones as self-conscious as she is. Certain people that I've been suspicious of were also quite interested in who he was.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 22, 9:40:39pm\par
 Teslaman: I mean, you could be right, since that fits the standard thing chicks do these days. I just really doubt it in her case. Her instagram must have had a random alias though. Here's what I know though. Someone tells me she has a badoo account. To their surprise, I find it within minutes, lol. I knew she was in a relationship though, so I did some digging and saw they had split and she was hungrily on the prowl. Later that person tells me she's not on badoo anymore. I check again and yep, she got back together with the guy. The split was during April, when the new nudes are timestamped. So that's what I'm going by. The leaker could have been pissed with that if she lied about the situation, then just dropped him cold when she got back with her guy. In my experience with her, that is totally what I would expect from her.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 8:20:17pm\par
anon9870: The other is what I said earlier about making money from it. The biggest mistake to me is that over the years I've seen her image used on all sorts of pages with various names and contexts. Once u put it online.....its part of the world's library and is always inexistance. That being said the only thing you can do is control it and monetize it. It seems to have been left to grow and evolve. There are girls online now that have private accounts on sites like Tumblr etc and yes they could have media shared and spread but u don't really see it. The people who pay to be involved in general don't share them but pay to have that access. I'm not an expert on law and especially not www. Laws but I guess u copyright your images etc & that stops these things...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 8:32:58pm\par
anon9870: ....so the smart thing would have been get involved get control and make it work for herself. There's no going back from it going live. It's like somebody's wig falling off and them saying, pretend u didn't see that, it's done. She could have made the best of a bad situation (that's assuming she regrets it) maybe 3 or 4 years of content and exposure followed by a slowing of interest, hunger and ultimately care. There are cams girls that come along and they're the hottest thing ever, everybody wants to see them. They have a good run and then...they just kind of drop down the list.....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 8:45:27pm\par
anon9870: ......i guess I'm just saying that to me her best option would have been as described. Although I'm not forgetting age! Would I have the wisdom to have thought like that at such a young age? Was it just a different internet Then? I think it's become a more civilised place in some ways. Less wild west, more moderated and capitalistic. So much choice avalible that it doesn't have the same draw. It's been normalised to the point where little is of shock or note. Maybe I'm wrong but it's just some observations in my experience.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 8:46:45pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah she only ever showed monetizing interest back in 2009 with the paysite and all. Well, tumblr is tumblr, lol. The good stuff always gets out though. It's like with the celebrity leaks, that stuff stays private for years, but once the value of hoarding it is gone, people inevitably dump it. If you want to go that route, then you have to be very selective and not just trust anyone who will pay. But nah, copyrighting your images doesn't stop anything. Look how well that has worked for the entertainment industry, lol. Yeah, although popular cam girls have their stuff immortalized in archives by dudes on forums and torrents too. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 8:52:54pm\par
anon9870: I hear what ya saying, and you're right, it's still out There, but you have to want to find it if that makes sense. I'm not saying I'd be happy with that but then again I haven't made videos and had any interest in putting myself online like that whereas it seems she did......plus I don't look like her lol. But honestly I can think of girls online that had their stuff on sites of their own and where very much everywhere and now they're rarely things I see. They're there but just not everywhere and I'm sure they did ok from it and good luck to them\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 8:54:06pm\par
 Teslaman: When I was going to do the paysite with her, I was actually wanting to verify everyone that joined, in order to cut down on that sort of thing. But really, you can only do so much and eventually someone is going to be the loose cannon that blows it all wide open. Yeah it might have that perception, but the more money and control gets involved, the more extreme the response gets. People get pretty put off by others trying to dictate what you can and can't do with things you just put out there. It actually entices people to work at spreading it, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 8:58:59pm\par
anon9870: Yeah I guess I know ya right ultimately. But it's really interesting to try and put yourself in that position. I mean maybe I'm wrong you can probably tell me better than anyone but it seemed like she was pretty famous for a while. And it's in the history of the internet I guess. It's the old fame at a young age, what it does to you and how u deal with it and in this case for something that probably isn't what you'd choose\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:01:44pm\par
anon9870: Maybe it's just cuz I'm a massive fan and I'm looking through rose tinted glasses but I think she could be in a really good financial position now with all that behind her if she'd have made better choices. But i don't have a clue what is or was in her mind about it all\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:02:24pm\par
 Teslaman: Heh, indeed! She just got away from putting herself out there that way and turned to other things, like whatever instagram she had that the leaker mentioned. But, even that got out due to her popularity. Like heather deepthroat. She has been out of the game for ages too, but her stuff still makes the rounds regularly. Girls that fade off, just really weren't that popular tbh. Eventually the popular ones end up on those vintage sites, because being popular is truly timeless.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:06:56pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh I totally agree on that. She could be sitting pretty now and it'd be a win-win situation. But really, she cares too much what other people think and she lets that control her options.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:11:12pm\par
anon9870: I think ultimately im glad that she just looks like it's not really effected her and she's just getting on with life. I don't know what up and downs she's had and what may have been the repercussions from it all but she seems ok. You obviously know and have a lot more to make an opinion but from the outside it's like something stupid she did and it could have effected her badly. But like I say you might be thinking....oh no she's evil etc and she doesn't care. I only know a girl in a video and some pictures, you know the person.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:13:29pm\par
anon9870: I just think if ya sitting on the money most people would just say.... good on ya, nobody got harmed and you've done ok for yourself, who are the real mugs!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:22:40pm\par
 Teslaman: And yeah, she did really want to do that stuff actually. She was planning to do pro shoots with companies and whatnot, but like I mentioned, others negative opinions pressured her to do otherwise. Oh indeed, I would say that sums it up well. It's a much different story behind the scenes. Even I wouldn't say she's pure evil though. She just very judgmental and treats those people very badly that she looks down on. Basically she has a good heart, but has gotten lost in the darkness. I sincerely hope she can come out of that and see how she has really hurt people who aren't the bad people she thinks they are.\par

anon9870: I mean I'm just an average middle of the road salary guy but if I'm willing to pay \'a310 for something there must be guys out there that the equivalent would be \'a31000's. Maybe u know better than me but some of these girls must make private deals with people for stuff. They must get offers that are hard to turn down\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:29:05pm\par
anon9870: I think even more so as I got older I'd be thinking what the hell......a new kitchen for 10mins work lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:32:21pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, absolutely. She has had very large offers, but turned them down. The problem with the money guys is that they are impersonal and treat you like a thing to be bought. For people like her and I, that's such a turnoff that we refuse. That's one of her qualities that got me to like her on a personal level.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:36:34pm\par
anon9870: I can see why that would draw u more toward her. Cuz that's gotta be hard to turn down when it's there. Easy to say u would when you've never been in that position but much more difficult in reality. Maybe u can't say but out of interest did u hear of any offers that were made?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:43:29pm\par
anon9870: And what's the level of interest these days? It's probably much more than I think as it's hard to fully imagine the enormity of the internet sometimes. I just don't get why she wouldn't just come on her and say.....FUCK OFF....in a nice way and I for one would go.....ok, fair enough lol But maybe I'm underestimating the internet again and the access that millions of nut jobs have to it. I guess there are people out there like Lloyd from dumb & dumber.....'so you're telling me there's a chance'\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:44:54pm\par
anon9870: That's not gonna mean a lot unless you've watched dumb & dumber too many times lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:47:28pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah it was more that we shared that in common and those kind of qualities are hard to find these days. Things like that is also why she managed to do so much damage to me. It makes the betrayal that much worse. Anyways, yeah the offers always came through me since they didn't know how to contact her. They were big offers, from all kinds of guys and even a woman. The rich types, the independent site owners and ever porn industry guys.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:49:24pm\par
anon9870: Are u talking life changing money? Just interests me in general what goes on\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 9:55:52pm\par
 Teslaman: There's still a high level of interest. Hundreds find their way here daily and that's only a small fraction since I'm a bit of a hole in the wall since I don't promote the site with SEO stuff. No social media presence, etc. Hehe, yeah she has told me that she is done now, but strangely wouldn't confirm that for everyone on here. Since she lied so much to me, I just don't believe her on anything anymore, but that's what she said anyways. Lol, I've seen it a few times and vaguely remember that.  Oh yeah, certainly life changing money.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 10:01:45pm\par
anon9870: Wow, I've got to feel some respect for her with the little knowledge I have then. Obviously I don't know your whole story which might greatly change that opinion but from the outside it seems like the actions of a good person. I hope she's proud of what she's done in many ways. I don't know how or what I would do in any of the situations she's found herself in and I'll never really know\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 10:02:58pm\par
anon9870: I imagine she grew up very fast during that time and experienced a lot of strange things and mixed emotions\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 10:07:42pm\par
anon9870: And I just can't not believe she comes on here, I mean we're all a little narcissistic to some extent and who wouldn't look at a site dedicated to them and generally very positive about them. It's got to feel good at some moments in anyone's life surely\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 10:16:41pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah exactly, shared things like that are what had earned my respect. But yeah, everyone has some good aspects like that. Sadly some very big negative ones will overshadow those things though. I actually wouldn't say that she did grow up fast during that time. It amazes me the things she still does, says and doesn't know, for someone with her past experience. I don't want to go into that though, as it's personal stuff.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 10:16:48pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, yeah I'm not sure how often she might check on here, but there are most certainly what I call her "minions", which isn't a reference to the movies actually, lol. The minions could be friends of hers, or actually her in disguise, which she still does like a teenager. Certain commenters on here have said stuff only she would know about me, so those had better be her. Not that she will ever admit it. If I was madly paranoid, I'd say the NSA was posting, hahaha.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 23, 10:28:30pm\par
 Teslaman: There is plenty of negative stuff on here though that I'm calling her out on, but I try to make it clear that it's not to attack her maliciously. I genuinely want her to improve herself and recognize the very hurtful things she has done. I've already tried doing that privately with her, at great length, but as is so typical with women in general, they just get madly defensive and combative. I can only hope that over time it will sink in with the proper affect.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 12:56:32am\par
 Teslaman: Oh and on the money offers, well you really don't need to have been offered that kind of money to know what you would do. It really depends on your set of principles. Mine are such that I know for an absolute fact that I'd turn it down if it conflicts with who I am. It wouldn't even be a second thought for me. You'd have to know me to know why that is, but it's something I can say with absolute confidence. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 2:29:29am\par
 Teslaman: \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 2:42:03am\par
 Teslaman: Just to prove that a bit, no brag, just fact, there's a screenshot from the old KnCMiner forums where SharkCat freely gave me a loan of 8 bitcoin to my wallet, about $8,000 at the time, which I promptly paid back. Some old time regulars on here might remember back when I mentioned needing that loan. It might even be in the old chat still, I'm not sure.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:02:58pm\par
anon1824: .....Well I guess I was right then, the money was pretty big. I guess in my mind I was thinking if ya not embarrassed showing your body as she did then why not make a nice sum of money and be done. I mean some of them can girls barely show anything and somehow still make money. I mean ultimately hers pics have gone on anyway lol new shared pics & who knows maybe some guy will come along with a treasure chest of stuff & they weren't meant to be seen. If she had done it herself it would be under her control. I mean who knows, looking like she does she probably would have ended up online whether she did back then or not.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:09:56pm\par
anon1824: .....i mean she clearly got a kick out of being on camera, I wouldn't and is why nobody is gonna be dragging up a video of me lol (crosses fingers) but she was playing to it and working it! So that doesn't sound like a problem for her. I guess maybe people would recognise her where she lived etc? Maybe u know about this. Maybe her family, I get all the reasons not to on that level. I guess I might never know if u don't.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:20:41pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah I'd have to check the numbers again, but I think the one offer was 20k pounds. Oh stuff still gets shared around privately too and it can stay that way for a long time if you're careful about who you share with. Frankly these new ones would still be private if that's what the guy had asked me to do. I'm sure everyone else is happy he didn't, lol. Yeah same here, lol. Only one person has ever had the opportunity to see stuff I recorded years ago.  Yes, family is what controls her decisions.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:31:12pm\par
anon3928: Well that makes sense then, gotta listen to ya family. Pretty sure I know what mine would say!......im guessing hers said the same lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:31:24pm\par
 Teslaman: That's a real shame to me though. Screw what your family thinks, it's your life! I've been the black sheep of mine for a long time until my cousin went even further and got disowned for years, lol. None of us agree with his choices, but he stuck by them and family is slowly accepting him back anyways.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:32:24pm\par
 Teslaman: Takes balls to be your own person. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:32:25pm\par
anon3928: I guess so, but I think it's maybe hard when it impacts them in a negative way\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:33:09pm\par
anon3928: I wouldn't care for me but I couldn't upset my family for any amount of money\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:34:21pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh it's definitely hard, but I don't like having my actions dictated to me by others, family or not. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:37:50pm\par
 Teslaman: It's like you've never truly left the nest, even if you physically have, if your family still controls you actions. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:38:33pm\par
anon3928: If I trusted them and loved them I'd consider it and if most felt the same I'd more than likely listen. Surely family and sometimes close friends to a greater extent are most important to consider. I mean the whole reason they are what they are is because u both consider your actions toward one another\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:40:07pm\par
anon3928: Otherwise they're nothing more than everybody else and they only receive the same civil amount of consideration you should give to everyone\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:41:19pm\par
 Teslaman: I very much disagree. Then you aren't being an independent person. They should love you no matter your choices, otherwise they aren't truly family to begin with.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:43:55pm\par
anon3928: You can still love someone and disagree with their choices, but it doesn't mean you're not hurting them. I mean a serial killers mother still loves her child but is hurt by his choices.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:45:47pm\par
anon3928: I know this isn't murder lol but the point stands, she could have done whatever and yes her family would still love her but she could never take away the hurt it caused them.....maybe (not knowing anything really lol)\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:46:13pm\par
 Teslaman: I know who my true family is, the rest can get bent if they care that little about me that they think they have the right to control my actions. They aren't my owners and I'm no slave. Everyone gets hurt man. You don't think families get hurt when their only child comes out as gay, killing the family line in its tracks? Life is pain.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:49:21pm\par
anon3928: True....life is, and all we can do is try to step around the broken glass until the end of the track or we can stomp through it and say what the fuck, I'm gonna get hurt anyway\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:51:17pm\par
anon3928: I don't know the ins and outs but I think it's a difficult thing to go through as a family and oui can't say if I had a daughter I would be the cool liberal dad\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:55:59pm\par
 Teslaman: Or put on shoes and laugh at conquering the glass.  But yes and the next time your feet won't be so soft and things will be easier. As the saying goes, adversity makes men and prosperity makes monsters. In other words, the easy road breeds weakness. Well, I'm libertarian, aka classical liberal, but personally conservative. So I wouldn't be happy with my daughter either, but I'd recognize that it's her life.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 7:57:36pm\par
anon3928: Lol good point,\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:01:12pm\par
anon3928: That reminds me of a ricky gervais joke, pol pot was frightened by scholars and would like men up, any with glasses would be killed.........if they were that intelligent why didn't they just take them off (abridged)\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:01:24pm\par
anon3928: *line\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:02:56pm\par
anon3928: I think there are a lot of liberal people and some would say..........."what MY daughter.........oh No! Lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:05:05pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol  Indeed, there are some things in life worth disguising if it means saving your ass.  Ha, well there are a lot of people pretending to be liberal these days. We call them neo-libs, or alt-left. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:06:27pm\par
 Teslaman: Libtard works too when you're in a foul mood from their stupidity, haha.\par

Thu Aug 24, 8:07:01pm\par
anon3928: "I'm liberal to a degree.....i want everybody to be free...." (Bob dylan)\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:09:34pm\par
anon3928: I wouldn't claim to be liberal, that would be just too definitive........or is that what a liberal person would say lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:11:55pm\par
 Teslaman: Exactly, that's classical liberal, more like Thomas Jefferson. Nothing wrong with being personally conservative as long as you respect others right to do otherwise. Haha, yeah never claim to be liberal, since the meaning has changed. That's why libertarian was coined.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:15:40pm\par
 Teslaman: Liberal these days is more aligned with being oppressive of anyone they disagree with. Like Milo Yiannopoulos. The so-called liberals hate him, but funny enough, he's more embraced by conservatives...and he's flaming gay! lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:21:22pm\par
anon3928: You sound like a well educated person teslaman, I tip my cap and bend at the knee. I feel like I'm jumping on a bike with evel knievel, I'm gonna go places I've never been and I'm not gonna know how I got there lol an expert I am not......from the last sentence, a star wars fan I am lol. I'm the guy who can join in for 5mins on anything......and then slowly dissipate from the conversation after the first paragraph on Wikipedia lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:21:23pm\par
 Teslaman: I'm not sure, but I think Hannah always assumed that I was her type of "liberal", but ew, no. lol \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:22:56pm\par
anon3928: I get the impression Hannah is neither u or I\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:25:08pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, thanks! Expanding my mind is my primary focus. I'm just also passionately aggressive, lol. Haha, well enjoy the magic carpet ride. You might find it too fun to get off!  Indeed, she is far more like a typical "liberal", but there's still hope for her, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:28:49pm\par
anon3928: You've got to remember she's from England as I am, English culture in my life experience is far from liberal, and especially where sex is concerned. Europe we are not!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:32:54pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, well England is extremely "liberal" by American standards. Lots of things are banned over there now, lol. But yeah, as far as sex goes, you guys seem to be far more conservative. Which I align with too. Even if I had the body of a Olympian god, you wouldn't see me in porn, haha. But I appreciate the free spirited naughty girls just the same. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:35:20pm\par
 Teslaman: Which is why I have to laugh when people claim to be liberal, but want to go around banning things they disagree with. I'm like, do you not see the contradiction there? lol \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:41:43pm\par
anon3928: Ya not wrong about America on everything other than sex, at times it seems like a really large adult with learning difficulties we have to appease cuz it could go off the rails at any given moment.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:42:09pm\par
 Teslaman: Take Trump for example. That man is much more classical liberal than any "far right" person would like. If you dig into his past, he has done so many things that would be considered liberal. But, "liberals" hate him, because he isn't afraid to be pigeonholed and bullied. They want him to decry only violent intolerant right people, but not violent intolerant left people. It's hilarious actually. Here he puts out the most fair statement condemning any kind of hate, which is very classical liberal, but the "liberals" attack him like rabid dogs. I don't think they realize just how brain dead they actually are.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:44:27pm\par
anon3928: You're right again. It made me laugh actually as he seems more and more like Michael from the office lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:45:51pm\par
anon3928: It's like he tries really hard but still doesn't get the laugh\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:46:57pm\par
anon3928: I'm not a supporter of his in any way but I heard nothing wrong in what he said but at the same time heard everything that would be lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:47:57pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, yeah there is an old quote by one of our Founders basically saying that over there you're free to walk behind very tall walls, lol. I'm glad to hear though that more classical liberal values are slowly starting to take hold again though. I just hope they can win before it's too late! Ah I wouldn't know that reference, I watch very little TV. Last new show I wanted to watch was Human Target, back in 2010, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:50:09pm\par
anon3928: Basically the humour of the show is hes the idiot but sometimes even when he's bang on the cast don't get it, thus they ultimately are the fools but we're meant to be on their side\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:52:47pm\par
anon3928: He says the wrong thing at the wrong time, he thinks before speaking, he's rude, he's desperate for approval and annoying.......but he's always trying to do want people want him to do, he just doesn't have a filter\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:53:47pm\par
anon3928: But he's probably not that bad of a person.......hperson.......hes just not an office manager lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:54:21pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe, yeah there is just no winning with people who hate your very existence. They will take any words you say and twist the living hell out of it. Ah, hehe.  Yeah, although I wouldn't say Trump is an idiot by a long shot. He intentionally baits the left very well, lol. He's just very blunt and plain spoken, which drives them up a wall since they are afraid to speak anything that might be deemed offensive, lol. He'll put out something they will latch onto, then while they are distracted, get something important done. By the time they realize it, it's too late, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:56:01pm\par
anon3928: True he's not an idiot.....but neither is Michael in the office.........hes a *t salesman and a great host\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:56:15pm\par
 Teslaman: He basically speaks like every other conservative American speaks. We give no fucks about who is offended, haha. Makes him the perfect "Man of the people", except for those intolerant "liberals", lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 8:56:49pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol, must be one of the filtered words. \par

anon3928: Why can I not say *t\par

anon3928: It's *t\par

anon3928: Wow there s no way round lol it's just a word\par

anon3928: Just a bit, I'll try to be more negative\par

anon3928: I see the Americanism we now use is................Super \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:11:04pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah over here most of us are sick and tired of Politically Correct language, tip toeing around words like they're land mines, so a ton of us love his brazen bluntness.  You'd have to get comfortable with that around me too, as I give no fucks either, haha. The problem is, these people don't have critical thinking skills to understand what it is you're saying. It's like when black people go around saying "nigger" to each other. People are unbiased and frankly white guilted enough to know they aren't being racist to themselves, lol. But just say Muslim and everyone jumps on "racist!" as if that's even a race to begin with, haha. If these people didn't have so much power over laws, we could just laugh at their stupidity. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:12:59pm\par
 Teslaman: Haha, I guess.  We actually use it in that sense, like a brilliant engineer, meaning highly intelligent. But otherwise, yeah not really.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:16:26pm\par
 Teslaman: That's like Milo, he's gay and calls himself a faggot all the time, lol. It's like George Carlin says, words are only negative when we use them that way.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:17:17pm\par
 Teslaman: Or like Sam and Dean on Supernatural calling each other Bitch and Jerk, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:17:30pm\par
anon3928: Ownership of words is a joke, the power they have been given is ridiculous. It's mainly ridiculous because half the world rely more on pitch and guestures\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:17:58pm\par
 Teslaman: Exactly.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:18:57pm\par
anon3928: It's another form of currency, controlled and divided up\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:20:11pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah, but only in certain circles. These days that bunch of circle jerkers are losing power. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:20:50pm\par
 Teslaman: Which is funny to watch them running around getting "triggered" like a bunch of headless chickens. lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:23:33pm\par
anon3928: It's like an early warning alarm for the system\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Aug 24, 9:27:25pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah and that's the other thing that cracks me up. Here we've finally put the establishment on notice that we're sick and tired of their BS, but people who claim to be anti-establishment, just parrot the media talking points which are in favor of maintaining that system, lol. The brainwashing is strong.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Aug 25, 4:16:40am\par
 Teslaman: Anyways, got distracted getting the new water filter up and going, lol. 50% off sale, couldn't pass that up!  But yes, I really have never judged people on their speaking. You have to listen to the message, not the words. Sadly the media makes everything about words. "OMG! Did you hear what such and such said?!" Nah, I heard what they meant. \par

 Teslaman: That's like I heard the message you were saying, not for the first time either, which can't be a coincidence. I'm not missing the point, but I'd rather encourage people to blaze their own path and not enable that kind of oppressive thinking. I should also note that, yes, I'm a scary level of analytical, lol. It's actually inherited. I'll just go ahead and say that I know it freaks the hell out of Hannah, lol. Most conservative minded people are like that actually. It's just an ability to put emotion at the back of the line and come at things like a vulcan, lol. But if you push the right buttons, you'll certainly see the emotion! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Aug 26, 3:12:59am\par
 Teslaman: Speaking of pushing the right buttons... I might not have made this clear enough, but she and I were both painfully crystal clear the last time we spoke, that we'd never be speaking again. I can't say if she truly believes the absolutely unbelievable shit she has said about me, or if it was just some brutal shaming tactic, but I'd be amazed if she ever tried again. She never did a single thing to make up for the really hurtful crap she said, she only compounded it, so as far as I'm concerned, talking is pointless until that changes.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Aug 26, 3:13:08am\par
 Teslaman: I'll always be open to it, but I don't ever expect it to happen now. And since I can't have any resolution to those things that were said, no remorse or care shown, then I won't let the site have any resolution either. Keeping the history and proof up is my only solace since it's impossible for me to forget anyways. That's why it continues on, even though she will twist that real reason into the fucked up, totally warped shit that she has said about me. There, maybe that's finally clear for once, even though it quite depresses the conversation, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Aug 26, 4:18:35am\par
 Teslaman: Oh and you could say: "Geez man, maybe just quit anyways, instead of trying to prove everything, and she'll finally make up to you." Yeah, that's what so many guys do these days. They just chop off their balls and hope that it gets them something back. Nope, she was wrong for deceiving and lying to me about everything, just because she judged me for running a fansite. Fuck her six ways from Sunday until she realizes that. Sorry, got in a mood today after reading some of those emails again, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Aug 27, 1:27:37am\par
 Teslaman: Also, if you want to see someone who is truly worthy of being called vile and disgusting, then look up Keith Raniere.  I guess it just irks me that people can say they have read everything on here, but then still say she seems like a good person. I just can't believe you're being sincere at that point. Then that certain topic gets brought up again, which I was also told by an unproven person who I'm still suspicious of. After that, Hannah starts asking about what they told me, keeps probing when I don't mention that part, or anything of personal substance, and drops it entirely when I ask if there was anything specific she was wondering about. To me, the question on here about it again was like another probe wanting me to acknowledge it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Aug 27, 1:27:53am\par
 Teslaman: Might sound paranoid, but you basically have to think like a detective about every little detail, since the people involved have proven to be very deceptive. So fine, either way, I have acknowledged it now. I didn't want to get into that with her, since I very adamantly do not agree with that oppressive mentality and knew it'd just be another pointless argument. I'm really just not going to care if someone bowed to that kind of pressure, but especially not, when I've been treated like worthless, subhuman shit by that person. I think that about sums it up for me now. I managed to avoid going off in chat about this stuff for about 4 months now. Which was mainly due to her accusing me of just using her to talk to people on here. I've explained the stupidity of that on here earlier, so I won't rehash it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Aug 28, 5:33:57pm\par
uksexguy: hi all\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 11:20:11am\par
anon0828: ....hi again, sorry if I dragged up some old stuff there, I've been coming on here for years but I havent seen all the back and forth between the 2 of you so I have no idea what she has said and what things went on between you guys. That is a little insight but its still all a little bit of a mystery without knowing all the detail. I wasnt trying to say she is great or a good person, I suppose I was just putting a spin on things from only really knowing little bits and hoping she was\\is a good person. I guess I'd like to think she was cuz if I knew all the detail and had the involvement you had I'd probably think much like you do....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 11:20:36am\par
anon0828: ...At the end of the day what I 'think' i know is that she had a boyfriend he obviously wanted to film her (who wouldnt) he and or she wanted to show them to people, then with the interest they wanted to set up a site or something to get paid and then she split with this guy and she didnt want to do it anymore. Now I know thats probably all bullshit and you're having a laugh at my lack of knowledge but like i say it's a bit of guess work and assumption. I apologise for the fact that you're probably thinking 'its on here just read the stuff' and I'd agree, I have read a lot of things on here, some of it years ago and the truth is I probably forgotten more than I know...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 11:20:55am\par
anon0828: ....Thanks for the interesting chat the other day I did look up Milo Yiannopoulos, to me he seemed like a man from a privileged background with a lack of empathy, maybe just the interview I saw. But I dont have any problem with what he's saying, I just dont think I would take much out of anything he has to say. I couldnt help but feel like he was saying....'look at me please'\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 7:23:17pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah a lot of the important bits are already on here, but the main summary is what I mentioned before our chat. She judged me as bad from the start just for making a fansite of very widespread, public content. (Which btw, is content she knew all along wasn't legal, but didn't show any personal responsibility to prove to everyone.) In her mind, that perfectly justifies her lying to, deceiving and manipulating me for years. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 9:07:46pm\par
 Teslaman: I'm apparently worthless, an online nobody to her, she doesn't give a damn that her deceit of friendship really hurt me and she keeps trying to say that the only reason I'm upset is because she didn't end up giving me nudes! Talk about adding insult to injury! She damn well knows better than that, especially with how many times I've explained it at great length. I'm sure she treats you great if she judges you to be acceptable, according to her very warped view of the world. I also know that she would be making a very personal exception for me if she did send me new stuff, which in this specific case, makes it the perfect way to make things up to me.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 9:08:59pm\par
 Teslaman: What happened is more complicated than that, like her telling me after they split that she still wanted to do it and attempted to send me stuff from her blackberry, but yes, that's a simplified version of events. Well see, that's the same kind of snap judgment of a person that Hannah did with me. Milo had a very abusive childhood, something I can relate to (there I said it), although not to his specific extent. So it's not a lack of empathy, it's a complete lack of caring what people think about you. He's showing others the strength that comes from that, instead of being a victim mentality crybaby about it like they do with their "triggering", "safe spaces" and rabid desire to ban anything "offensive" as hate speech.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 9:13:58pm\par
 Teslaman: People are pussies these days, adult babies and it needs to stop. I also disagree with your view of the US being overgrown and always in danger of going off the rails. We act like actual adults by stepping over the line of civility when someone threatens our freedoms. Anyways, with him, you don't have to condone his life choices. The important, classical liberal thing, is only that you share a view for allowing people the freedom to live as they wish and say what they like. Unlike "liberals" who call you a "homophobe" for not accepting homosexuality as normal, or worse, will arrest you for "hate speech" like they do over there. Milo actually tolerates your views. Unsurprisingly, that gets him the same tolerance back for his views. Which is exactly why the intolerant "liberals" hate him so much.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Aug 29, 9:40:06pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh and since she doesn't even care to remember the things she said... How about when I called her out on my knowing that she was lying and her response was that she can lie about anything she wants to lie about. Well no duh, but way to prove how shit you actually are! Bravo there! Own it like a badge of stupidity! lol Just...wow. Oh and if she truly views me that poorly, then just imagine what she thinks of her fans. Yep, she also said she just came on here for the laughs. Basically, we're all pathetic and need to give a life. And if you do have a life, then you're just a sick fuck for being on here. Yep, I said it. Fuck judgmental people like that.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Aug 30, 7:02:00am\par
 Teslaman: This: https://thenarrativetimes.org/2017/08/27/joy-villa-kaya-jones-censored-youtube/ and this: \par
\par
 exemplifies pretty much everything I've said. Also, anon, I get wanting her to be a good person, as that was my hope and error too. Despite my anger with her, I still futilely hope she will choose to open her mind one day, instead of becoming more and more narrow minded the older she gets. She falsely thinks it's maturity. There is no magic maturity once you hit 30. Age has nothing to do with it. Cracks me up too with how much stock people put in a number. "Oh I'm 30 now, time to be an adult." Used to be, that time came at least 12 years prior to that, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Sep 5, 12:37:36am\par
 Teslaman: So I decided to search up some modern stupidity today. I guess I like punishing myself, lol. One thing reminded me of anon's "filter" comment. Filtering yourself is something I will never understand. Elitist, classist and political people always do it, but screw them anyways. For example, Hannah's "filtering" is what led to all of this. When you think someone is utter shit from the outset, but treat them nicely like a friend for years, that's called being a two-faced liar.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Sep 5, 12:37:47am\par
 Teslaman: You filtered yourself, so you're only polite, polished and nice. That shows me that you care more about your own image, than the feelings of the person you are deceiving and ultimately hurting. Being blunt and unfiltered is totally honest and real. It's like ripping a band-aid off, versus pulling it off slowly. It's how you get that thick skin to protect yourself. If everyone was a filtered liar, then everyone would be soft panzy pushovers...oh wait, they mostly are now! Imagine that.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 9:42:21am\par
anon9624: ....not sure what filtering refers to as u seem to be vague, almost like ya filtering your comment lol. Anyway, the first guy is a complete bell end and having read his bio I still think he's a privileged individual with 'look at me' syndrome. What ever the reasons he may have obtained that persona doesn't make it untrue. Whether or not he was abused doesn't change what he is. You can feel sorry for him but it doesn't change anything. There's little that separates us from apes, one of those things is language. I guess we could all just spew out every thought we had....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 9:47:36am\par
anon9624: ....i guess that works but I don't know about anyone else but sometimes I think something that I don't truly believe myself......its a thought. I have a million thoughts a day, doesn't mean I want to act on or announce each one when I have it. I like to consider my thoughts, think through what I know, maybe gain more knowledge, maybe change my mind........and then deliver it in a coherent fashion......\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 9:54:41am\par
anon9624: ....but you're right, I'm guilty, I do have a filter.........my brain, without it id struggle, so I guess I'm stuck with it. I don't know what u would like me to say but if I turn the filter off I'll start writing and never stop. It would consist of partial sentences, flicking from one thing to the next with no link between, random words, images that appear and mild into something else. Love, pain, anger all at once. I'd be my own monkey at a typewriter waiting for Shakespeare to appear\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 9:56:47am\par
anon9624: ....btw I agreed with most of what the woman said :^)\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:32:00am\par
 Teslaman: Lol, no it wasn't vague, it was a reference to what you said earlier about some people not having a filter, as if that's a bad thing. I would absolutely prefer to deal with someone who doesn't even think before they speak, than to deal with someone who is so heavily filtered that everything you see and hear is a total lie. I'm not really talking about that "thinking before you speak" type of buffering, but more the "proper" filtering that Brits are especially notorious for doing. As in, not speaking your mind, not being plain spoken. Where you can't stand someone, but you have a 99.99% filter that just leaves you with this fake pleasantry towards said person, completely deceiving them.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:36:47am\par
 Teslaman: As I said, it's the same filtering that elitists, classists and politicians do, where essentially everything you say is a lie. Also often speaking with a very passive aggressive, sarcastic, forked tongue. Sweet mercy, that is the absolute height of agitating! Again, it's all very two-faced. Those type of people are only concerned with themselves, how their words will make them look. It's massively narcissistic/self-centered/selfish. They have no regard for how that deception will affect others, when they inevitably learn the truth. Yet those same people claim to be nice and caring. HA!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:43:27am\par
 Teslaman: With Milo, see that's the thing I don't do. Judge people based on personality. I see through that to the individual. People can be stiffs, or totally wacky and vulgar, which can be a sum of experiences, or a result of genetic disposition. But what matters to me, what I see, is their beliefs. Do they have those core values that matter? Milo is a typical flamboyant homosexual, that's his personality. He uses that flavor unique to him, to spread his message of valuing freedom. With him, he's primarily focused on freedom of speech. He is intentionally vulgar and as non-PC as humanly possible, to shock the living daylights out of those rod up the ass people who want to ban every damn thing. Personally, I don't care for his style, but I recognize and appreciate that he's on the right side. That's what matters.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:44:51am\par
anon7434: Well I have a unique perspective on filtering. About 6 years ago I developed vitiligo on my hands and face which has spread further so I observe people filtering every day. I see them notice and filter their thoughts. Is that a bad thing? The fact that they care enough not to dig deeper without any prior knowledge.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:47:34am\par
anon7434: I agree that he basically goes over the top on purpose and is why I don't really judge anything from his words.......but you do, how can u make an assessment on someone who is also not telling the truth? He might go home say and think completely different, why would u assume not.....he's willing to say things that he doesn't entirely believe so as to make a point as you said\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:50:52am\par
anon7434: I guess I'd be interested in what 'core beliefs' you hold dear. That would probably answer a lot of questions. If your core beliefs do not accentuate your personality then why are u pretending to be something u are not. Why are u hiding behind a persona, is that not just the same?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:53:51am\par
 Teslaman: As I said, that's thinking before you speak. But also, an expression doesn't actually convey thoughts. It's your perception of that expression that you make a judgement of thought on. A grimace expression can merely mean a reaction of sympathetic thought for something they know isn't fun to have. He is actually telling the truth though, why do you assume that speaking in an unfiltered manner means that he is being untruthful? If I say, "Damn that's a fucking ugly ass painting!" that is the same as saying, "I do not personally find that painting to be aesthetically pleasing, but that is only my opinion." both are true.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:55:24am\par
anon7434: Is it society you want to remove? Are we all not in this world for ourselves? Is that not at the core of every human being. Why do u assume it's not filtered? Is it not the same argument, how do u know what he does or doesn't filter\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:55:37am\par
 Teslaman: Of course, saying that in a British fashion would be more like... "Were you blind when you painted that?" Or, "Oh, how nice." lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 11:57:40am\par
anon7434: And yes those 2 statements are exactly the same. Why is one stronger than the other? Because u think the language of one is less filtered than the other?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:00:56pm\par
anon7434: A famous blues musician called son house had a song called 'don't mind people grinning in your face' that's how I tend to treat people, you can never and will never know if what someone tells u is true or false and to what extent they believe it to their core\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:01:07pm\par
 Teslaman: Well, my core beliefs would be a long discussion, but no, I wear everything on my sleeve. Everything I say, matches perfectly with everything I believe. I don't care for lying, it's childish. Liars never grew up. I wish to remove fakeness, to tell people that intentionally deceive that they are shit human beings, because they are. Yes, one is certainly filtered. They took their revulsion and put it though a filter of politeness, or of plain lying, as with the other examples.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:02:56pm\par
 Teslaman: Well, those type of people are not adapt at reading people, because most people you can plainly see when they are lying and being fake.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:06:24pm\par
anon7434: You honestly trying to tell me no one has ever fooled u lol there are people out there with complete double life's that nobody ever spots. I think you're underestimating the power of liars\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:11:12pm\par
anon7434: Nut what if the person just doesn't feel as strongly about the painting as u do, and who decides one statement is worse than the other? Surely it's the person the statement is uttered towards. Let's say u said that to the artist, he may think nothing of it. But if a fellow artist said the other statement he'd be devastated\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:12:05pm\par
 Teslaman: Reading people is a gift, it's very hard to fool me, but not impossible of course. Obviously Hannah managed to fool me with her filtering, which is my entire point to saying all of this to begin with, lol. I knew how she was from the beginning, I knew she lies, I was told she manipulates, but when you talk with someone over years, share personal stuff and underline the importance of honesty, you put a level of trust in them that they are being up front with you.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:15:12pm\par
 Teslaman: That's exactly my point actually. It's who you are saying it to that matters. People will justify lying to someone that they know will take it badly, but doing so actually hurts them more in the long run, because the truth doesn't stay buried forever. If you are very, very lucky, they will die without finding out, but how people live with themselves is beyond me.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:20:26pm\par
anon9700: I do enjoy our chats \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:21:25pm\par
 Teslaman: And believe me, I know. As an immature kid, I was fantastic at lying and manipulating people. It's also why I hate it so damn much now, because I know first hand the pain it causes others, the absolute ton of work it is to maintain and how it makes you a really self-centered cunt.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:21:59pm\par
 Teslaman: Well that's good, usually I'm too intense for people and they can't handle it, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:24:56pm\par
 Teslaman: Of course, I should add, that I only did it to benefit myself. I wasn't the compulsive liar type, unlike some people I know, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:25:29pm\par
anon9700: No it's not too intense for me, I'm interested in people and why they think like they do. It's all interesting to me. Just to get a different perspective than my own. I like to learn and take what I can from others. I always like to be questioned on my own thoughts and beliefs. I'd actually rather speak to someone that has a different view than the same as I can learn nothing from the latter\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 12:31:00pm\par
 Teslaman: That's good, there aren't enough people like that. I like to hear the different views too, but I'd say that most of the time I can quickly find the fault and reject it. There have only been a few things in my life that I've ever changed my stance on and not even personally, only as it relates to others. Like drugs for example. I was quite conservative, "ban them all!", until I took in Libertarian views on the subject. It's true, banning things only makes them more desirable and dangerous. I still hate them and will never use them, but sure, leave others to be as stupid as they like, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:23:10pm\par
anon3509: Do you drink alcohol?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:23:22pm\par
 Teslaman: People like Hannah have a very hard time understanding me though. When you have core values, you simply don't change, because you know who you are. That's an alien concept to some. As I said, that would be a very lengthy discussion. It's just a bit amusing when she and others try to shame me in any way. It's like trying to tell a cat to be a dog, lol. Of course, I find it hilarious her trying to shame me anyways. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:24:01pm\par
 Teslaman: Nope. Never touched the stuff actually.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:24:16pm\par
anon3509: Coffee? Lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:25:08pm\par
 Teslaman: Not really, I've tasted it before and that was enough, lol. I'm one of the few people who doesn't even like the smell. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:26:07pm\par
anon3509: I have a friend who is the same and I always question her about it, "who doesn't like the smell" lol well I guess there are 2 now\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:26:55pm\par
 Teslaman: Haha, my one college friend is the same way, so there's 3, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:27:24pm\par
anon3509: Oh no! I can feel a movement starting\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:31:19pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol. Yeah I have some quite odd tastes when it comes to food. I have my own joke names for tea and coffee. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:32:38pm\par
anon3509: Most of my close friends I would say are similar to yourself. I do prefer a person who is open and honest. Do you not feel that sometimes people may not tell the truth for reasons only built on a lack of trust in what others may do with that information. Or maybe the truth would only serve to make people unhappy without any benefits to any of the people involved. I say this as I've heard people who are very forthright with honesty put into situations where they feel that the value of up holding that doesn't outweigh the damage it will cause\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:37:10pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh sure, people make all kinds of excuses for not telling the truth like that. Hannah did just that actually. It's quite simple though if you are uncomfortable telling some truth. You just don't say! lol I don't know why it's so hard to just say, "I'm not comfortable telling you that and I don't want to lie." But with causing unhappiness, like I said, they are just making things worse in the long run. Sure the truth hurts, I think we all know that. But a lie hurts a lot more and for a lot, lot longer.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:42:25pm\par
anon3509: Is it not narcissistic to only care about you being happy that the weight is off your shoulders and the consequences are out of your hands, but at least u feel good now. In regard to lies always coming out, I can think of a couple of cases I know of where it's never come out and never Will. Relating to families, in fact I'd have a good bet there are a lot of them cases & each one with it's own intricacy. I think it's impossible to blanket every circumstance and say the best option would always be tell the truth. Just not saying isn't always an option as not saying sometimes just gives the answer to a question that only has 2 answers\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 1:52:15pm\par
 Teslaman: Not at all, I'm always thinking of the other person when it comes to telling the truth. I think about how damaged they will be if they ever learned the truth. Like with Hannah, I will never forget this and she has no idea the lifelong damage her deception has done. If she was upfront, I'd be offended, but not actually hurt, since I didn't know her then and her opinion of me would have been meaningless at that point in time. Taking the chance they never find out is quite risky and is conflict avoidance.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 2:00:19pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah with those kind of questions, like, "Did you cheat on me?", not answering is an answer. But things like that are questions too important not to answer, or lie about. Like I said, maybe you get away with a lie like that, but I can't see how those people live with themselves. You're betraying yourself as much as the other person.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 2:41:45pm\par
 Teslaman: I also have a very long, living memory. Whatever I felt then, I will feel again. Things don't actually fade over time for me. That can be hellish tbh, but the point is, it's very easy for me to catch liars. As I said, it takes a ton of work to maintain a lie, compounding lies and trying to remember what you said before. In Hannah's case, she doesn't remember at all and the stories are always changing, lol. That's why I made the point about honesty being important. Lying about herself is one thing, but quite another thing to completely lie about what she thought of me. You know the consequences of that? None of these past years would have happened and I don't believe a single thing she tells me. She could apologize, but her words are meaningless now. Tangible proof is the only thing I'd believe.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 2:45:39pm\par
anon8804: Yes, back to the reason we are here lol. Well I can tell from all you've said that she ain't never coming on here. And the fact that she hasn't come in here and said 'coz away' tells me that she wants this here, she enjoys it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par

 Teslaman: Oh I wouldn't say that. I'd say she probably does come on here as an anon sometimes, or maybe even as some member. She has no problem pretending to be someone else. She definitely tried getting the new pics taken down though, but gave up once they spread around. As to why she won't prove it on here, you got me. After all, the thing that set everything off to begin with was her saying she'd happily do one last sign pic. I wish I didn't believe the things she said, but imagine how incredibly cruel that would be to say all of what she has said, if she doesn't even mean it. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Sep 9, 10:50:12pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh and I should point out on the no drinking booze, that it's a good thing it has never appealed to me, since I have alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. That's basically the stuff that protects/affects your lungs, liver, etc. So drinking or smoking is a sure way to kill myself quickly. I've never expected to have a long life anyways and I'm perfectly fine with that. Old age has always been very undesirable to me anyways, lol.\par

anon4075: That sure doesn't sound great, my mum has copd and I know that isn't fun! On another note, setting up this site & all, are u very internet wise? Just that I've heard u talk about bit coins and various other stuff. What's your background, was the emergence of Hannah the start of your learning curve or did u already have knowledge before that. Did u get a lot of knowledgeable people telling u things. Just interested to know if there was some good that came out of it for u\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Sep 10, 11:06:11am\par
 Teslaman: Ugh, sorry to hear that. Yeah my lungs have gradually been getting worse year by year. I've been on computers and the internet since about 1995. Went to college to get into robotics design, but decided against it for personal reasons. I'm more of a "jack of all trades, master of none" though, lol. I can't stand being limited to just one thing. And programming is definitely not my thing! This site was just a side project really. It paled in comparison to the rest of my sites. They were the start of my learning to run websites, but it certainly grew over the years from running this one. But nah, I've had very little help with this stuff. A couple of people have offered, but I prefer to do and learn things myself as much as I possibly can. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Sep 11, 6:50:54pm\par
 Teslaman: Funny fact I should mention. Obviously Hannah is big on comics, but I bet she doesn't even realize that many of the Marvel movie scripts have been nods to the same information that the people like me, Libertarians, Alex Jones, Ron Paul, Nigel Farage, etc have been talking about for decades. People are so dismissive of what they don't understand, yet it's also right in their face in entertainment. Just thought of that since I'm going to watch CA: Winter Soldier again. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Sep 11, 6:51:30pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh and yes, sometimes even the MSM tells the truth: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/us/politics/trump-republicans-third-parties.html No duh, the rest of us knew that ages ago, not that the MSM would tell you that in the midst of all their rabid, lying hit pieces.  That's what we voted for, because enough of us aren't blinded and judgemental about personality. It's not supposed to be a goram popularity contest!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Sep 14, 6:53:59pm\par
 Teslaman: You know, I knew better than to involve myself with a chick like her, but I also really wanted to give her a chance to prove me wrong. I really didn't want to be proven right. The funny thing is, I bet she thinks the exact same thing about me, lol. The problem is, she only proved herself right by treating me like she did. I've said many times that I will treat others as they treat me. If I treat you horribly, it's because you did too.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Sep 14, 6:54:13pm\par
 Teslaman: To truly understand me, all you need to know is that my favorite characters are Superman, Captain America, Punisher and Ghost Rider. They all reflect my values. The antiheroes are by far my favorite overall, but the other two also largely reflect my good natured side. That's the side you get when you treat me right. The antihero is the side you get when you don't. Simple as that, if you can call that simple, lol. \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Sep 21, 3:13:49pm\par
 Teslaman: @anon6631 Lol, your false judgements mean nothing to me.  In other words, let her just get away with treating people like garbage and don't hold her accountable. Sounds very stereotypical Millennial. It's totally up to her. She is the one who has chosen not to make up for her very hurtful lies, deception and manipulation. People like that deserve what they get.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Sep 21, 4:56:10pm\par
 Teslaman: She and you are complete idiots if you think I actually want to keep this place going. I tried not to get my hopes up, but a friend of mine can tell you how excited I got when it sounded like she might actually make up to me. Virtually everything out of her mouth is a lie though. Which is why it's so freaking laughable when either she or people like you try to judge me. I used to let people like her abuse me, walk all over me, by "turning the other cheek". You know what that does? Makes you a victim and they just keep on doing it, because they never learned how not to be a totally shit human being. So yes, I will sling the mud, I will make you hurt, so you can learn just what it feels like, because...fuck people like you. All you do is energize me more now. Got it? Get it? Good.\par

I prefer to be the lab rat in the background that no one hears about, lol. I absolutely loathe public speaking. Oh and I mixed that up, it's "Get it? Got it? Good." Been far too long since I used that. \par

And yes, that would've gladly included Hannah, if she didn't do all that she did. I actually like pleasing women the most, go figure. Love making them laugh! But I'm also not a pushover and toxic women don't get that from me. I won't let the screwed up people out there turn me into them. They might get me to stumble and fall, but they can't keep me down. Sorry, that got long winded again, lol. Consequence of a nice comment and being in a good mood from watching "The Pretender" again. Man I miss good TV that wasn't full of every manner of depravity! \par

It wasn't until years later that I read about all the hate. What can I say, I naturally fly in the face of conformity, lol! I also like fruitcake, as does most of my family!  I was equally surprised when I learned that soooo many people hate it, haha! Sorry for the downtime today too.\par

Sat Oct 14, 8:10:12pm\par
 Teslaman: I've never heard that, but it could explain a lot. If you were to believe Hannah, which I obviously don't anymore, then no, that was someone else after the fact. She was with Luke for several months after that video, as some of the videos and forum posts prove, so I find it pretty unlikely that it wouldn't have blown up before then. Unless of course she had an abortion, which I have heard rumor of before. It's all conjecture though, so I try not to get into it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Oct 14, 8:50:01pm\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Oct 19, 9:06:32pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah it has been posted on at least 4 sites that I've found so far. You have to be at least slightly geeky to find it though and you're on your own there. One guy figured it out a while back and started posting it everywhere. She of course accused me of doing it and said she was calling the police, which is thankfully laughable. That's just the kind of thing that inevitably happens when people learn how shitty you treat others.  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Oct 19, 9:41:04pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh and I can understand why she has turned out that way, if I'm to believe the things I've been told, but that's also no excuse whatsoever. I could treat everyone the same way, given my past too, but I refuse because it's freakin' very wrong. I just save that treatment for people who prove that they deserve it, which should be stating the obvious by now, lol.\par

It's preventable with a hosting upgrade, but donations haven't even passed the minimum for existing costs. $10 also gets you into my BnA site, so there's that too.  Putting this site behind a paywall did work to cover it, but meh. Funny how that pissed off Hannah too, as if that were somehow even remotely the same thing as what Karl did, lol. But...I didn't even consult her on it!  Yes, because that's the first thing one thinks of when they've been treated as mentioned and also told that she didn't want to discuss it anymore.  \par

I have lost track of the number of times that she tried equating things to rape and saying that I probably condone it, or would do it! Feminazis love pulling the Rape Card and don't even comprehend what "asking for it" even means. They just get hyper emotional about it and logic flies out the window. I knew she'd pull it too, hence that one picture on the About page, lol. But no, sorry, I'm the type of dude who would feed you through a wood chipper for raping a woman.\par

Unless she is still lying, I really don't think there is any chance anymore because of the ideology she has adopted. If that ever changes, she knows where to find me. \par

Mobile stuff is all convenience at the sacrifice of security, which is why I use none of it, lol. Nope. Although at one time I had pics/vids of my ex on the old version. I did make a few private ones available to Hannah, but they are back offline...aside from the NSA server backups, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 8:43:08am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: lol yeah I\rquote m sure they\rquote ve got a complete Hannah collection! That\rquote s interesting that she may have seen your stuff. I wonder if she\rquote s done a MFF threesome!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 8:50:32am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah I'll know who to blame if it gets out, lol.  Hard to say, but I don't think she has. At least based on the things I heard anyways.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 8:51:34am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: That\rquote s a shame, but then we also never saw any cumshots either so not surprising.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 8:53:42am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Or anal. Maybe she was just a tame amateur. But with untapped potential!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 8:59:34am\par
 Teslaman: Indeed. I can understand the anal, but the cumshots is just odd. Yeah it sounds so weird, a tame amateur that has no issues with threesomes and casual sex, lol! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 9:02:00am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: If you think about it, the threesome wasn\rquote t really a threesone was it. Alright she sort of sucked Luke\rquote s cock for a bit but was mainly just fucking Karl. Not like they DP\rquote d her or each had a go at her.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 9:18:31am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah although I don't know what he planned to do for batteries, lol. It wouldn't surprise me if that was just a lie for not wanting to show the finale as usual.  Now that's what I call, sloppy, sloppy seconds, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 9:20:23am\par
JustAnotherHanFan:  dripping! Damn, what might have been! For real? Was she on board with that idea?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 9:24:56am\par
 Teslaman: Dunno there, not sure how he sold the idea and totally can't go by what she said, lol. Although I hear she got around plenty, so it wouldn't surprise me at all.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 9:29:10am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Yeah she maybe does it most Saturday nights anyway! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 9:35:43am\par
 Teslaman: Lol, yeah, but dontcha know, she's just an innocent little housewife these days! She's proper now damn it! haha \par

Sun Oct 29, 9:38:17am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Yeah right. She ain\rquote t fooling no one! \par

Sun Oct 29, 10:09:10am\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Oct 29, 10:18:55am\par
 Teslaman: Not that I know about. She turned down the donations before, said she didn't want anything to do with it. Like it was some cursed, evil thing or something, lol. Only 300? Gimme 5 minutes! j/k \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 5:40:01am\par
 Teslaman: Lol, could be, or one of her friends. Coincidental timing, given some other things. Whoever it was, I see that they still opened up her nudes, lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 6:35:53am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Would she want her friends knowing about her teenage exploits??\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 6:49:07am\par
 Teslaman: Well it's kinda hard not to know really.  As far as I know, most of them know about it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 8:08:27am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Ah right. Then there\rquote s probably a while army of haters out there.\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 8:21:53am\par
 Teslaman: Haha, no doubt! I think there are people stirring crap on different sides though, but I can't be sure. I don't think she gets it that there are people who can't stand me just as much as they can't stand her and they create drama just for the lulz.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 8:25:55am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Never ending drama with this one I think. She should just give us what we want, then she\rquote d be left alone!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 8:34:41am\par
 Teslaman: Agreed on the never ending drama, lol. I think people are going to bug her regardless though, that's just the way of things when you're popular.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 8:39:17am\par
JustAnotherHanFan: She used to be popular. There\rquote s only a few of us active die-hard fans left.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 8:44:52am\par
 Teslaman: Well the daily visitors would say otherwise.  Plus her stuff constantly gets reposted to tube sites. 2004-2005 popular? Nah, but certainly still pretty high.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Nov 4, 9:35:18am\par
 Teslaman: Certainly plenty of the regulars have left though, but that's understandable given everything. I think they mostly just lurk for news now and spend some quiet time with the nudes, lol. \par

 Teslaman: Surprised it took that long since people have posted it around. According to Hannah, I have been giving out her info to over 50 people. Not true, someone could be impersonating me, but I've not seen any proof of it. Never even saw screenshots of those people saying it came from me, so it's probably more lies anyways. If true though, I'd love to talk to one of those people to see where it came from.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Nov 22, 2:59:40pm\par
anon6495: not much to see on her fb though\par

Wed Nov 22, 3:36:11pm\par

 Teslaman: Thanks to being able to hold the two Bitcoin donations for a bit of time, I think it's safe to say now that the Donation goal for this year has been met!  It was only $20 worth of BTC at the time, but it has already paid for $15 worth of hosting and the remainder still currently has a $40+ value! While that is great news, let me counter balance that by saying that I'd have over half a million dollars right now if I could have afforded to hold all of the bitcoin that I had mined.  \par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Dec 8, 5:24:40am\par
 Teslaman: Never heard of her since I don't follow pro-porn, but I gave her an honorary salute  So typical that the side of "tolerance" drove her over the edge with an onslaught of hate. It's quite common for them. Well, everything is real life though. Even when it's fake or candy coated, it's still an extension of us. The disconnect is exactly why all of this happened with Hannah. She even said that same thing to me, yet she then also expects me to feel bad for her? Can't have it both ways.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par

Sat Dec 16, 4:05:35pm\par
SpecialBuck: Sorry, it was written in the text, I was a bit lazy to read all of this lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Dec 16, 7:17:22pm\par
 Teslaman: @SpecialBuck Thanks and Merry Christmas to you guys too!  Hehe, yeah I wonder if the leaker will gift us with some more this year, lol. This Bitcoin price is an awesome present too! If this keeps up, then the hosting is covered for the next year+! As such, I've cut the price of joining my BnA site by 50%, now only $5!  @gonzaluskax: Yeah, those pictures were here, but I had to remove them since she wasn't of legal age at the time. Which btw, I wish I had pushed her for a clearer picture of her ID. Figgin' crappy cellphone cameras. \par

Sun Dec 17, 2:19:53pm\par
anon8038: Then how would I know in a private conversation tesla that you accused me of putting a fake masturbation video in there? I gave you something you waited years for and you question me like that?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 2:53:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Because that was also said in public chat, multiple times, lol.  There was so much wrong with that one. Wrong tattoo, file type, body type, pussy. I didn't just say that on a whim, lol. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would be quite surprised. Plus that's a very common thing for leakers to do, throw a random in and have a chuckle at people thinking it was the same person. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 3:10:56pm\par
anon4611: I get a lot of pictures, its not strange for batches to get mixed up. Anyway, this was the moment where the genuine leaker came back and was greeted with animosity. Don't hold your breath for anything new guys. I won't be coming back. I'll leave you to continue cherry picking selfies from her social media \u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 3:26:35pm\par
 Teslaman: Lol, not hardly and you're not greeted with animosity at all. I'm sure the leaker knows quite well how the internet works and knows that you can't just show up some place making claims without any proof. The leaker would sign into their chatango account and PM me. They also weren't shy about uploading anything.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 3:27:56pm\par
 Teslaman: As I've said before too, the leaker is also the only person I will grant the request to take the new stuff down. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 3:32:24pm\par
anon3949: I told you its fine to do whatever you like with it , its yours now. I never distributed it online so its not my problem. I'm telling you categorically that I was the leaker and theres not going to be any new stuff ever. Let this years gift from me be closure. She's a sneaky piece of trash but let her get on with her life now. I'll never leak anthing else of her.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 3:33:08pm\par
 Teslaman: Sure sure, it's a nice story.\par

Sun Dec 17, 3:37:02pm\par
 Teslaman: It's always the same story when people are pulling your leg, they can't prove it.\par

Sun Dec 17, 3:40:07pm\par

Sun Dec 17, 3:45:08pm\par
 Teslaman: On the about page, december 26th update. Seriously no offense meant to the leaker at all, but you have to know how many fakers I get constantly, many of which are most likely Hannah or her friends, lol. \par

Sun Dec 17, 3:46:39pm\par
anon0613: well as soon as I see the username I will log in\par

Sun Dec 17, 5:11:08pm\par
 Teslaman: Looks like we won't be seeing more from that leaker, so we'll just have to wait for the next one, or a recovery option is used.  Thanks again for confirming that and not leaving it up in the air as another classic Hannah fable, lol. Never a dull moment. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 5:38:45pm\par
 Teslaman: I know I'm tired right now, but allowing my brain to catch up on everything said...there are some contradictions there, lol. So who knows really what can or will happen.  I'll just go back to what I said originally: Merry Christmas and here's hoping for another gift. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 17, 11:53:35pm\par
JustAnotherHanFan: Apologies for my scepticism Mr. Leaker! And thank you for last years gift. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Dec 18, 7:42:15am\par
 Teslaman: Trust no one, but especially anons and certainly Hannah related anons.  To let you know what's really going on here, the overall message lately is one that I just recently addressed in an expansion of an old paragraph on the about page. May 1st, starts with "It is quite sad". Hopefully it clears the confusion about me. In short, people appeal to my decency, when I've been shown none. My actions are only a mirror of yours and anything that I might otherwise agree with, is irrelevant. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Dec 18, 12:30:41pm\par
SpecialBuck: The Bictoin price will go up to 1million next years, you're going to be rich Teslaman ! A shame I don't took the opportunity so early back in the days when I was sooo cheap lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Dec 18, 12:42:57pm\par
 Teslaman: That's what I've heard, which is why I finally charged an S9 to try and get some saved back up, lol. At $20k a pop, I would've been a millionaire, lol. Even my Neptunes are profitable again, so it's nice to have free heat and a profit now! Yeah I can't imagine the pain those guys are feeling who sold 1,000s of Bitcoin for dollars. Ouch! I hope it goes that way, I really look forward to buying everything I need to be completely off the grid, out in the middle of no where! My hermitization will be complete! Muahaha! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Dec 18, 3:10:11pm\par
SpecialBuck: Yes keep it long time you will no regret it ! I can't imagine the pain of that guy that bought 2 pizzas in 2010 for 10.000 bitcoins ... I really hope he enjoyed the pizzas ! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Dec 18, 4:00:48pm\par
 Teslaman: Yeah I will be holding onto it like, "It came to me, my own, my love, my precious.".  Ha, yeah hope that was some amazing pizza, stellar, I mean fantastic.  That's kinda like what would happen if the fiat dollar started to suddenly reverse from all the value it has lost since the gold standard. Suddenly that $5 loaf of premo bread could have bought you 10 loaves.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Dec 19, 6:33:11pm\par
 Teslaman: Speaking of Bitcoin, I just received my power supply order today, except there was a problem....they sent another S9 miner!   Looks like they only charged for the PSU too! I'm not sure if a new leak could top that for being an amazing Christmas!  Talking to support now of course and might point it to one of their pool accounts for a bit so they're not so boned on it, lol. But wow!  \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Dec 19, 6:42:25pm\par
 Teslaman: Heh, their mistake, but they think they can demand I return it. They and people on eBay, are now charging $6k for a miner that is selling for $2.7k from the manufacturer atm. They are that damn greedy, but try to make me feel bad for wanting to keep it, even when I'm willing to mine it at their pool account for a bit to compensate them. Plus their terms also state that you're just screwed if it arrives broken. Won't be buying from them again for sure now. I was even going to buy the power supplies from them again. Way to shoot yourself in the foot. Most people wouldn't even tell them about the mistake and that's what others have already told me I should have done, lol. I'm not like that though. So they can take my offer, or leave it.\par

--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Dec 20, 4:38:50pm\par
 Teslaman: I dunno about that, but thanks.  Just funny that you're under no legal obligation to return stuff you didn't order, or even notify them, but the dude proceeds to threaten legal action and essentially says "we know where you live", lol. He could've gotten compensated and more biz, but instead decides to be an ass about it. His loss. \par

Just remember now, you're a vile misogynist(someone who hates women) for loving and admiring their beauty, sexiness and pretty much everything about them, to the point of having made a fansite dedicated to them. lol  What feminists actually mean by "misogynist", is men who won't tolerate the BS from internally ugly women. Kinda like how it's only "sexual harassment", if they find you unattractive. \par

UKPhoenix: Lovely snow capped peaks  Belated xmas and have a fappy new year guys!\par

Wed Dec 27, 7:12:09pm\par
 Teslaman: Hehe.  Long time no see! Welcome back and the same to you. \par

hannnnahhhh: God\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 6:21:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: Do you literally just sit on my fb \u-10179?\u-8702?\u-10179?\u-8702?\u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 6:23:25am\par
hannnnahhhh: You've cum over a picture of me that you've cropped children out of either side.....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 6:24:03am\par
hannnnahhhh: That is the single worst thing I have ever srent\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 6:24:13am\par
hannnnahhhh: *seen\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 6:24:57am\par
hannnnahhhh: We actually had a bet last night how long it would take for you to steal the new picture\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 6:25:04am\par
hannnnahhhh: I didn't win \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 6:26:14am\par
hannnnahhhh: Anyone on here please feel free to message me as I have a few matters to clear up\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:00:01am\par
themunted: Holy shit. Merry Christmas Hannah\par

Thu Dec 28, 7:30:45am\par
 Teslaman: Real name this time and pretty civil, thank you. Lol, of course not. I was raised on PCs, so I just let software do all the work. Open it, that pic is a fake, lol. I goofed around on one of those fake cumshot websites. Well, it was the only picture with you making the correct facial expression, lol. I also knew it would get that reaction. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:36:09am\par
hannnnahhhh: I'll fake Cum over a picture with kids in to get a reaction....You're actually vile.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:37:43am\par
hannnnahhhh: At least everyone else I've spoken to is normal\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:39:23am\par
 Teslaman: And there it is, lol. No, it wasn't planned that way at all. More like, I looked for a picture, saw that was the only match, said "figures", then did it anyways. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:39:31am\par
hannnnahhhh: You need to go and see a doctor\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:39:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: Really.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:40:25am\par
 Teslaman: Nothing has changed, lol. Coming from the one who thinks normal is overrated and boring.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:41:29am\par
hannnnahhhh: Sitting on here all day everyday lying about talking to me. I'm your whole life. I put a new profile picture up and it's there within seconds. What's saddest about this is that youll just be excited im on here for some drama. You sad sad manews\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:41:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: *man\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:42:10am\par
hannnnahhhh: And now you've stalled me long enough\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:42:21am\par
hannnnahhhh: So it's all stopping\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:43:22am\par
hannnnahhhh: Nothing more from me now. Seeya.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:43:32am\par
 Teslaman: No, I'm glad everyone can see what I deal with when I do talk to you.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:45:29am\par
hannnnahhhh: You're crazy. Youre legit crazy. I have no issue with my pictures. I have issue with you caterorgorically stalking me which everyone can see you do\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:46:19am\par
 Teslaman: No I am not on here all day everyday. More like 5 min a day, if that, on average. I'd like it pointed out where I have ever lied about talking to you. You are certainly not my whole life, lol. The pictures really depend on when I see it. Sometimes it's around the same time, other times it's much later. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:46:41am\par
hannnnahhhh: You have them up 5 minutes after I put one up. We made a bet on it last night.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:47:29am\par
hannnnahhhh: No you come on here saying I'm a feminest crazy person \u-10179?\u-8702?\u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:47:32am\par
 Teslaman: According to you, that doesn't make it true though. You might want to revisit what stalking is, because by your definition, everyone who follows others on social media is a stalker, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:48:14am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah, because I have seen what you say and you fit the bill. I'm not the only one who says so by far.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:48:26am\par
hannnnahhhh: No. You don't follow me on anything. You stalk me and steal my pictures to put up on a website because you have nothing else to do. You go on my friends fbs and steal pictures from that\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:48:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: You try and cause as much drama as you can because you're insane. It's been 13 years. Let it go man. Let it go\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:49:26am\par
 Teslaman: Lol, yes, that previous picture I did, because it was like after 1am or such and I was still on the PC. The ones today, took much longer, like the following night or so.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:49:53am\par
hannnnahhhh: I'm sorry I don't want to be stalked by someone online who speaks about me every single day of their life for the last 13 years\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:50:51am\par
hannnnahhhh: Like i said I'm quite happy to talk to anyone about it all! I have my own screenshots too!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:51:54am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah, insane it couldn't possibly be any other reason, lol. I'll let it go when amends are made. That's great, because nothing I've said on here contradicts what I've said to you. I can't say the same for you.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:52:01am\par
hannnnahhhh: What about the email you sent after you had fake messaged luke saying oh you know we don't want anyone knowing where she lives if you don't send me stuff \u-10179?\u-8695?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:52:21am\par
hannnnahhhh: I DON'T SPEAK TO YOU YOU FRUIT CAKE LOL\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:53:31am\par
hannnnahhhh: Oh I made a website and she didn't do what I want wah wah wah so now I'm going to stalk her and send pictures covered in cum with her kids cut out. If you think that's normal I just don't know\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:53:37am\par
 Teslaman: We haven't spoken since like April, no. That's not what I said at all actually, you both took that whole thing as a threat when it wasn't and themunted and plenty of others knew about that at the time.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:54:19am\par
 Teslaman: Strawman again, assigning reasons that aren't true.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 7:59:38am\par
themunted: @Teslaman @hannnnahhhh ah guys, I'm sure there wasn't any blackmail going on. When reading text only its hard to understand the meaning, Something innocent might be taken a different way\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:04:05am\par
hannnnahhhh: Why keep bugging me though\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:04:09am\par
hannnnahhhh: Like fuck off.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:04:31am\par
hannnnahhhh: You literally stalk me\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:04:51am\par
hannnnahhhh: You appear to know more about me and my life than I do myself\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:05:55am\par
hannnnahhhh: You must literally sit on my fb waiting for a picture change\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:07:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: According to you I am a feminest housewife who is upset by everything \u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:09:35am\par
 Teslaman: I haven't talked to you since like April, so how am I bugging you? Just ignore this place if you care so little. Yes, I've seen plenty when I wanted an explanation for everything you had said. It all makes sense now.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:10:04am\par
hannnnahhhh: So fuck off and leave me alone.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:10:33am\par
hannnnahhhh: My fb has gone as of today anyway with a new account so you'll be dried up for pictures I'm afraid\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:12:12am\par
 Teslaman: I'm always hopeful that some day you'd make amends, so I'll be around, but you're free to just ignore me. Sure, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:13:27am\par
hannnnahhhh: Amends for what. The fact you haven't got what you wanted? Get a grip people move on with their lives. You're just stuck in the past\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:14:41am\par
 Teslaman: We've gone over that countless times and it's all laid out on the site for everyone to read. I'm not explaining it again.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:14:53am\par
hannnnahhhh: Yes. Your lies are\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:15:37am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah, just negate facts as "lies", makes it so easy.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:17:26am\par
hannnnahhhh: There's no facts. You use conversations I had with you 9 years ago and make it out like it was yesterday\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:17:58am\par
hannnnahhhh: You tried to cause drama between me and someone else on here because I got on better with him and you got upset. You're just obsessed and it's scary\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:20:18am\par
hannnnahhhh: Anyway. Happy for anyone else to message me. I have everything I need. Bye.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:22:35am\par
 Teslaman: Conversations are facts, lol. Also they span more recent times as well, which we've gone over before. I didn't try to cause drama, I was sick of knowing what he said that was in total contradiction to what he told you, yet I was the bad one. I'm obsessed with facts and can't stand people making up crap that isn't true.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:23:18am\par
hannnnahhhh: And people move on with their mindset from conversations they had nearly a decade ago\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:23:36am\par
hannnnahhhh: As you have been told countless times\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:24:18am\par
 Teslaman: And then they continue to lie about being that same way for years to the person. Totally acceptable, yeah. /sarc\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:24:49am\par
hannnnahhhh: Now go away. There's nothing else happening as you've been made aware on multiple occasions and stop stalking me.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:25:30am\par
hannnnahhhh: I'm talking about me! Yes I may have said in 2008 that I might be interested. It's 2017!!!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:26:10am\par
hannnnahhhh: People's minds change and that doesn't mean you get to categorically stalk and slander them because you didn't get what you want\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:27:30am\par
 Teslaman: Always the same conversation. Screencaps go all the way into 2015 when we had our issues.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:28:29am\par
hannnnahhhh: There were no issues....just that you wouldn't stop going on at me and me asking politely until I flipped out\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:28:44am\par
hannnnahhhh: Re read them\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:29:41am\par
hannnnahhhh: Now once again. I'm going. Stop stalking me.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:29:45am\par
 Teslaman: Maybe you should re-read them, because I know all too well what the issue was.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:30:12am\par
 Teslaman: I can't stop doing something that I'm not doing to begin with, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:31:41am\par
hannnnahhhh: Good lord you're just insane honestly. Stop. StEaling my pictures. Stop emailing me weird messages about how great i am\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:32:15am\par
hannnnahhhh: Again. I'm going. You need to leave me alone. Keep your site up I couldn't care less. But stop stalking me\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:32:31am\par
 Teslaman: I haven't been emailing you since April.  You also can't steal public pictures, that's impossible.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:33:48am\par
hannnnahhhh: Listen. Stop being obsessed with me. It's scary and annoying. Goodbye.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:36:29am\par
 Teslaman: Silly things scare you, so that's no surprise. Liking your stuff isn't some weird obsession.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:37:53am\par
hannnnahhhh: Stealing pictures with my children in cropping them out and fake Cumming over them for a reaction is fucking weird and scary\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:38:49am\par
 Teslaman: As I said, that's not the reason I did it, I just didn't care if it did.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:39:17am\par
hannnnahhhh: You literally said above I knew that would get a reaction\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:40:02am\par
 Teslaman: Yeah and I didn't care. That doesn't mean that's the reason why I did it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:40:26am\par
hannnnahhhh: And that's gross\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:41:20am\par
hannnnahhhh: ANYWAY goodbye for the eighth time. Please leave me alone or this year I really will be taking it further. Keep your site. Keep the pictures they don't bother me. You not leaving me alone does.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:42:14am\par
 Teslaman: No denying that, if there was another pic like that, then I would have used it instead.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:42:29am\par
 Teslaman: I have NOT contacted you since April when we were talking! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:43:45am\par
hannnnahhhh: NOT talking. Me asking you to leave me alone! Goodbye\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:45:05am\par
 Teslaman: You said keep the site and pictures, so besides talking to you, I don't know how else I could be bothering you.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:46:33am\par
hannnnahhhh: ....by stealing my pictures. I think I've made that pretty clear. That's the only way you keep people on here. If they want to see pictures I can just add them!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:48:13am\par
 Teslaman: Well you haven't cared to make amends, ever add me, or anything, so I don't see why I should care if you don't like me sharing public pictures.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:49:28am\par
hannnnahhhh: And there we have it. Carry on your tantrum.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:50:32am\par
 Teslaman: That's not a tantrum, just a statement of fact. You have never cared about the things you said to me, so I fail to see why I should care now about some public pictures that anyone can see anyways.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:52:40am\par
hannnnahhhh: You don't get what you want and have a tantrum for 10 years...and I thought the terrible twos were bad.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:54:05am\par
 Teslaman: Strawman, again. You're constantly fixated on that "explanation", like if you say it enough times, it will magically become true. Also, people don't just keep coming back here for a few new pictures. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:54:58am\par
hannnnahhhh: What's that got to do with anything? I'm talking about you. Not other people\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 8:56:50am\par
 Teslaman: I was replying a bit delayed to you saying: "That's the only way you keep people on here."\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:00:06am\par
hannnnahhhh: You're so narcissistic it's unreal\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:03:20am\par
 Teslaman: You've said that before and I'm absolutely not. For one thing, I'm not the one who takes selfies constantly. I also posted up a test which does reflect my personality nicely. You think you know me, but it's clear that you don't have a clue. You judge a person's personality, when that doesn't reflect who they actually are.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:09:09am\par
hannnnahhhh: Pot. Kettle.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:11:44am\par
 Teslaman: No, not at all. I go by what you have said to me and what you have done. That is not personality. I had friends in school across all social levels, precisely because personality is not what I go by.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:11:45am\par
hannnnahhhh: Yeah you're a right wing narcassist lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:11:57am\par
 Teslaman: You constantly make assumptions for the reasons that I do things and \par
refuse to acknowledge any other reason, even when I tell you repeatedly.\par
The things you say about me, everyone who knows me IRL would laugh at \par
the absurdity. Am I OCD about shit? Yeah. As they like to say these days\par
"autist", lol. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:12:48am\par
 Teslaman: I'm not right wing, or a narcissist. I'm classical liberal, aka Libertarian.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:13:10am\par
hannnnahhhh: What are you even talking about\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:13:38am\par
hannnnahhhh: no you really ain't lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:13:50am\par
 Teslaman: Classical liberals, like Thomas Jefferson, would be considered right wing by radical leftists like you.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:14:15am\par
hannnnahhhh: Yes for the lefties!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:14:56am\par
 Teslaman: Lefties are failing the world over now because we're fed up with the insanity.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:15:18am\par
hannnnahhhh: No you are the insane ones lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:15:20am\par
 Teslaman: Gen Z is swinging hard back to conservative value.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:15:29am\par
hannnnahhhh: Just need to read your page articles to see that\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:16:04am\par
 Teslaman: Facts aren't insane, but it gives you a feeling of superiority to dismiss them as such, so I get it.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:16:39am\par
hannnnahhhh: No it doesn't. I'm just not a prick that thinks I'm right about everything and everyone should do things my way\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:16:43am\par
hannnnahhhh: You however\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:18:24am\par
 Teslaman: That's another strawman, you're really good at those, lol. I would never say that I'm right about everything and no, Libertarian means that you let others live as they wish. That doesn't mean I will agree with them and I shouldn't be forced to do so, which is what your side demands.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:18:44am\par
hannnnahhhh: Hannah: I have decided I don't want to do porn.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:18:59am\par
hannnnahhhh: You: No. I'm going to stalk you\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:19:04am\par
hannnnahhhh: Amazing logic there\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:21:05am\par
 Teslaman: There you go again with the BS. I think everyone can read the screencap conversations on here that show that was not the case. You lied and led me on for years that it was still an option, then tell me that was all BS and that you never intended to do it. That's also subtracting all the stuff you said about me, which is what I'm the most upset about.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:21:23am\par
hannnnahhhh: No we had a conversation years ago. .....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:21:59am\par
hannnnahhhh: Which you seem to think happened yesterday\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:22:16am\par
hannnnahhhh: Oh I'm pregnant. Ok do pregnant porn LOL\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:22:35am\par
 Teslaman: Facts are facts, time is irrelevant to them.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:22:51am\par
 Teslaman: I never said that, actually my reaction was quite the opposite if you recall.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:22:55am\par
hannnnahhhh: Are you still going to be doing this when I'm 80\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:23:02am\par
hannnnahhhh: Fuck off \u-10179?\u-8702?\u-10179?\u-8702?\u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:23:13am\par
 Teslaman: I don't know, are you still not going to care?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:23:34am\par
hannnnahhhh: Only thing I care about is you categorically invading my private life\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:23:44am\par
hannnnahhhh: Which you won't stop doing so I'll have to make you\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:24:24am\par
 Teslaman: Guess that answers that question. I hate to break it to you, but facebook is not private.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:24:54am\par
hannnnahhhh: You're so obsessed I actually feel bad for you\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:26:40am\par
hannnnahhhh: Is there honestly nothing else going on in your life other than trying to get a reaction out of me\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:28:18am\par
 Teslaman: I'm actually not, but you're conflating things as usual. If I'm obsessed about anything, it's getting you to show you care, because I really don't want to believe that you are that cold. Of course, as I said, I'm rarely on here. I haven't even written up everything and it has been years. I think that shows how little I have been active with the site.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:29:23am\par
hannnnahhhh: I get messages from people saying am I ok because all you do is slag me off on here lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:29:36am\par
hannnnahhhh: And anyone that comes on you think is me lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:30:22am\par
hannnnahhhh: This weird projected relationship you think we have. We don't have...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:30:25am\par
 Teslaman: That doesn't even slightly shock me, because there are lots of little beta suckups who would clean your toilet with their tongue for a chance to speak with you, lmao.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:30:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: Yes and they are all lovely and normal\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:30:55am\par
hannnnahhhh: Say what they say and then wish me well and leave\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:31:43am\par
 Teslaman: They are being fake, or don't actually know you, lol. Well it's easy to be paranoid when you constantly use fake accounts.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:32:08am\par
hannnnahhhh: You don't know me \u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:32:10am\par
 Teslaman: The only reason I've banned you off of here before was because of that fake BS.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:33:04am\par
hannnnahhhh: I don't use fake accounts because I have a life. ..\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:33:10am\par
 Teslaman: You just admitted earlier that I know you better than you know yourself, lol. Lets put it this way, I know enough.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:33:20am\par
hannnnahhhh: You don't know shit\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:33:52am\par
 Teslaman: Yes you do, you emailed me in April from a couple of them.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:34:07am\par
hannnnahhhh: Hence you got so annoyed I made another friend on here who I spoke to \u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:34:22am\par
 Teslaman: You just used another one on here the other day. Nan's anal cyst or whatever, lmao.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:34:43am\par
hannnnahhhh: Yeah and you blocked me\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:34:54am\par
 Teslaman: Strawman again.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:34:59am\par
 Teslaman: Yes, I just said that, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:35:04am\par
hannnnahhhh: Nah that's facrazy\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:35:07am\par
hannnnahhhh: Fact\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:35:44am\par
 Teslaman: No, it's not. I actually never wanted to be friends.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:36:47am\par
 Teslaman: I was just very annoyed by the fact that you would trust a guy who told me that his intentions were manipulative and lies, but not trust me when I hadn't done any of that.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:37:01am\par
hannnnahhhh: No you didn't. You wanTed pictures and when you didn't get them threw a massive tantrump\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:37:30am\par
 Teslaman: It was fucked up and I wasn't even mentioning it until you asked me to tell you why I had a problem with him.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:37:41am\par
hannnnahhhh: Tantrum but tantrump fit's lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:37:48am\par
hannnnahhhh: No. Lies\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:38:30am\par
 Teslaman: I never asked you for any of that, not until this year when you asked me what I wanted. Again, that wasn't the reason and we've been over that countless times, but as always, you don't believe me, even when I'm saying it in public.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:38:42am\par
 Teslaman: Not lies.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:39:07am\par
hannnnahhhh: Oh hi Hannah I made a site and you didn't want to do it. Send me pictures or I am going to keep stealing yours and invade your privacy\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:39:11am\par
hannnnahhhh: Nice and normal\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:39:55am\par
hannnnahhhh: Absolute keyboard warrior\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:39:57am\par
 Teslaman: Another strawman. I never said that, nor is that the intention.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:40:04am\par
hannnnahhhh: Wtf is a strawman\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:40:24am\par
hannnnahhhh: Leave me alone then!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:40:31am\par
 Teslaman: Google. Keyboard warrior? lol No I'd happily say it to your face.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:41:42am\par
 Teslaman: You're the one who is bothered by people saving and sharing your public pictures, something that everyone has done on the internet since it was born, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:41:51am\par
hannnnahhhh: No. You\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:42:07am\par
hannnnahhhh: No one else has a picture I put up within minutes\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:42:25am\par
hannnnahhhh: You're obsessed and it's very scary\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:43:19am\par
hannnnahhhh: So leave me alone. Keep your site up I couldn't give a flying fuck but you need to leave me alone personally\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:43:24am\par
 Teslaman: That's not obsession, that's efficiency. And like I said, that's pure random chance. I could see it and wait until later, but why bother?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:44:10am\par
hannnnahhhh: Well wait till you see my efficiency this year. I've spent a year being very efficiant\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:44:31am\par
hannnnahhhh: Why bother at all. Leave me alone\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:44:36am\par
 Teslaman: I can't control what you are concerned with. I haven't messaged you since we last spoke, that's what any normal person considers a personal bother.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:44:53am\par
hannnnahhhh: No one thinks this is normal\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:45:44am\par
hannnnahhhh: Sitting on someone's fb waiting for them to change a picture so you can add it to your collection is obsessive\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:45:44am\par
 Teslaman: Again, because you don't care about the things you've said, so I'm certainly not going to care that you're bothered by someone sharing public pictures.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:46:17am\par
 Teslaman: As I said, I'm not sitting there, the software grabs it when I'm off chopping a tree or some shit.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:46:25am\par
hannnnahhhh: I've not said anything bad apart from asking you to leave me alone and when you wouldn't swearing at you. Because you simply won't fuck off\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:46:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: Oh yes I'm sure you're chopping trees \u-10179?\u-8702?\u-10179?\u-8702?\u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:47:09am\par
hannnnahhhh: Are they to burn in your hannah shrine?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:48:00am\par
 Teslaman: Then you need to seriously re-read the conversations, because you absolutely have. You even had the nerve to say that you didn't remember a conversation that ended us speaking entirely. That's a truly screwed memory there.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:48:26am\par
hannnnahhhh: No my memory is just fine. And yes I have all of them in a nice file\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:48:27am\par
 Teslaman: Yes if you check far enough back in chat, there is a picture of me doing so. I have a very large pile of wood that I have cut.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:49:04am\par
 Teslaman: No hannah shrines though, that's ridiculous.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:49:27am\par
hannnnahhhh: Oh. Well it seems we are on one here?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:49:35am\par
 Teslaman: Good, then re-read them and learn something. Maybe you'll have a Grinch heart moment or something.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:50:14am\par
hannnnahhhh: Was the grinch categorically stalked for 13 years?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:50:58am\par
 Teslaman: This not a shrine, I added links to what a fansite is since you're apparently clueless on that. Of course, it's not a fansite anymore, more like a PSA.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:51:29am\par
 Teslaman: Another strawman, no one has stalked you for 13 years, that's utter BS.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:52:05am\par
hannnnahhhh: You have you fucking weirdo\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:52:38am\par
 Teslaman: No, I haven't and I take weirdo as a compliment. I sure don't want to be what passes for normal these days.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:53:03am\par
hannnnahhhh: Well you're really not normal\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:53:11am\par
hannnnahhhh: The problem is, bossing people around like you own them is Queen level arrogance.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:53:23am\par
hannnnahhhh: That is my favourite line anyone has eve said about me\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:54:08am\par
hannnnahhhh: Let's stalk someone online after she's said no and keep it going for all eternity. I don't know why she won't talk to me \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:54:09am\par
 Teslaman: Thanks! I'm glad to not be normal. I'm glad you like that one. That's true, when you tell people what to do and what not to do. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:55:06am\par
hannnnahhhh: The fact you put a picture up with kids cropped out and put cum over it is quite frankly the most disturbing thing I think I've probably seen\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:55:34am\par
 Teslaman: I guess all the people on your old instagram are stalkers too then, lmao. Following someone is what social media is all about. Don't want to be followed, then either don't be popular, or don't be on it, but you can't control what people like,\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:56:01am\par
hannnnahhhh: You don't follow me. I've blocked you on everything because you scare me with your obsession level\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:56:09am\par
 Teslaman: Lol, then you are seriously sheltered, which we know you aren't.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:56:16am\par
hannnnahhhh: So that to most normal people would be a big oh I'll leave her alone\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:56:42am\par
hannnnahhhh: I really don't think anyone would think that's acceptable\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:56:46am\par
hannnnahhhh: Really I don't\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:57:35am\par
hannnnahhhh: Why don't you ask someone\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:58:54am\par
hannnnahhhh: I made a picture of hannah with cum over her face and cropped her kids out of it. But hey everyone thinks that's totally normal\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:59:05am\par
 Teslaman: You only blocked me when I asked you repeatedly to do so, because I couldn't believe you were serious. That is even on here. I also blocked your email too, so that doesn't mean much no does it, lol. I also haven't messaged you since April when we spoke, so that is me leaving you alone. Doesn't mean that I can't enjoy your pics and shit, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 9:59:19am\par
hannnnahhhh: You're so gross\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:00:12am\par
hannnnahhhh: Fuck me I'm done with this. I look forward to still being on here when I'm 80 with pictures you're sharing of me enjoying a nursing home party because you just can't get over me. Fucking hell\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:02:43am\par
 Teslaman: The kids were already cropped out, but as I said, it was the only matching picture and it was a joke anyways, not meant to be serious. That's clear by my reaction. If you had cropped the kids out, then I wouldn't have known either. You're equating things to make it sound as if it had an intention it didn't.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:03:38am\par
 Teslaman: Well maybe one day you'll read over what you said before and realize how horrid it was.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:06:00am\par
hannnnahhhh: You have software that picks up what I post \u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:06:11am\par
hannnnahhhh: But you're not obsessed. Ok matey\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:08:22am\par
 Teslaman: Gee, I can't imagine why I would do such a thing, it must only be explained by obsession. It couldn't possibly be because I'm happy to do it, given what was said and done.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:08:44am\par
hannnnahhhh: ...what are you fucking talking about. Leave me the fuck alone\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:09:19am\par
 Teslaman: I don't know how that was hard to understand, but ok.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:09:36am\par
 Teslaman: You're the one still on here, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:10:06am\par
hannnnahhhh: Yeah bye. Fucking leave me alone or I will make you. Honestly we have all had enough now.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:12:51am\par
 Teslaman: Had enough of someone sharing public pictures? That is so silly.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Dec 28, 10:17:19am\par
 Teslaman: All I've wanted for the past few years was for you to care about the shit you said and did, but you can't and won't. So anything you want, is irrelevant to me until that changes. End of.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 31, 12:46:35am\par
 Teslaman:  Happy New Year! \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Dec 31, 6:39:33pm\par
 Teslaman:   \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 3, 2:23:02pm\par
courier: Feliz a\'f1o nuevo @Teslaman let's see what 2018 brings \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 3, 11:51:25pm\par
 Teslaman: Thanks! Indeed, hope springs eternal. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 4, 6:24:46am\par
anon8770: She was the real Hannah?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 4, 6:45:41am\par
kaba: weird little altercation, hope she's okay\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 4, 8:54:27am\par
 Teslaman: @anon8770 Yes\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 4, 10:10:35am\par
anon1918: Hard not to feel sorry for Hannah. People should really let this go.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 4, 11:53:56am\par
 Teslaman: @anon1918 aka Longtimefan27, who dropped the "misogyny" gem. No, it's actually quite easy to not, considering. Outrageous.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 7, 2:41:58pm\par
letype: hi\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 7, 2:43:05pm\par
letype: do you make more video?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 7, 3:02:58pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Omg... wait... That hannah is the hannah from the videos and pictures???\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 7, 3:03:25pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Wow... I'd love to meet her!!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 2:57:38pm\par
gonzaluskax: I think he's just a troll posing as a Hannah\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 2:59:12pm\par
gonzaluskax: We all know that Hannah likes to show her naked body, that's why she was one of the first to show her body through webcam, it makes her hot to know that we see her naked\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:03:58pm\par
gonzaluskax: I would also love to meet her \u-10179?\u-8691?, because her fans owe us that in her holidays she should come to our cities to visit us, surely we would all have a great time with her \u-10179?\u-8696?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:21:01pm\par
 Teslaman: I wish that was a troll and I know there's no proof as usual, but that's her.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:24:27pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Mr Teslaman.... Sorry to bother you... I was trying to read all that stuff that you wrote on this website.. and I kind of understood a little bit.. but how come you got involved in all that?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:25:19pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: I am a fan of Hannah and reading all that it is sort of dissapointing \u-10179?\u-8687?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:53:22pm\par
gonzaluskax: If she is Hannah really what she would have to do is to recognize her past what she did and what she continues to do, her last nude photos do not think they are from long ago\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:53:41pm\par
gonzaluskax: She says that people's minds change but she keeps taking nude photos year after year continuously\par
is the same girl who revolutionized the internet recording naked on webcam but does not want to admit that she loves to show herself naked to the whole world\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:54:29pm\par
gonzaluskax: It's a shame because as the first webcam girl in the world could have taken a lot of money out of it, being a porngraphic actress is not bad either, many girls are and nothing happens, many even have husbands and children\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 3:54:45pm\par
gonzaluskax: I'm sure he masturbates thinking that @Teslaman downloads his photos, but will not recognize him publicly\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 4:18:22pm\par
 Teslaman: @SpiderManAlpha: Oh you're no bother.  Yeah in hindsight I should have stayed at arms length like I had intended. I got drawn in by the charm though, which admittedly you're not seeing any of right now, lol. The lack of trust towards only me, is really why I did get involved though, that drove me nuts for years, before things went south around late 2013. @gonzaluskax: Yeah, there was a conversation on here a little while back that revealed why things went the way that they have.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 4:37:26pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Oh man!!! Not good... I had a mental picture of her being so different\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 4:37:56pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Like... really nice girl to hang out with!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 4:41:34pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: I have a question Mr Teslaman.... does she still working as a escort or something or she move on and now she is like a business woman and owns her own cruice company?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 4:46:23pm\par
anon9350: her attitude reminds me of this one ex porn star Jessie Andrews who's trying to rebrand and a instegram girl she acctually blocks anyone who mentions her porn past\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 4:57:14pm\par
 Teslaman: @SpiderManAlpha: That's what I thought too, based on her old stuff. I'm fairly certain that she has never been, or would be, an escort. Those profiles were fake and she gets offended by the suggestion. @anon9350: Pretty much.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:26:59pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Ok.... good to know!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:28:28pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Well, at least I managed something that not many people have done.... I got a hello back from her!! Not that anyone cares but still that was awesome!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:29:08pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: To me it was the equivalent of talking to Remy Lacroix!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:29:29pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: She is my other platonic love\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:29:40pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Maybe one!! Maybe one day!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:30:15pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: Btw... I literally have no idea how I ended up here!!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:31:01pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: It was something about some cupons.... and then Hannah Amateur something something and this is so weird!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:31:44pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: I ended up talking to a transexual about video games\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:32:38pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: A lady (which I don't think she was) was trying to sale me her nude pictures... and I don't even know her!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:33:07pm\par
SpiderManAlpha: And also a guy who claims to be a talking dog from the future!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 5:37:29pm\par
 Teslaman: Sounds like your average day on tumblr. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 6:09:04pm\par
spidermanalpha: Pretty much!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Mon Jan 8, 6:09:08pm\par

bigfan: So the rumours are true! She's back! Kind of? I have a question Teslaman....how did you get hold of these pics? If they are hacked then surely she could sue your ass! Since she doesn't seem to be very happy with you! \u-10179?\u-8702?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 17, 7:51:57pm\par

anon8875: Cannot find any vids bar 2\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 19, 3:49:31pm\par
 Teslaman: @JustAnotherHanFan Good one. @anon8875 Only 1 new vid, old vids are everywhere.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 20, 5:24:23pm\par
anon2770: not looking that hot now lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Tue Jan 23, 5:49:37pm\par
anon7072: is the new vid just her playing with her tits?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par

anon6900: just wanted to say damn Hannah is hot as fuck, stunning and love the pictures and updates \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Wed Jan 24, 6:20:22pm\par
 Teslaman: Nice counterbalance to that other anon's unnecessary comment.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 25, 1:55:36pm\par
anon6026: @Teslaman you mention another fan site you used to run for Natasha. Don't think I ever saw her, was she as hot as Hannah? Any vids online of her?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 25, 1:56:38pm\par
anon6120: I trust your judgement when it comes to hot birds so I'm interested in checking her out! \u-10179?\u-8704?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 25, 5:05:24pm\par
 Teslaman: Ha, well it depends if we're alike. Personally, I can find a "Plain Jane" to be way hotter than a "Perfect 10", since perfection is just boring to me. I want character. Which btw, is largely why I have always loathed makeup. I want to see your face, not some boring vacant face that resembles some fake sex doll, lol. It's like the real life version of photoshop, totally lame.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Thu Jan 25, 5:05:44pm\par
 Teslaman: That said, yeah Natasha's vids are around under Tashasky/Tasha Sky. Here's one: https://xhamster.com/videos/tasha-sky-on-webcam-923970 In crude dude speak, to me she is a "Would marry", while Hannah is a "Would fuck". Which is why I find the "obsession" comments so funny. It's like she can't accept that my upset with her has nothing to do with being some jilted Hannah worshiper. I built the site for her fans, not for myself. Anyways...\par

ruudiikeda: how dp i become a member?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 26, 3:11:17am\par
ruudiikeda: i just did... its cool...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 26, 3:16:07am\par
ruudiikeda: teslaman ... you are one cool dude... so much material here to digest and understand your story with hannah... on the face of it looks like you have fallen out big time... pity ... i would love to get more of her material... i guess if she has two kids that must restrict what sex can be made public... but she is horny as hell...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Fri Jan 26, 3:38:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Ah, well we only have new material as a result of that falling out. The whole thing is quite strange to me, since on one hand, the leaker still says to do what I want with them, but on the other hand, says they really regret it and wish they could take it back. This is why I just ignore everything that gets said to me, since it's apparently all BS, lol. Yeah I never knew how conservative so many Brit women are about porn. It's so contradictory to how they are otherwise. Here, it's quite common for pornstars to have kids, because naturally they are the total opposite of conservative, lol. So that was quite surprising to me. https://www.thedailybeast.com/stormy-daniels-on-being-a-porn-star-mom\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 2:30:43am\par
ruudiikeda: its strange really, they are happy to go to beach and flash their tits and go on holiday and screw around... but porn and sex is a big no... i was working in germany a while back and used to regularly go to health clubs where in the sauna you stripped right off... it was cool.. really healthy nothing else... in the uk.. no got to keep your bits covered... sad.. i remember in germany i went to a sauna in the hotel i was stopping in.. nobody in there... then after 5 minutes this delicious lady joined me.. after 45 minutes of pleasant chat we parted... the next morning at breakfast i noticed a lady starung at me... as she approached i said to her ... Oh... apologies ... I didnt recognize you with your clothes on... im blind as a bat without my glasses which of course you dont wear in saunas!!!\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 2:51:16am\par
ruudiikeda: not sure what caused the dupe or how to delete\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 4:15:25am\par
 Teslaman: Sorted. Almost 16min apart too, that's odd. Copy/Paste?  Yeah that nudity would be wasted on me too without my glasses, lol. Oh that's normal for here too. Nudity is pretty rare here, it's more of a fringe thing like the pornstars are. I meant that within that group of very uninhibited people it's quite strange to be so conservative. I mean, that view is normal to me since I'm personally pretty conservative. I basically wouldn't be caught dead nude outside the shower, haha. But coming from people like Hannah, it's just bizarre.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 4:15:41am\par
 Teslaman: Her getting so easily offended, the shaming, mocking of and stunning ignorance of sexual activities/preferences...I expect that from my uptight Grandmother, or some Nun, but certainly not from someone as "liberal" as her. For example, did people catch that she poked fun at having a preggo fetish? I don't, total turn off to me, but I don't judge/mock people for liking it. Pretty weird to me, but whatever floats your boat. Certainly plenty of women willing to cater to it, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 10:11:53am\par
ruudiikeda: @Teslaman it floats my boat ... but then i am easily aroused... i like all sorts of preggo stuff.. must revisit where she poked fun at it... presumably when she was pregnant...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 10:18:00am\par
ruudiikeda: @teslaman ... in the USA there are a few girls who really did it for me and now have pretty much disappeared and I wondered if they were still likely to make a comeback... can you comment perhaps?? model gabe did some great peep stuff and recently seems to be showing a lot of pussy... perhaps hc soon???\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 10:21:49am\par
ruudiikeda: another girl who now masturbates and dildos was that dancing babe Christina model ... i thought i saw a lesbian video but there are a number look like her\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 10:23:41am\par
ruudiikeda: its a shame that Kacey has retired ... she was superb,,, i read though that she had to dope herself up to get through the scenes... spotted her on facebook but that seems to have gone\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 10:30:32am\par
ruudiikeda: one final cute in and out gil was hurricane Barbie.... so young and sweet... i guess porn didnt work for her...\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 10:39:05am\par
ruudiikeda: @teslaman ... i notice that there are two other anon lurkers.... anyway... im guessing you are a pretty good tech person....stion for you... ifinding it difficult to read this chat stuff. my eyes are shite.... and my browser struggles to scroll chat up to start reading then press next to read next post... can you export the chat to text and share with me?? ... thanks if you can....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 5:27:19pm\par
 Teslaman: Ah, the poking fun was this last December when she came on to do her usual. First time was in private, in early 2017. Since she mentioned it, yeah allegedly she popped out another one not long ago. And sure thing, I've already been backing up the chat to text, but I need to update it. Oh the lurkers still show? That's odd, I have that turned off.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 6:16:20pm\par
 Teslaman: Nah I can't really comment on those chicks. I've never really followed any porn, or anything for that matter, lol. It can be many years before I ever even check to see if my fav singers have a new album out. I'm like, "Oh the band split 6 years ago...damn", haha. That's another odd thing about me. I mostly just sporadically save stuff, or go off on an investigation when the mood strikes me, lol. I occasionally like challenges to finding stuff that is intentionally hidden. So yeah, I use search tools to track down all those pics of Hannah on occasion, because it's like a fun Easter Egg hunt, lol. I do recognize Christina, but I just randomly have some of her vids somewhere.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 7:01:40pm\par
ruudiikeda: that's cool teslaman... this site should only be bout Hannah ... although i motice the other chick you gave a link to re marriage or fuck... i already have Emily pinpointed i think... using truthfinder... wish there was something like that in the uk... until i read your info i had Hannah surnme wrong... sad... need to start reading around the posts of her vids....\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sat Jan 27, 7:47:53pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh yeah no worries, other chicks are fine. I just don't know much, unless it's random amateurs in those "local area" collections. Ah, yeah those sites are useful for the curious, it's nice having actual names, but also pretty messed up since it allows all the wrong people to very easily track you down. I opt out whenever I see one. The old days were simple if you wanted to be unlisted in the local directory, but now it's a real pita and global.\par

anon7170: is this chat still live?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 4:23:28pm\par
 Teslaman: I guess so. \par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:00:05pm\par
titan8: lol\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:00:29pm\par
titan8: So Is Hannah still around\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:00:42pm\par
titan8: i am so confused by it all now\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:12:16pm\par
 Teslaman: Well, basically nothing has changed, she just now wants you to message her so she can tell you what a "lying, disgusting human being" I am, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:13:11pm\par
titan8: But you have done nothing wrong to her? have you?\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:16:59pm\par
 Teslaman: Well, according to her, making the site in the first place was doing something wrong to her. So it depends what you mean, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:17:59pm\par
titan8: as in you have never met or dated her? and all you have done is put everything that is in the public domain into one place for us\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:18:17pm\par
titan8: you don't make money off anyone for her content\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:20:12pm\par
 Teslaman: Right, exactly. Yeah, this place has been in the negative for a long time as far as money goes, which is why I tried a paywall at one point.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:21:40pm\par
anon9753: was there anymore of her off that guy stuff you kept just for you\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:22:27pm\par
 Teslaman: The leaker? Nah. Anything else I have is just normal pics.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:23:14pm\par
anon9753: should put them up\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:25:10pm\par
 Teslaman: Nah, they are private ones.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:25:24pm\par
anon9753: oh with her family\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:25:28pm\par
anon9753: is she married\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:26:35pm\par
 Teslaman: Oh a mix really, I just mean obtained privately. I dunno there.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:27:54pm\par
anon9753: so she would know who shared\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:30:09pm\par
 Teslaman: Not sure there. First batch was ones I saved direct from the brief moment that she actually added me in 2008 and I've never put those out. Others were given, but I dunno if she'd know from who.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:32:30pm\par
 Teslaman: For all I know, she's the one who gave them to me, lol. Never know who these people are.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:33:00pm\par
anon9753: true mate\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:38:34pm\par
 Teslaman: Maybe she just wants to trash me since that's how she views what I say on here. That's not the intention though and certainly doesn't help matters, but ah well, nothing I can do about that.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:39:21pm\par
 Teslaman: Doesn't matter what I say, it always gets taken wrong, lol.\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:40:48pm\par
anon9753: its women mate we all know what they are like we just never call them out on it\par
--------------------------------------------------\par
Sun Jan 28, 5:42:17pm\par
 Teslaman: Haha, true. I can't help it though, I'm too old school.        \par
