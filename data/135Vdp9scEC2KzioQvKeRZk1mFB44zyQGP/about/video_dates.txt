HANNAH VIDEO DATES
by Eska Moron
for Teslaman (updated by Teslaman)

FACT:  Some of the Hannah videos in WMV format contain "file markers".
FACT:  You can see the file markers with some versions of WMV Player.
       When you choose a file marker, it jumps to a corresponding point in
       the video.
FACT:  The point that you jump to when you choose a file marker usually
       seems to be the beginning of one of the edited-together segments.
FACT:  Many of the file markers are in the format of dates and times.
FACT:  There are two different formats of date and time, Format A and
       Format B.
FACT:  Format A seems to use the European convention DD/MM/YY and the
       24-hour clock.
FACT:  Format B seems to use the American convention MM/DD/YY and AM/PM
       times. (Hannah and Luke broke up before 3 November 2005, so the
       file marker 3/11/2005 must mean March 11 2005.)
FACT:  The dates and times are consistent with when the videos could have
       been filmed.

SPECULATIONS: Luke sometimes used video software that preserved the date
of each clip filmed. He then sometimes used editing software that
preserved the date and time of each clip as a "file marker" associated
with the clip. He used at least two different editing programs, that
preserved the date and time as file markers in two different formats.
 
Here are the videos that contain file markers, ordered by the dates and
times in the file markers.

Rubbing Oil All Over (pink belt):
4 file markers in Format A:
  20/03/2004 15:02 (20 March 2004, a Saturday afternoon)
  20/03/2004 15:03
  20/03/2004 15:04
  20/03/2004 15:04

Getting Pounded From Behind (pink belt):
2 file markers in Format A:
  20/03/2004 15:38 (20 March 2004, a Saturday afternoon)
  23/03/2004 15:54 (23 March 2004, a Tuesday afternoon; this marker marks
                    the last shot of Hannah lying on the bed with a pink
                    top on)

Giving Her Man Head (pink skirt):
2 file markers in Format A:
  16/04/2004 18:07 (16 April 2004, a Friday evening)
  16/04/2004 18:09

Sucking And Riding Her Man (pink skirt):
3 file markers in Format A:
  16/04/2004 18:12 (16 April 2004, a Friday evening)
  16/04/2004 18:12
  16/04/2004 18:12

Dancing And Striping In A Dark Setting (pink skirt):
4 file markers in Format A:
  16/04/2004 20:21 (16 April 2004, a Friday evening)
  16/04/2004 20:23
  16/04/2004 20:23
  16/04/2004 20:23

Dancing Seductively (black belt):
4 file markers in Format A:
  06/05/2004 09:54 (6 May 2004, a Thursday morning)
  06/05/2004 09:59
  06/05/2004 09:59
  06/05/2004 10:00

With Tail Dancing On The Bed:
3 file markers in Format A:
  11/08/2004 12:24 (11 August 2004, a Wednesday afternoon)
  11/08/2004 12:27
  16/05/2004 14:31 (16 May 2004, a Sunday afternoon; this marker marks the
                    last second or so, in the green room)

In A Sexy Outfit (WBW shoutout):
3 file markers in Format A:
  17/09/2004 21:09 (17 September 2004, a Friday evening)
  17/09/2004 21:10
  17/09/2004 21:13
The markers in this video reinforce the idea that the dates are accurate,
because the video was posted to WBW on September 18 2004, and Luke stated
in his message that it had been filmed the day before.

Hotel 3Some:
2 file markers in Format B:
  12/18/2004 8:13 PM (December 18 2004, a Saturday evening)
  12/18/2004 8:14 PM
This is a WMV, but it was edited with some software that does not preserve
dates as file markers. Given the other information about the hotel video,
probably it is from the end of 2004 or beginning of 2005.
Update: Confirmed from an original clip (23.WMV) with intact file markers.

In A Cowboy Hat:
1 file marker in Format B:
  3/7/2005 4:45 PM (probably March 7 2005, a Monday afternoon)

For John:
2 file markers in Format B:
  3/11/2005 11:04 PM (probably March 11 2005, a Friday evening)
  3/11/2005 11:06 PM

For Neil:
1 file marker in Format B:
  3/11/2005 11:06 PM (probably March 11 2005, a Friday evening)

For Rizien:
2 file markers in Format B:
  3/12/2005 12:03 AM (probably March 12 2005, early on a Saturday morning)
  3/12/2005 12:06 AM

The other videos (listed below) have no file markers. It's possible that
some versions of them might turn up that have file markers, but I have
never found any that do.

Paris Hilton Style (sucking / night vision):
This is an MPG and has no file markers.
Update: Earliest file date is Sunday, December 12, 2004, 9:56:48 PM

With A Black Hat On (hat, panties and trainers):
This is a WMV, but it was edited with some software that does not preserve
dates as file markers. The song ("All Falls Down" by Kanye West) is from
the album "The College Dropout", which came out on February 24, 2004, so
that's not much help since all the other videos are later than that. 
Update: Earliest file date is Saturday, October 16, 2004, 11:17:16 AM

Very Nice Teasing ("Big Weenie"):
This is a WMV, but it was edited with some software that does not preserve
dates as file markers. The song ("Big Weenie" by Eminem) is from the album
"Encore", which came out on November 12, 2004, so it was probably after that.
Update: Earliest file date is Tuesday, March 15, 2005, 2:14:38 PM

For tdawg:
This is a WMV, but it was edited with some software that does not preserve
dates as file markers. My guess is that it was filmed the same night as the 
other shoutout videos, the night of March 11/12 2005.

Showing Off Her Body:
This is a WMV, but it was edited with some software that does not preserve
dates as file markers. However, she is wearing exactly what she is wearing 
in the shoutout videos, so my guess is that it was filmed the same night, 
the night of March 11/12 2005.  Maybe this was a "generic" reward video not 
mentioning anyone's name.
Update: The WMV was from Karl's scam site and was likely made for him.
