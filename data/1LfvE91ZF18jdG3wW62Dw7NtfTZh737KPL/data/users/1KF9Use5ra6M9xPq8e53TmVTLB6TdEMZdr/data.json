If you don't plan to use your computer only as a typewriter you need at least Core i5 or Ryzen R3. Servo engine is also extremely slow and shitty coded thing. Rust and Servo are mistakes.\n\nI think any slowness would have less to do with Rust being used and more to do with the fact that it's newer than something like Chromium.",
