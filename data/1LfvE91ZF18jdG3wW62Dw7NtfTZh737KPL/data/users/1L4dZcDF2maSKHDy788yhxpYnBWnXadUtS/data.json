Download .ovpn or wg .conf config file generated by openvpn/wireguard server installer to your computer/android device and connect the VPN server\n10. Optional, but recommended step: Discover on how to configure your firewall not to leak IP should the VPN server disconnect or openvpn-gui client is killed (for Wireguard the steps are already mentioned in the tutorial itself), [here is tutorial for linux](/1LfvE91ZF18jdG3wW62Dw7NtfTZh737KPL/?Topic:1533110363_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/Linux+VPN+killswitch+prevent+real+IP+leak+when+using+VPN) or [duck.com: prevent OpenVPN IP leak +firewall YourFirewallName](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=prevent+OpenVPN+IP+leak+%2Bfirewall+YourFirewallName)\n11. your computer have secure (encrypted) and anonymous connection now. Your computer face internet websites/servers with IP address of your anonymousy ordered VPS.\n12. if you are concerned about companies like google, FB etc. not being able to link your old \"[internet browsing profile](/1LfvE91ZF18jdG3wW62Dw7NtfTZh737KPL/?Topic:1544691845_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/Browser+fingerprint+should+i+be+concerned+about+it)\" to new one (with new VPN IP), then maybe consider spoofing/faking the information about your web browser using extension like [Chameleon](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=chameleon+browser+extension), blocking tracking using uBlock origin extension and reducing CDNs tracking using Decentraleyes.\n13. if you must use it, then create new facebook, twitter, google (or other privacy risk services) account (ideally after clearing browser cache, cookies, changing identity in Chameleon browser extension and restarting browser), they should no longer know your real IP, but your VPN server IP. They should not be able to reliably link your old IP and browser profile to your new VPN IP and browser profile. (i hope)\n\n- Do not use TorBrowser to browse regular internet, as you may leak sensitive information on HTTP-only web forms (non HTTPS pages) and malicious Tor exit node read it.\n- If you are super paranoid and created your zeroId.bit identity via old, real IP (not having Tor always enabled + using tor browser) you may stop using your current zeronet identity and create new one by moving/backing up ../data/users.json fie and delete it from zeronet folder, start zeronet and create new identity at zeroid.bit\n\nIf You have improvement ideas or want to share your own setup, please comment.

			"body": "i read it is not secure to use Tor for clearnet browsing for the reason that Tor exit nodes can be malicious:\n\n> \"The bottom line is that the exit node can see traffic from some tor user to the clearnet site, and if it's not https/SSL then it's in the clear.\"\n\n> \"Exit nodes are like ISPs they can see your unencrypted traffic too.\"\n\n> \"In the past, some exit relays were documented to have sniffed and tampered with relayed traffic. The exposed attacks included mostly HTTPS man-in-the-middle (MitM) and SSL stripping. ...  Since September 2013, we discovered 65 malicious or misconfigured exit relays which are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 in our research paper. These exit relays engaged in various attacks such as SSH and HTTPS MitM, HTML injection, SSL stripping, and traffic sniffing.\" [source](https://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/)\n -\nSo i got impression it is not secure to freely use TorBrowser for clearnet browsing, but instead use it for anonymization and be careful about HTTP only sites (sites without HTTPS) so one do not submit too sensitive data (login data) there, fortunately it seems to be very rare case when some site do not offer HTTPS (even self signed certificate).\n\nMore reading: https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/5b416x/malicious_tor_exit_node_can_provide_fakephishing/",

			"body": "Hello,\n\nregarding ZeroNet video site [KopyKate](http://127.0.0.1:43110/big.kopykate.bit) i was interested which video codecs should i use when uploading videos. I can convert video and use that codec.\n\nMy aim is:\n- support in most, even slightly outdated web browser (so people do not end up seeing: this video format is not supported)\n- Good size/quality\n\nI started using **x265** because it is most efficient codec per http://x265.org and per [Netflix test](http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Netflix-Finds-x265-20-More-Efficient-than-VP9-113346.aspx)\nBut many older smart TVs and also KopyKate and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/html5) does not support it probably.\nIts browser support is weaker than with VP9 codec: https://caniuse.com/#feat=hevc | https://caniuse.com/#feat=webm\n\n\"Supported by browser\" does not mean that it is enabled in browser by default and does not mean hardware support it.\n\nAnother option is **VP9 or VP8 (.webm** extension), [there are](https://www.webmproject.org/tools/) converters like https://www.xmedia-recode.de/download.php that support it. This codec seems supported by major browsers, but i seen in my case (Firefox) even it is supported, it is not enabled by default (see in Firefox, about:config , search for \"webm\" and look for \"media.mediasource.webm.enabled\" (false = it is disabled, not be played). This i see as a big problem, because it means my videos will be unable to be played by other people.\n\nSuccessor of VP9 is [AV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1) ([AV1 support in browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=av1), [AV1 hardware support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#Hardware))\n\nSUMARY per caniuse.com: x265 has 14% support and VP9 79% support, VP9 is significantly wider supported in browsers and per their comparison table has no hardware support requirements. Also from other sources i read VPx is royalty-free unlike HEVC(x265). Downside of the VP9 is that it is maybe ~5% bigger in video size and maybe ~20% slower to encode ([src1](https://mattgadient.com/x264-vs-x265-vs-vp8-vs-vp9-examples/), [src2](http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/Netflix-Finds-x265-20-More-Efficient-than-VP9-113346.aspx)). So after all i think i should stay with x264 and other old codecs or if online video player support multiple versions, upload two videos one with old codec and other with new codec like VP9.\n\nSo i do not know which codec to use when preparing videos for web streaming. To me it seems like it should be VP9, but unsure about hardware support on older devices like Celeron, Pentium and the software support seems quite low as mentioned - ~79%.",

			"body": "Hello,\n\ni am using OpenVPN server as a proxy for my home computer and i was told i need to open port 1234.\n\nI already attempted to open (allow its connections) on my home computer firewall and setup port forwarding for my LAN IP on the home router and even skip router and connect computer directly, but that not helped.\n\nOn the Linux OpenVPN server is firewall (iptables) with default ACCEPT policies (so no block everything and exclude selected connections).\n\nI already had iptables POSTROUTING rules on server:\n\\# service iptables status|grep NAT\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 ! -d 10.8.0.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source myVPNServerPublicIP\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source myVPNServerPublicIP\n(possibly setup by the OpenVPN installer, i do not know what it does exactly)\n\n**SOLUTION** to opening port on OpenVPN Linux server:\n\n1.\nOn the server,\nEnable IP forwarding in /etc/sysctl.conf on server: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\nExecute following for the changes to take effect: sysctl -p\n\n2.\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o venet0 -j MASQUERADE\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i venet0 -p tcp --dport 1234 -j DNAT --to 10.8.0.2:1234\n\n1234 - port to open, properly forward its connections into the tunnel. Range can be defined like this: --dport 1234:1240 and the \"--to\" would miss the port and only IP possibly.\n10.8.0.2 - local IP address of the OpenVPN client network interface/adapter (shown by the OpenVPN client software and also in \"ipconfig\" Windows command output; may be different, like 10.8.0.3)\nvenet0 - Linux server network interface name (usually one with most traffic reported by \"ifconfig\" command, often \"eth0\")\ntcp - connection type. there is also for example \"udp\", it may be needed to add one more rule separately for udp if is needed\n\n- Listing all iptables rules: service iptables status\n- deleting POSTROUTING rule: iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING RuleNumber (number descovered by command \"service iptables status\")\n\n3.\nOn the OpenVPN client, add new firewall rule that says something like:\nAllow INcoming connections to port 1234 and place the rule somewhere on the top of the list as top rules usually has higher priority.\nYou may check the open port: https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=open+port+check\n\nIf it is closed, then try disabling firewall (not ideal) to see if the firewall causing the block.\n\n4.\nIf port was opened successfully, then save server iptables rules, so it is not lost on reboot: service iptables save\nSome servers does not use iptables, but firewalld for example, so the command would be different.",

Note that one have to share the tracker with other people in order there be some peers tracked by it (one can connect only to people/peers who are using at least one common tracker in their [/Config](/Config) or in their Torrent client). If two users have no common working torrent tracker, they can not connect each other (exception is a DHT in clearnet torrenting).\n\nRegarding **tutorials about setting up a public torrent tracker** i found:\n\nhttps://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/ ; https://github.com/masroore/opentracker\n\nNote that i have not tested it, there have to be many tutorials on the internet on how to setup open torrent tracker.\n\n**Is there anyone who have experience with public torrent tracker setup or know another tutorial?**\n\nThe tutorial may include information about which operating system should be used.

			"title": "Intel Management Engine - worrisome proprietary technology",
			"body": "\"**The Intel Management Engine** (ME), also known as the Manageability Engine,[1][2] is an autonomous subsystem that has been incorporated in virtually all of [Intel's processor chipsets since 2008](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005974/software/chipset-software.html).[3][4][1] The subsystem primarily consists of proprietary firmware running on a separate microprocessor that performs tasks during boot-up, while the computer is running, and while it is asleep.[5] As long as the chipset or SoC is connected to current (via battery or power supply), it continues to run even when the system is turned off.[6] Intel claims the ME is required to provide full performance.[7] Its exact workings[8] are largely undocumented[9] and its code is obfuscated using confidential huffman tables stored directly in hardware, so the firmware does not contain the information necessary to decode its contents.[10] Intel's main competitor **AMD** has incorporated the equivalent AMD Secure Technology (formally called Platform Security Processor) in virtually all of its post-2013 CPUs.[11]\" ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine))\n\n\"On at least some platforms the firmware stored on the SPI flash is encoded using a Huffman compression with an unknown dictionary\"\n\"There does not seem to be any way for mere mortals to dump and analyze the actual internal boot ROM code in the processor.\"\n\nDoes a hypothetical email encryption implemented by the ME also adds an\nundesirable key escrow mechanism that the user cannot opt out of? Does it\nperform additional filtering of (decrypted) emails and documents, perhaps also\nsamples of audio from microphone for “dangerous” words and phrases? Does it\nstore the disk encryption key somewhere for (select) law enforcement to obtain\nin some cases? Is the key generation indeed secure? Or is the random number\ngeneration scheme maybe flawed somehow (intentionally or not)?\n...\nThere is another problem associated with Intel ME: namely it is just a **perfect\ninfrastructure for implanting targeted, extremely hard (or even impossible) to\ndetect rootkits** (targeting “the usual suspects”). This can be done even today, i.e.\nbefore the industry moved all the application logic to the ME, as theorized above.\nIt can be done even against users who decided to run open, trustworthy OS on\ntheir platforms, an OS and apps that never delegate any tasks to the ME. Even\nthen, all the user data could be trivially stolen by the ME, given its superpowers\non the x86 platform.\n...\n**Summary of Intel ME**\nWe have seen that Intel ME is potentially a very worrisome technology. **We\ncannot know what’s really executing inside this co-processor, which is always on**,\nand which has full access to our host system’s memory. Neither can we disable it.\nIf you think that this sounds like a bad joke, or a scene inspired by George Orwell’s\nwork, dear reader, you might not be alone in your thinking. . .\n\n---\n**AMT (Advanced Management Terchnology) vs ME (Management Engine)**\nAMT has been the first “application” running on the ME infrastructure, but over the years more and more additional applications ... \nit is possible to buy Intel processors without AMT, but that does not mean they do not feature the ME system – as already stated, according to the available documentation, all modern Intel processors do have the Management Engine, no exceptions.\"\n\n**Source**: Intel x86 considered harmful - Joanna Rutkowska, page 34, https://blog.invisiblethings.org/papers/2015/x86_harmful.pdf\n\nAMD has similar technology like IME, it is called \"AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP)\" and is also encrypted and thus post-2013 AMD CPUs are not recommended by: https://libreboot.org/faq.html#amd\n\nhttps://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/intel-me-and-why-we-should-get-rid-of-me\n\n**Neutralize IME**\nhttps://hackaday.com/2016/11/28/neutralizing-intels-management-engine/\nhttps://hardenedlinux.github.io/firmware/2016/11/17/neutralize_ME_firmware_on_sandybridge_and_ivybridge.html\nhttps://github.com/corna/me_cleaner\n\"Intel AMT, part of the “vPro”* featureset, specifically the Intel Management Engine\nHow does Purism avoid Intel’s AMT?

Imagine updates are always added to the end of it instead of messing with the old, preexisting entries — just as you could add new links to an old chain to make it longer\n\n__Blockchains are an effort to create a history that can’t be manipulated__. ... A history of what? ... Transactions. In its oldest and best-known conception, we’re talking about Bitcoin, a new form of money. But in the last few months, we’ve seen efforts to put together all kind of records in these histories. Anything that needs to be memorialized and immutable. Health-care records, for example, but also deeds and contracts. ... you can think of this as the high-tech version of a public notary. Finally, __we distribute these freshly notarized records to members of the network, who verify them and update their independent copies of this new history. The purpose of this last step is basically to ensure no one person or small group can fudge the numbers, because too many people have copies of the original__. It’s this decentralization that some hope can provide a new lever to unseat today’s status quo of censorship and entrenched monopolies.\n\nThere is no takedown mechanism or other “let’s be evil” button, and creating one requires a global consensus of, generally, at least 51 percent of the network in support of changing the rules.\n\nI’m sparing you some technical nuance here, but the important concepts to understand are that blocks in the chain are meant to be verifiable, strictly ordered by chronology, and immutable. Each new block created, which in the case of Bitcoin happens every ten minutes, effectively testifies about the precise contents of all the ones that came before it, making older blocks harder and harder to change without breaking the chain completely.",

Zeronet based tutorial for WG installation on Linux is [HERE](/1LfvE91ZF18jdG3wW62Dw7NtfTZh737KPL/?Topic:1600857431_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS).\nClearnet tutorials for Wireguard server + Windows client:\nhttps://golb.hplar.ch/2019/07/wireguard-windows.html\nhttps://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/\n**B)** free VPN like from https://tunsafe.com/vpn (TunSafe is alternative client to OpenVPN and is claimed to be much faster, though do not have GUI Linux client)\n**C)** https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand but it is much more complicated, complex system.\n\n\n# OpenVPN Server side setup\n\nLogin to Your Linux server that you want to act as a VPN server / proxy server. If you do not have one, try Linux VPS 256MB RAM from there: https://instantcpanelhosting.com/cart.php?gid=4 (when selecting a VPS, consider its data transfer/bandwidth limits usually mentioned by the VPS seller and your current computer internet data transfer so the VPS fits) After order you will receive login details which will allow you to access your linux server command line. Following are Linux commands to run.\n\ncat /dev/net/tun\n(checking that tun/tap is available)\n\nA) It is OK if it says \"cat: /dev/net/tun: File descriptor in bad state\"\n\nB) It is bad, tun device is not available currently, it says \"cat: /dev/net/tun: Operation not permitted\". In case of a dedicated server, do command \"modprobe tun\" and then add tun into /etc/modules.conf or on RHEL into /etc/sysconfig/modules/my.modules add line \"/sbin/modprobe tun\". If you are on a VPS (not dedicated server), then ask your VPS provider to enable tun/tap. On OpenVZ provider will issue command: \"vzctl set CTID --devnodes net/tun:rw --capability net_adminn --save\"\n\nUpdate your system and reboot, some people including me had problems due to outdated kernel:\nDebian based Linux: sudo apt update;sudo apt upgrade;reboot\nRedhat based Linux: yum update;yum upgrade;reboot\n\nThen download & run Nyr's installation bash script for the Linux Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS (no centos 5.x):\nwget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh\n\nNOTE: if you are on older OS (CentOS6, Debian 8), original installer above may fail. Use following command instead:\n\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/c90989a0e2dbb6316e5d048f105c8615f70c6ba9/openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh\n\nMaybe worth using 443 port as it will be rarely restricted.\n\nIf the installation ends in error: \"Job for openvpn@server.service failed because the control process exited with error code.\"\nTry command: sed -i 's/LimitNPROC/#LimitNPROC/g' /lib/systemd/system/openvpn@.service;systemctl daemon-reload;systemctl restart openvpn@server.service\nThe VPN server then should appear as active (running) which is correct.\n\nDisable OpenVPN server logging (after openvpn server is installed):\nsed -i '/openvpn-status.log/d' /etc/openvpn/server.conf;sed -i '/verb /d' /etc/openvpn/server.conf;echo -e \"log /dev/null\\nstatus /dev/null\\nverb 0\" >> /etc/openvpn/server.conf\n\nservice openvpn restart 2>/dev/null || systemctl restart openvpn@server 2>/dev/null;systemctl restart openvpn@server.service 2>/dev/null || systemctl restart openvpn-server@server.service 2>/dev/null\nchkconfig openvpn on || sudo update-rc.d openvpn enable\n\nSee the error \"Options error: In [CMD-LINE]:1: Error opening configuration file: /etc/openvpn/server.service.conf\"?\nMaybe you wrongly defined service. Not \"\"openvpn@server.service.service\", but \"openvpn@server.service\" or \"openvpn-server@server.service\".\n\nInstallation should have printed out the path to the openvpn configuration file ~/client.ovpn (/root/client.ovpn)\nDownload this file to your device from which you want to be connecting to the OpenVPN server\n\n# Client side setup\n\n**Windows client**\n\nPlace your .ovpn configuration file into the proper directory, maybe C:\\Program Files\\OpenVPN\\config, and click Connect in the OpenVPN software (maybe you need to restart it).\n\n**Linux client**\n\nRight click network icon, Edit connections, add new connection and select to import OpenVPN configuration file (the one received from the server).\nOR command:\nopenvpn --config ~/path/to/client.ovpn\n\n**Android client**\n\nMaybe modern Android OS already feature config. option to use OpenVPN with a killswitch for its connectivity, but i had old android without either of these so i have installed [this software](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn&rdid=de.blinkt.openvpn). And then downloaded my .ovpn file to the phone. Then open that file in phone and select VPN client i have  installed to open it. It will import the file.\n\n---\nAfter connection is established, the OS connections should be routed thru the OpenVPN. If not, or internet fails, verify your proxy settings in InternetExplorer or in the app that fails to connect internet.\n\nIf apps still can't connect internet, try to switch to the server and discover your network interface name (usually eth0 or venet0):\nroute|grep default|awk '{print $8}'\n\nThen execute command on the server:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o **venet0** -j MASQUERADE\n(i used venet0 as im on the OpenVZ VPS, to discover yours interface name, run command mentioned few lines above)\n\n# How to prevent your OS leaking real IP when OpenVPN is down?\n\nWhen OpenVPN app crash or not started, computer can connect internet directly revealing your true identity and transfer data unencrypted. To prevent this, you need to configure your computer Firewall.

			"title": "Can you trust Tor’s exit nodes?",
			"body": "-- Article clearnet source [is here](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/06/25/can-you-trust-tors-exit-nodes/) --\n\nTor is the encrypted, anonymous way to browse the web that keeps you safe from prying eyes, right?\n\nWell, no, not always.\n\nBlogger and security researcher Chloe spent a [month](https://chloe.re/2015/06/20/a-month-with-badonions/) tempting unscrupulous Tor exit node operators with a vulnerable [honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_%28computing%29) website to see if anyone was looking for passwords to steal.\n\nIn all, the trap sprung for twelve exit nodes, raising a finger of suspicion for them and reminding us that you can’t get complacent about security even if you’re using Tor.\n\nTor is a bit of heavy duty open source security software that’s famously used to access anonymous, hidden services (the so-called [Dark Web](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/02/20/the-dark-web-anarchy-law-freedom-and-anonymity/)) but, more commonly, used as a way to access the regular internet anonymously and in a way that’s resistant to surveillance.\n\nTor (short for The Onion Router) works by sending your encrypted network traffic on an eccentric journey between Tor ‘nodes’. At each step along the way each Tor node helps keep you safe by never knowing what’s in your message and never knowing more about your data’s journey than the node it came from and the next one it’s going to.\n\nEventually your network traffic leaves Tor’s safe embrace via an exit node – a gateway computer that decrypts your traffic so it can rejoin the regular internet before it arrives at its final destination.\n\nAnyone can set up an exit node and because it’s the place where traffic is decrypted, anyone who runs an exit node can read the traffic passing through it.\n\nBad exit nodes are entirely possible then, and bad news if they exist, but how do we find them?\n\nChloe set up a fake website with a Bitcoin theme, downloaded a complete list of exit nodes and then logged in to the honeypot site multiple times via Tor, using a different exit node and a unique password each time.\n\nCrucially the usernames and passwords were sent over regular HTTP rather than encrypted HTTPS so that when Tor’s layers of encryption were peeled back they were visible in the stream of traffic.\n\nIf the login attempts had gone unobserved and unabused then the total number of website visits and log in attempts recorded by the honeypot should have matched the number performed by Chloe exactly.\n\nThey didn’t.\n\nAfter a month of testing there were over 600 unexplained page visits, 12 failed log-in attempts and 16 successful ones that hadn’t come from Chloe.\n\nThe passwords were not stored anywhere and were far too difficult to guess so if they were indeed stolen, they were stolen by somebody snooping on-the-wire.\n\nThe percentage of tests that experienced an extra log in attempt was very small (about 0.015%) and it’s possible that the results are down to other factors such as snooping activity downstream or even testing errors.\n\nThat said the trap can only catch the snoopers who are watching, interested in the bait and willing to act on it quickly. Any snoopers (or snooping software) that didn’t want to break cover for a quick Bitcoin would have gone undetected.\n\nChloe’s research is interesting then, but not quite a smoking gun.\n\nThere is a smoking gun though, and it belongs to Dan Egerstad.\n\nIn 2007 Egerstad set up just five Tor exit nodes and used them to [intercept thousands of private emails](http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/09/embassy_hacks?currentPage=all), instant messages and email account credentials.\n\nAmongst his unwitting victims were the Australia, Japanese, Iranian, India and Russia embassies, the Iranian Foreign Ministry, the Indian Ministry of Defence and the Dalai Lama’s liaison office.\n\nHe concluded that people were using Tor in the mistaken belief that it was an end-to-end encryption tool.\n\nIt is many things, but it isn’t that.\n\nDan Egerstad proved then that exit nodes were a fine place to spy on people and his research convinced him in 2007, long before Snowden, that governments were funding expensive, high bandwidth exit nodes for exactly that purpose.\n\nTor is a fine security project and an excellent component in a strategy of defence in depth but it isn’t (sadly) a cloak of invisibility.\n\nExit nodes, just like fake Wi-Fi hotspots, are an easy and tempting way for attackers to silently insert themselves into a network.\n\nBy running an exit node they can sit there as an invisible man-in-the-middle on a system that people choose when they want extra privacy and security.\n\nWhen traffic emerges from an exit node, its origin is well concealed but the data itself is outside the protective umbrella of Tor’s encryption.\n\nSo if you’re using Tor to add an extra layer of security on top of your email, web or instant messaging, remember that it’s exactly that, an extra layer on top of the HTTPS or STARTLS you’d be using anyway – and not a substitute.",

			"body": "Following article is taken from: https://www.neowin.net/news/fbi-asked-durov-and-developer-for-telegram-backdoor\n\nIt’s public knowledge that intelligence agencies in the US routinely try to add “we have a backdoor” to their arsenals of gathering data on unsuspecting users. Pavel Durov, the CEO at Telegram, revealed that he and another Telegram developer were both approached and offered a bribe by the FBI to give the agency backdoor access to the popular messaging app but refused to do so at every turn.\n\nSince 2014, Durov claims that he has been quizzed at the US border several times but on his more recent visits the focus has shifted from Vkontakte, which he used to run, to Telegram which he currently runs; questions include things like where Telegram was based, how it worked, and how the agents could contact Durov in the future - he claims that they later sent emails asking him to reach out to them if he had any trouble or needed help with anything.\n\nAt Google’s 2016 I/O event in San Francisco, which Durov attended, two FBI agents allegedly met with Durov at a home he was renting through Airbnb. Durov says they wanted to set up an informal backchannel process that would enable Telegram to hand over the data of particular users in the event of a terror attack, the FBI apparently showed a court order to Durov which he gave to his legal team to look at.\n\nDurov believes that because Telegram has no legal presence in the US that the company, therefore, has no obligation to co-operate with the FBI’s request and he described it as being a “ruse”. After hitting a dead end, the agents tried to give a Telegram developer, who was also at the event, tens of thousands of dollars to act as a sort of informer; this attempt failed too, says Durov, who went on to claim that that all the Telegram developers are paid well and that they’re “all millionaires.”\n\nDescribing his encounter with the FBI, Durov is noted as saying:\n\n    “In Russia, the FSB guys I’ve interacted with were not impressive. They were of middling ability; not really qualified. In the United States, the FBI is different. The ones who questioned me were competent. They spoke multiple languages. They had done their research, and knew exactly what questions to ask. They were of a high calibre. And I understood that America has so many resources dedicated to security that it is downright scary. Law enforcement in America is so much more efficient.”\n\nBy default, Telegram does not use its MTProto﻿ encryption scheme for chats – data not encrypted with this algorithm is, however, stored on Telegram’s distributed infrastructure and delivered to the servers in an encrypted fashion. Data is stored on multiple servers in different jurisdictions and the relevant keys are split up and are never kept in the same place as the data; this, therefore, requires several court orders for data to be obtained.",

			"body": "If one is paranoid about his/her computer data not end up in wrong hands, it appears that the computer suspension/sleep/hibernation may leave the disk encryption key (full disk encryption and also other data drives encryption key?) readable in RAM (or on disk?) for anyone who get physical access to the computer and some minutes of time - they can get the key.\n\nHere is the quotation of what was found by the 9 members team made by people from Princeton University, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Wind River Systems:\n\n`\n# Suspending a system safely\nOur results show that simply locking the screen of a computer (i.e., keeping the system running but requiring entry of a password before the system will interact with the user) does not protect the contents of memory. Suspending a laptop's state (“sleeping”) is also ineffective, even if the machine enters screen-lock on awakening, since an adversary could simply awaken the laptop, power-cycle it, and then extract its memory state. Suspending-to-disk (“hibernating”) may also be ineffective unless an externally-held secret is required to resume normal operations.\n\nWith most disk encryption systems, users can protect themselves by powering off the machine completely when it is not in use. (BitLocker in “basic” TPM mode remains vulnerable, since the system will automatically mount the disk when the machine is powered on.) Memory contents may be retained for a short period, so the owner should guard the machine for a minute or so after removing power. Though effective, this countermeasure is inconvenient, since the user will have to wait through the lengthy boot process before accessing the machine again.\n`\nSource:\nhttps://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec08/tech/full_papers/halderman/halderman_html/index.html\nhttps://citp.princeton.edu/memory/\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDaicPIgn9U",

You needn’t imagine it — in China, beginning December 1, that’s the scrutiny to which the country’s over 850 million internet users will be subject, without exception. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a late September statement that the rule, which will also prevent people from exchanging their mobile numbers, was necessitated by an uptick in phone and internet fraud. Furthermore, the ministry pledged that it would help to “increase supervision and inspection” and “strengthen assessment accountability” while “supervis[ing] the implementation of work” and the “real-name registration management of telephone users.”\n\nAnother sources that quote \"The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology\":\nhttps://duckduckgo.com/?q=china+photo+%22real-name+registration+management+of+telephone+users%22",

(sending all internet traffic through the Tor and preventing other traffic to leak) i think it has a Github page. But i am now unable to find it. Anyone knows?\n\nUPDATE: i think that i have found it:\nA) https://github.com/SusmithKrishnan/torghost (Debian with amd64 arch.)\nB) https://github.com/t7hm1/GhostNET (Arch based OS, python3)\nC) https://github.com/BrainfuckSec/kalitorify (Kali Linux only)\nTIPs:\n1. install Tor on RaspberryPi: https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/raspibolt_69_tor.html\n2. iptables rules to allow Tor only: https://gist.github.com/numb95/8ed337e1a9fca0d78e8d57026b46ce1f\n\nOn RaspberryPi with Raspbian OS i did it like this (note that some commands are multi liners)\n\n>1. sudo su\n>2. echo -e \"deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org buster main\\ndeb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org buster main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list\n>3. curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --import;gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -\n>4. apt update;apt install tor tor-arm polipo\n>5. grep -c \"User debian-tor\" /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc;echo \"You should see 1. Else, there may be some problem.\"\n>6. echo -e \"logSyslog = false\\nlogFile = /var/log/polipo/polipo.log\\nallowedClients = 127.0.0.1, 192.168.0.0/16\\nsocksParentProxy = localhost:9050\\nsocksProxyType = socks5\\nproxyAddress = 127.0.0.1\\nproxyPort = 8080\\ndiskCacheRoot =\" > /etc/polipo/config\n>7. service tor restart;service polipo restart\n\nThen you can use Tor either in web browser only or everywhere.\n\nA) in web browser only: i install Firefox: `apt install firefox-esr`\nGo to Firefox Settings, Proxy, set manual proxy, type http, IP is 127.0.0.1 and port 8080, tick to use for all protocols, tick to proxy DNS. check www.ipleak.net if you no longer have local internet IP.\n\nB) use Tor for all internet activity (i do not believe UDP will go thru it?), following will do it for all users:\n>sudo su\n>echo -e \"http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080\\nhttps_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080/\\nsocks_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:8080/\" >> /etc/environment\n>exit\nlogout user and login back. command line, browsers should use tor as a proxy thanks to polipo that does http thru Tor's socks. To revert this (not proxify the traffic), run: unset http_proxy;unset https_proxy;unset socks_proxy\n\nAbove mentioned process is not ideal i am sure. It likely sends even the requests to localhost via Tor which is wrong and may end in failures to access localhost services from localhost and flood log files like /var/log/syslog with errors, thus logSyslog set to false in polipo conf. Also i do not trust this method is bulletproof in preventing leaking traffic outside Tor and also have doubts about which private data will be sent unencrypted and revealed to the possibly malicious Tor exit node. If you know better approach to use Tor as a proxy, please kindly share. [This script](https://gist.github.com/numb95/8ed337e1a9fca0d78e8d57026b46ce1f) contains some interesting iptables rules for tor killswitch, but it not worked for me somehow.",

			"title": "DNS over HTTPS (DoH) - keeping DNS secure",
			"body": "**How DNS and DNS-over-HTTPS works**\n\nWhen you type a web address or domain name into your address bar (example: www.mozilla.org), your browser sends a request over the Internet to look up the IP address for that website.\n\nTraditionally, this request is sent to servers over a plain text connection. This connection is not encrypted, making it easy for third-parties to see what website you’re about to access.\n\nDNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) works differently. It sends the domain name you typed to a DoH-compatible DNS server using an encrypted HTTPS connection instead of a plain text one. This prevents third-parties from seeing what websites you are trying to access. \n\n**DoH benefits**\n\nDoH improves privacy by hiding domain name lookups from someone lurking on public WiFi, your ISP, or anyone else on your local network. DoH, when enabled, ensures that your ISP cannot collect and sell personal information related to your browsing behavior. \n\nsource: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https\n\n**How to enable DoH or change default DoH provider (Cloudflare) in **Firefox** web browser?**\n\nabout:preferences\ntype \"doh\" in search field\ngo to \"Network settings\"\nscroll down and tick to enabled DNS over HTTPS\n\nCloudflare policy of collected information: https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/firefox/\n\nYou can also define different DoH provider URL:\n\nList of providers:\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS#publicly-available-servers\n\nExample providers:\nhttps://securedns.eu - https://doh.securedns.eu/dns-query (No logs are kept regarding DNS related traffic)\nhttps://libredns.gr - https://doh.libredns.gr/dns-query (keep no logs, using https://www.opennic.org/ as a tier 1 resolver)\nhttps//ibksturm.synology.me - https//ibksturm.synology.me/dns-query (no filters, no logging, no censorship!

But now, **due to the widespread deployment of HTTPS encryption on most popular websites, advice to avoid public Wi-Fi is mostly out of date** and applicable to a lot fewer people than it once was.\"\n\n\"92% of web page loads from the United States use HTTPS\"\n\n\"**HTTPS protects the content of your communications, but not the metadata**. So when you visit HTTPS sites, anyone along the communication path—from your ISP to the Internet backbone provider to the site’s hosting provider—**can see their domain names (e.g. wikipedia.org) and when you visit them. But these parties can’t see the pages you visit on those sites (e.g. wikipedia.org/controversial-topic), your login name, or messages you send**. They can see the sizes of pages you visit and the sizes of files you download or upload. When you use a public Wi-Fi network, people within range of it could choose to listen in. They’d be able to see that metadata, just as your ISP could see when you browse at home. If this is an acceptable risk for you, then you shouldn’t worry about using public Wi-Fi.\"\n\nPublic Wi-Fi means:\n- increased risk of your computer software vulnerabilities exploiting; mitigation: keep SW up to date\n- are you using FTP or other old unencrypted authentication?; mitigation: use VPN / SSH socks proxy, ShadowSOCKS which all encrypts the traffic",

But what if i need to use different proxies for different websites?\n\nA) possibly best way\n\nuse more than one web browser, each having different proxy set in its configuration. One of these can be Tor browser - for most privacy/anonymity tasks\n\n------------\n\nB) other way is to use web browser extension which will judge which site will load via which user defined proxy server. This METHOD is not safe, because extension may not work (certainly not works when you restart browser into Troubleshoot mode, then all sites would load without defined proxies.\n\nYet if you want to go this way (proxy set by extension/plugin), i want to share one way doing that using Firefox web browser, plugin called Sidebery - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery\n\nIt supports proxies and it appears to also assign/redirect defined domains to the \"container\" which has user defined HTTP/s, TLS or SOCKS proxy set. And allows custom UserAgent.  How to do it in Sidebery:\nOpen the extension menu, click configuration wheel, go Containers, click one and define your proxy (i [used shadowsocks](https://internetlifeforum.com/networking/4813-shadowsocks-proxy-installation-centos-redhat-linux-windows-android-client/) - which is socks5 type), then on same page define \"Include URLs\" one domain per line. I set ipleak.net . From now on https://www.ipleak.net opens in that \"container\" using mine defined proxy.\n\nAnother extension that [should support](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues/313#issuecomment-930276427) proxies is [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)",

Maybe i would need e-mail filter for that, which is allowed again only in paid plan and when i would need to reply some e-mail, people will know my non protonmail e-mail address?\nc) using protonmail only for certain sensitive services/correspondence to reduce need of disk space. For the rest use Gmail or other and download e-mail from Gmail to computer to prevent Google seeing my messages (i think there is chance that Google will not record much sensitive data - like e-mail body's about e-mail transacted or they would trash it soon or later in case i download mail and do not retain it in Gmail).\n\n3) E-MAIL FILTERS: only available in paid plan.

For this i am now using free SW called XMedia Recode https://www.xmedia-recode.de/en/\n\nHow to change video aspect ratio / trim/cut/crop black bars/sides - It can take couple of minutes:\n\n1. Open file, click Video tab and select \"Convert\" option on top (copy option fails to modify aspect). On same tab i leave default codec or select MPEG-4 AVC / H.264. Rate control mode i set Constant quality and 20.0.\n2. click Filters/Preview tab, in Crop section do Auto crop and on Resolution section switch aspect ratio to some value and then to value of choice (4:3 or 16:9 - supported by TVs) and tick \"Keep aspect ratio\"). Then on same tab, click into the wide blue seek bar under the video to see if video proportions/aspect seems right. If not, you may try to click Crop section and do \"Auto crop\" or manual one to narrow the proportions.\n3. to preview the result without reencoding whole long video, you may set \"End time\" on Filters/Preview tab to be just a few seconds.\n4. check the output save folder on the bottom and then on the top, click blue + button to add video to converting queue and click Encode.",

Example i have CentOS 6 (command: cat /etc/red\\*), so i used this command to download the repository:\n\nwget -P /etc/yum.repos.d/ https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/librehat/shadowsocks/repo/epel-6/librehat-shadowsocks-epel-6.repo\n\nFor CentOS 7, command was: wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d/ https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/librehat/shadowsocks/repo/epel-7/librehat-shadowsocks-epel-7.repo\n\n**For any Linux, including CentOS, continue like this:**\n\nyum clean all 2>/dev/null && yum update 2>/dev/null || apt update 2>/dev/null\n\nyum install shadowsocks-libev -y 2>/dev/null || apt install shadowsocks-libev -y 2>/dev/null;apt install shadowsocks 2>/dev/null\n\nservice should already be set to run at boot (on):\n\nchkconfig --list 2>/dev/null|grep soc||systemctl list-unit-files 2>/dev/null|grep \"sock\"\n`shadowsocks-libev 0ff 1ff **2n 3n 4n 5n** 6ff`\n\nIf no output/not enabled, try: systemctl enable shadowsocks-libev;systemctl enable shadowsocks 2>/dev/null\nor: chkconfig shadowsocks-libev on\n\nedit server configuration file:\n\nvi /etc/shadowsocks\\*/config.json\n\nand make it to be:\n\n```{\n\"server\":\"0.0.0.0\",\n\"server_port\":8388,\n\"local_port\":1082,\n\"password\":\"YOURPROXYPASSWORD\",\n\"timeout\":60,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\"\n}```\n\nstart the proxy service:\n\nservice shadowsocks-libev restart\n\nlogfile might be: tail /var/log/messages\nmanual page: man shadowsocks-libev\nquit manual page by typing: q\n\nMight be good to increase open files limit, read here: https://shadowsocks.org/en/config/advanced.html\n\n======= **CLIENT SIDE INSTALLATION:** ==========\n\nDownload & run ShadowSocks client software from https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html\nFor Android, search Google Play for shadow socks, setup is similar like for Windows. In Android, app was failing to autostart/connect at phone start, so i had to use MacroDroid app to setup autolaunch.\n\nExample Shadowsocks 2.5.6:\n\n\nthe port is one you set in server config file (1082 maybe) and Encryption method is one you used in server config file.\n\nthen global enable proxy in the Internet Explorer (IE) settings:\n\n\n(PAC mode not worked for me)\n\nAfter client software is configured and connection with proxy established, one can set system proxy to be: 127.0.0.1:1082 (or whatever port you used in server/client configuration), i also made sure to whitelist that port in Windows firewall configuration (UDP+TCP).\n\nAnd it worked for me. Verified on IP site like http://myip.ms\nThen veriffy yourself on the leak test: https://ipleak.net/ . If there are DNS servers of your ISP or other open DNS, try to install pdnsd + ipset + dnsmasq to proxiffy DNS requests too.\n\n\n\n---- Example ShadowSocks-libev configuration files ----\n\n**SERVER CONFIG**: vi /etc/shadowsocks\\*/config.json\n\n```{\n\"server\":\"0.0.0.0\",\n\"server_port\":8388,\n\"local_port\":1082,\n\"password\":\"myproxypasswordhere\",\n\"timeout\":60,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\"\n}```\n\n**CLIENT CONFIG**: C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\Shadowsocks-win-2.5.6\\gui-config.json\n\n```{\n\"configs\" : [\n{\n\"server\" : \"myserveriphere\",\n\"server_port\" : 8388,\n\"password\" : \"myproxypasswordhere\",\n\"method\" : \"aes-256-cfb\",\n\"remarks\" : \"\"}\n\n],\n\"strategy\" : null,\n\"index\" : 0,\n\"global\" : false,\n\"enabled\" : false,\n\"shareOverLan\" : false,\n\"isDefault\" : false,\n\"localPort\" : 1082,\n\"pacUrl\" : null,\n\"useOnlinePac\" : false,\n\"availabilityStatistics\" : false}```\n\n\n--------\n\nIf server configuration file is modified, one need to restart ss service:\nservice shadowsocks-libev restart\n\nPS: Do you know better/more simple tutorial?

Download [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org) and use it for most anonymity critical browsing. Find tor.exe binary in its directories and autorun it at computer startup and use 127.0.0.1:9050 SOCSKS5 as yet another second level proxy server (on Linux port may be different like 9150). You can use this proxy server and also above mentioned Shadowsocks/V2Ray proxy even on defined list of web sites using Firefox browser extension [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) or \"[Sidebery](/1LfvE91ZF18jdG3wW62Dw7NtfTZh737KPL/?Topic:1616849597_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS)\", set in its Options / Containers. - !!WARN: extensions are not safe solution though, because for example if browser is restarted to the Troubleshoot mode without extensions, then after start, pages are loaded directly without proxies (which are defined in browser extension like mentioned Sidebery). In this regard is better to use several browsers. Like Firefox for regular browsing, Tor browser for most sensitive and third browser for other tasks. Each browser has its own proxy settings & footprint. Good to style browsers differently not to confusing one with another.\n4. Use Firefox browser extensions that fake/randomize parts of your browser fingerprint, block trackers/[Ad agencies which try to build your complete profile](/1uPLoaDwKzP6MCGoVzw48r4pxawRBdmQc/data/users/1KuwwnkAtVrfnyhv8pyGRxLqzNZbEkJt2u/DEF%20CON%2025%20-%20Svea%20Eckert-%20Andreas%20Dewes%20-%20Dark%20Data.mp4).\nExample extensions to use: uBlock Origin, PrivacyBadger, DecentralEyes, Chameleon. Disable extensions that are not open source and that require too broad permissions - you may setup secondary Firefox profile which will use these risky extensions, and use this profile only for privacy insensitive browsing.\n5. Minimize or cease internet activities on smart phone or remove Google and other proprietary software marketplace. Block network activity of the software which should not need net. activity. Use alternative like F-Droid: https://alternativeto.net/software/android-market/\n\nOther ideas, written in different words, check topic:\n[Separating P2P filesharing traffic from normal internet traffic for anonymity](/1LfvE91ZF18jdG3wW62Dw7NtfTZh737KPL/?Topic:1572014442_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/Separating+P2P+filesharing+traffic+from+normal+internet+traffic+for+anonymity)\n\nINTERNET ACTIVITIES ANONYMITY PRACTICES:\n1. Separate sites on which you have account into several groups:\n. these who have your physical address, real name, credit card data - government portals, banks, e-shops\n. social networks\n. regular sites like forums\n. sensitive content like half-legal activities\nEach group has different username, e-mail and IP address used (different browser mentioned above in point 3)\n2. Set your web browser to generate random password for each site, it means increased security and decreased chance to link your accounts if your password hash leaks - https://haveibeenpwned.com . In Firefox it is done on page about:preferences#privacy\nSchedule export of your browser passwords for backup purpose. For example in Firefox it can be exported to .csv on page \"about:logins\" and then imported to KeepassXC password manager.\n3. use real world data like name, location only where absolutely necessary. Otherwise do not enter the data or [fake it](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=fake%20data).\n\nsimilar:\n[What is Your Strategy for Retaining your Privacy on the Open Internet?](/1EfLnw7GDXbZfJmGNoXGQ4XkuHGWkRZTMq/?Topic:1627479112_1GJc2vm4vJjAKsFoFJ2D3gGmKiRac2kfnz)",

Also it helps to anonymize your activities.\nWireguard is the next generation VPN software, it is not yet stable/tested as a OpenVPN though, but has its advantages.\n\nDownload and run [WG installer](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install) on a Linux server (Dedicated server or vitual server virtualized using KVM/XEN since OpenVZ & LXC needs different approach: [\\#1](https://github.com/Nyr/wireguard-install) or [\\#2](https://web.archive.org/web/20211006101419/https://d.sb/2019/07/wireguard-on-openvz-lxc)) with OS:\n    Ubuntu 16.04 or higher\n    Debian 10\n    Fedora\n    CentOS\n    Arch Linux\n\nyum install curl 2>/dev/null||apt install curl 2>/dev/null;curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/wireguard-install/master/wireguard-install.sh;chmod +x wireguard-install.sh;./wireguard-install.sh\n\nIt should present you with the wg config file to use on [client](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) computer (likely your home computer).\n\nNow the port forwarding/opening ports on server. You may care about this only if you are using P2P apps like Zeronet, Torrent, DirectConnect as it will allow you to connect much more peers when you set the P2P app to use opened/forwarded port. To setup forwarding, add/replace following lines in server's /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf (wg0 is my virtual network interface name):\n\nPostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 1230:1240 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.66.66.2; iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1230:1240 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.66.66.2; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.66.66.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source MYSERVERPUBLICIPHERE; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; ip6tables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\n\nPostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp -m udp --dport 1230:1240 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.66.66.2; iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1230:1240 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.66.66.2; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 10.66.66.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source MYSERVERPUBLICIPHERE; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; ip6tables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE\"\n\nyou should replace following parts:\n\n- eth0 is main network interface (command \"ifconfig\" or \"cat /etc/wireguard/params\" near SERVER_PUB_NIC)\n\n- 1230:1240 is the port range i want to open/forward\n\n- MYSERVERPUBLICIPHERE - your public IPv4 of the server\n\n- 10.66.66.2 is the address seen on the WG overview on the client or next to \"allowed ips\" in \"wg\" command output on server once tunnel is established.\n\nAnd after doublechecking all is right i restarted wireguard server: systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0.service\n\nin my client WG config file i use: AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0\n\n**IPv6** networking and forwarding necessary?

			"body": "What you will learn there:\n- how to migrate from Windows to Linux (Arch based Manjaro - but things may be partially applied on other systems too)\n- have fully encrypted system and boot partition (MBR will be left readable)\n- setup VPN/Wireguard/Shadowsocks + firewall killswitch\n- setup RAM based intelligent compressed SWAP (zswap)\n\n\nI hope my days on Windows are numbered and i am finally migrating to Linux for good. Currently i am finishing the migration and i came to the point where nearly everything is working on Linux. So i want to share whole guide.\n\nHere are the tips and things to note before you do migration from Windows to Arch Linux like Manajaro is. I have selected Manjaro, because it is ranked among the top of user friendly, latest software, good number of packages in repos, good support community, rolling release distribution without need to reinstall system.\n\nWindows to Manjaro migration notes:\n\nBackups: Save settings of the popular apps - ideally all apps, space is cheap and time restoring manually is expensive: (C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming ; C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local ; Documents, Images, Downloads, Music.., Program Files folder etc.)\n\nSet e-mail client offline and export its data to Linux supported format (.eml, mbox ?) and quit client\n\nsync/backup all data to external drive (unless you will be installing Linux on different drive than current Windows system drive)\n\nCopy ovpn and wg files to usb stick (if you are using VPN service)\n\nBootable installation disk: Use full Manjaro installation image to minimise the downtime. https://manjaro.org/download/ Make bootable USB stick using Windows software called \"Ventoy\" (by installing it and simply copying the .iso(s) to the drive or using software \"Yumi\" (i used it), some people recommend Rufus.\n\nWhen ready to reinstall (having backup of the drive, or ideally install on different drive), try to boot from Manjaro USB disk. Maybe you will need to hit F12 old Fn+F12 to select boot source. Or F2, Fn+F2, Del keys to access BIOS and play with EUFI/Legacy, disable secure boot or change boot order.\n\nWhen booting up live Manjaro system from USB, you can play with it and then click Install. To secure data i ticked encryption. If adventurous, one can use custom partitioning, create new partition table MBR, /boot ext2 partition with boot flag 500MB, and then remaing space for example btrfs partition with / mountpoint and \"root\" flag. + tick encryption on both (i have not tested this, though btrfs has some advantages over default ext4 - if i install it, i would make sure to check mount parameters -o ssd , enable defrag, noatime instead relatime, space_cache by def.). Regarding swap some people rather recommend not to create swap partition and later create swap file https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Swap_encryption#With_suspend-to-disk_support\n\nAfter finished, maybe it will not boot from drive, maybe you will need to change boot order in BIOS or such settings.\n\nIf selected encryption, then it will accept passphrase. Make sure to enable num lock and using right keymap (y/z) etc. After submitting password by Enter key, it can take a minute or so for it to do something.\n\nNow you have booted into the newly installed Manjaro system.\n\nHave laptop, but using external monitor? Prevent closed laptop lid to turn off external monitor:\nsed -i \"s|#IgnoreLid=true|IgnoreLid=true|g\" /etc/UPower/UPower.conf;sed -i \"s|IgnoreLid=false|IgnoreLid=true|g\" /etc/UPower/UPower.conf;sudo systemctl restart upower.service\n\nRandomize MAC on each network connection?\nright click Network manager icon in tray (icon that manages net. connections), Edit connections, your connection, Ethernet, Cloned MAC address: random\n\nIn my case i setup VPN first to secure and anonymize internet activity:\n\n1 - WIREGUARD:\nUsing NetworkManager (GUI) tray icon disable OpenVPN connection if active and disable it from main network interface also using NM GUI.\nsudo pacman -S wireguard-tools\ncd /path/to/wg_conf_and_ovpn_client_files\ncp -p wg-client.conf wg0.conf\nnmcli connection import type wireguard file wg0.conf\nsudo wg;ip r;nmcli connection;for ip in $(curl -L http://cpanel.net/showip.shtml 2>/dev/null);do echo $ip && whois $ip|grep -i netname;done\nsystemctl enable wg-quick@wg0.service;systemctl status wg-quick@wg0.service (if fails, list units and use correct name: systemctl ) - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/WireGuard#NetworkManager\nNot working? https://snapcraft.io/install/wireguard-ammp/manjaro\n\n2 - OPENVPN:\nNetworkManager has new connection import entry to import .ovpn file.\n\n3 - SHADOWSOCKS:\nsudo pacman -S shadowsocks-libev shadowsocks-qt5\nFrom Manjaro menu, type shadow and run the SS gui app and add your connection configs in it. Make the app to start at boot and set one connection to autoconnect.\n\nVPN KILLSWITCH (prevent leaking unsecured traffic when VPN/WG is off):\nufw status\nufw was disabled, i used iptables killswitch rules from https://internetlifeforum.com/security/8687-how-setup-linux-firewall-iptables-ufw-prevent-leaking-non-vpn-connections/\nThough that page shows also rules for ufw. or try:\n1. https://internetlifeforum.com/security/8687-how-setup-linux-firewall-iptables-ufw-prevent-leaking-non-vpn-connections/\n2. https://www.ivpn.net/knowledgebase/222/Kill-switch-using-the-Uncomplicated-Firewall-UFW.html\n3. https://www.ivpn.net/knowledgebase/238/WireGuard-Kill-switch.html\nand once traffic works, saved iptables (Arch/manjaro) + enabled iptables:\niptables-save > /etc/iptables/iptables.rules;systemctl enable iptables\nUFW backup files are btw. in ls /etc/default/ufw/ ?\n\n// End of securing network activity\n\nSetting up SWAP file + zswap (i am not using partition, but if you already use swap and want zswap, possibly first disable existing swap: swapon & swapoff path & rm path & remove from fstab):\nsudo pamac install systemd-swap;sudo systemctl enable systemd-swap.service;mkdir -p /etc/systemd/swap.conf.d/;echo -e \"zswap_enabled=1\\nzram_enabled=0\\nswapfc_enabled=1\" > /etc/systemd/swap.conf.d/myswap.conf\nsudo sed -i \"s/zswap_max_pool_percent=25/zswap_max_pool_percent=70/g\" /usr/share/systemd-swap/swap-default.conf\n\nInstalling additional SW:\n1. sudo pacman -S wine-staging winetricks wine-mono wine_gecko qbittorrent transmission-gtk transmission-remote-gtk amule mldonkey nicotine+ whois veracrypt keepassxc clementine featherpad dolphin dolphin-plugins konsole packagekit-qt5 qt5-tools kdialog filezilla putty gsmartcontrol glances sysstat dstat mtr nmap gnu-netcat dnsutils recode appimagelauncher torbrowser-launcher wireguard-tools shadowsocks-libev shadowsocks-qt5 manjaro-printer baobab fdupes\n2.

If you have other distribution, you need to discover if your distribution has packages for zfs (and kernel modules).\n\nUpgrade and update system and reboot (in case new kernel was installed since last reboot)\n\nA)\nsudo pacman -S linux-latest-zfs\nreboot\nsudo /sbin/modprobe zfs\n\nif modprobe not works, try \"sudo pacman -R linux-latest-zfs\" and try method B:\n\nB)\nDiscover installed kernels:\nuname -r\npacman -Q | grep “^linux”\n\nand install zfs packages for these:\nsudo pacman -Ss zfs|grep -i linux\nsudo pacman -S linux123-zfs\npamac install zfs-dkms\nreboot\n\n# enable zfs support in kernel (it was not enabled in 5.8.16-2-MANJARO after reboot, but once enabled by following command it persist)\nsudo /sbin/modprobe zfs\n\n===================================\n\nOpen two pages and search for things and parameters to understand following commands:\nhttps://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.1/man8/zpool.8.html\nhttps://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.1/man8/zfs.8.html\n\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb|grep -i \"sector size\"\nSector Sizes: 512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical\n(smartctl is in package \"smartmontools\")\n\nIt was suggested here https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/how-can-i-set-the-correct-ashift-on-zfs.58242/post-268384 to use in the following \"zpool create\" command the parameter ashift=12 for drives with 4096 bytes physical sector size and for 8K physical to use ashift=13. If ashift not defined, then zfs use autodetect where i do not know how good it is.\n\n# attempt to create pool named \"poolname\" on a HDD of choice: (use disk that store no important data or it will be lost + unmount the drive, maybe using gparted)\nA) sudo zpool create -o ashift=12 -o feature@async_destroy=enabled -o feature@empty_bpobj=enabled -o feature@lz4_compress=enabled poolname /dev/disk/ID-HERE(ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/)\n\nor the same command only the pool will be created across 2 physical drives (of same size, else pool will not use all the space on bigger drive?) where one will be used for redundancy (recommended to reduce irreversible data corruption risk and double the read/write performance)\nB) sudo zpool create -o ashift=12 -o feature@async_destroy=enabled -o feature@empty_bpobj=enabled -o feature@lz4_compress=enabled poolname mirror /dev/disk/DRIVE1-ID-HERE(ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/) /dev/disk/DRIVE2-ID-HERE(ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/)\n(for 4 drives mirror, it should be: zpool create poolname mirror drive1id drive2id mirror drive3id drive4id)\n\nRegarding following parameter recordsize, it was suggested on places like this https://blog.programster.org/zfs-record-size and https://jrs-s.net/2019/04/03/on-zfs-recordsize/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/8l20f5/zfs_record_size_is_smaller_really_better/ that for large media files drive, the block size is better to increase from 128k to 512k. So i did it for my multimedia drive. Though above linked manual page for zfs says this value is only suggested and zfs automatically adjust size per usage patterns. Also is said on mentioned unofficial article that the record size should be similar to a size of the typical storage operation within the dataset which may contradict with the file size itself. \"zpool iostat -r\" shows the operation sizes distribution/counts, also if zpool is single drive, maybe can be used \"sudo iostat -axh 3 /dev/zpooldrivename\" and checking the \"rareq-sz\" (read average request size).\n\nCreating two datasets one encrypted one not:\nsudo zfs create -o compression=lz4 -o checksum=skein -o atime=off -o xattr=sa -o encryption=on -o keyformat=passphrase -o mountpoint=/e poolname/enc\nsudo zfs create -o compression=lz4 -o checksum=skein -o atime=off -o xattr=sa -o encryption=off -o recordsize=512K -o mountpoint=/d poolname/data\n\nfix permissions:\nsudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /poolname /e /d\n\ngracefully unmount the pools (i think necessary or poor will be marked as suspended and compute restart needed):\nsudo zpool export -a\n\nmount the pools:\nsudo zpool import -a\n(if it fails, you have to mount manually, list disk names (ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/), then: sudo zpool import -a -d /dev/disk/by-id/yourdisk1name-part1 -d /dev/disk/by-id/yourdisk2name-part1 )\n\nIf some pool is encrypted, then additional command needed (-l parameter to enter passphrase, else it complains \"encryption key not loaded\"):\nsudo zfs mount -a -l\n\npool activity statistics:\nzpool iostat -vlq\nzpool iostat -r (request size histograms)\nzpool iostat -w (wait/latency histograms)\n\nintent log statistics:\ncat /proc/spl/kstat/zfs/zil\n\nchange mountpoint of some dataset within the pool:\nsudo mkdir /new;sudo zfs set mountpoint=/new poolname/datasetname\n\nrename/move dataset (error \"cannot destroy filesystem has children\"):\nsudo zfs rename poolname/dataset/subdataset poolname/subdatasetnew\n\nattach new drive (if the existing one is non-redundant single drive, result will be mirror (something like RAID1, with enhanced read/write and 1 drive fault tollerance, data self healing), if existing is part of mirror, it will be three way mirror:\nzpool attach poolname existingdrive newdrive\n\nDetach, remove, replace, see manual page (man zpool) or https://zfsonlinux.org/manpages/0.8.1/man8/zpool.8.html\n\ncreate snapshot:\nzfs snapshot -r poolname@snapshot1\n\ndestroy (delete) all snapshots (no prompt):\nsudo zfs list -H -o name -t snapshot -r POOLNAME|sudo xargs -n1 zfs destroy\n\ndestroy (delete) dataset (no prompt):\nsudo zfs destroy poolname/enc\n\ndestroy (delete) whole pool (no prompt):\nsudo zpool destroy poolname\n\n========\nIf you are OK with the HDD activity to increase at times regular activity is no/low, then consider enabling automatic scrubbing (kind of runtime \"fsck\" that checks files and even can repair files on replicated devices (mirror/raidz)). Following sets the monthly task:\n1. su;echo -e \"[Unit]\\nDescription=Monthly zpool scrub on %i\\n\\n[Timer]\\nOnCalendar=monthly\\nAccuracySec=1h\\nPersistent=true\\n\\n[Install]\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\" > /etc/systemd/system/zfs-scrub@.timer\n2. echo -e \"[Unit]\\nDescription=zpool scrub on %i\\n\\n[Service]\\nNice=19\\nIOSchedulingClass=idle\\nKillSignal=SIGINT\\nExecStart=/usr/bin/zpool scrub %i\\n\\n[Install]\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\" > /etc/systemd/system/zfs-scrub@.service;exit\n3. systemctl enable zfs-scrub@YOURPOOLNAMEHERE.timer\n\n========\nAnother page worth reading: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ZFS\n\nTerminology:\nZIL - ZFS intent log is allocated from blocks within the main pool. However, it might be possible to get better sequential write performance using separate intent log devices (SLOG) such as NVRAM.\nSLOG - It's just a really fast place/device to store the ZIL (Zfs Intent Log). Most systems do not write anything close to 4GB to ZIL. (cat /proc/spl/kstat/zfs/zil). ZFS will not benefit from more SLOG storage than the maximum ARC size. That is half of system memory on Linux by default. SLOG device can only increase throughput and decrease latency in a workload with many sync writes.\n\nARC - Adaptive Replacement Cache is the ZFS read cache in the main memory (DRAM).\n\nL2ARC - Second Level Adaptive Replacement Cache is used to store read cache data outside of the main memory. ... use read-optimized SSDs (no need to mirror/fault tolerance)\n\nCache - These devices (typically a SSD) are managed by L2ARC to provide an additional layer of caching between main memory and disk. For read-heavy workloads, where the working set size is much larger than what can be cached in main memory, using cache devices allow much more of this working set to be served from low latency media. Using cache devices provides the greatest performance improvement for random read-workloads of mostly static content. (zpool add POOLNAME cache DEVICENAME)\n\nInteresting utilities:\nZREP is a ZFS based replication and failover script https://github.com/bolthole/zrep\nSyncoid facilitates the asynchronous incremental replication of ZFS filesystems https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid#syncoid\n\n========\nZFS zpool file statistics (file size, number of files):\n/decko/\na) zpool iostat -r;zpool iostat -w\nb)\n[code]find /decko/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l | awk '{  n=int(log($5)/log(2)); if (n<10) { n=10; } size[n]++ } END { for (i  in size) printf(\"%d %d\\n\", 2^i, size[i]) }' | sort -n | awk 'function  human(x) { x[1]/=1024; if (x[1]>=1024) { x[2]++; human(x) } } {  a[1]=$1; a[2]=0; human(a); printf(\"%3d%s: %6d\\n\",  a[1],substr(\"kMGTEPYZ\",a[2]+1,1),$2) }'\n  1k:   8102\n  2k:   2938\n  4k:   2169\n  8k:   2102\n 16k:   2311\n 32k:   2986\n 64k:   2533\n128k:   2164\n256k:   2146\n512k:   1692\n  1M:   2284\n  2M:   4512\n  4M:   7483\n  8M:   7890\n 16M:   4184\n 32M:   1911\n 64M:    484\n128M:   1461\n256M:   4911\n512M:   2344\n  1G:    578\n  2G:    113\n  4G:     13\n  8G:     11\n 16G:      2[/code]\n\n/ecko/ZN:\n[code]find /ecko/ZN/ -type f -print0 2>/dev/null| xargs -0 ls -l  2>/dev/null| awk '{ n=int(log($5)/log(2)); if (n<10) { n=10; }  size[n]++ } END { for (i in size) printf(\"%d %d\\n\", 2^i, size[i]) }' |  sort -n | awk 'function human(x) { x[1]/=1024; if (x[1]>=1024) {  x[2]++; human(x) } } { a[1]=$1; a[2]=0; human(a); printf(\"%3d%s: %6d\\n\",  a[1],substr(\"kMGTEPYZ\",a[2]+1,1),$2) }'\n  1k: 403007\n  2k:  33644\n  4k:  48356\n  8k: 155711\n 16k:  62305\n 32k:  52709\n 64k:  47308\n128k:  44223\n256k:  35698\n512k:  32049\n  1M:  34376\n  2M:  22291\n  4M:  38327\n  8M:   8134\n 16M:   2448\n 32M:   1346\n 64M:   1948\n128M:   1438\n256M:    379\n512M:    276\n  1G:    124\n  2G:      3[/code]\n\n\n",

It is the question whether this proposed (in Article 13) active approach of removing copyrighted content is a good idea. And if it is good idea to force all big web site owners to develop and employ censorship tools that are likely not perfect in content recognition and are energetically demanding. Moreover by approving Article 13, you will force them to scan all kind of content, just to catch tiny amount of content that is copyrighted.\n\nIt is already possible to quickly remove copyrighted content from sites like Youtube, Google Search. It is not needed to force all big website owners to rewrite their software to employ computing power hungry tools that will analyze ALL large media content of all users. I hope this strange Article 13 is deleted.\n \n----\nBTW, anyone knows the list of article 13 copyright directive supporters (MEPs) and their e-mail addresses?\nIt seems major supporter is for example

Users should be allowed to upload and make available content generated by users for specific purposes  of  quotation,  criticism,  review,  caricature,  parody  or  pastiche.  This  is  particularly important  to  strike  a  balance  between  fundamental  rights  in  the  Charter  of  Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the freedom of expression and the freedom of the arts,  and  the  right  to  property,  including  intellectual  property.  For  these  reasons,  these exceptions  should  be  mandatory  in  order  to  ensure  that  users  receive  uniform  protection across  the  Union.  It  is  important  to  ensure  that  online  content  sharing  services  operate  an effective complaint and redress mechanism to support these uses. \"\n\nWhich seems positive, thought i would guess overfiltering would win over users right to upload content?\nAt same time seems contradicting when they are making content providers liable for the uploaded content (which makes them develop upload filters/upload monitors) and at same time say that general monitoring should not happen:\n\n->\n\n- \"7.  The  application  of  the  provisions  in  this  article  shall  not  lead  to  any  general  monitoring obligation as defined in Article 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC.\"\nand\n- \"The  obligations  established  in Article  13  should  also  not  lead  to  Member  States  imposing  a general monitoring obligation. \"\n\n\n[Here is](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/e-business/directive-2000-31-ec) Article 15 of that 2000/31/EC Directive:\n\n\"Article 15\n\nNo general obligation to monitor\n\n- \"1.

There is an attempt to use [ZFS on Windows](https://github.com/openzfsonwindows/ZFSin).\n\nRelated quotation ([source](https://serverfault.com/questions/239832/zfs-like-alternatives-on-windows)):\n\"If you need the storage to appear as a native Windows drive - for a database, for instance - iSCSI is your only option.
