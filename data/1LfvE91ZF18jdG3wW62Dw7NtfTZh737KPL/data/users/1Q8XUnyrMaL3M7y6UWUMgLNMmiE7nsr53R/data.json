			"title": "SPHINX: A Password Store that Perfectly Hides Passwords from Itself",
			"body": "http://spies.cs.uab.edu/sphinx-a-password-store-that-perfectly-hides-passwords-from-itself/\n> Our password manager has several interesting security and usability features including: \n> 1. Resistance to offline dictionary attacks under server compromise (or server being malicious). \n> 2. Resistance to phishing attacks. \n> 3. Resistance to offline dictionary attacks under device compromise (or device being malicious), in particular hiding the userâ€™s master password with information theoretic security. \n> 4. Resistance to eavesdropping and MitM on the device-client channel without the need to establish a confidential channel (the properties of the OPRF protocol executed over this channel ensure that no externally protected or secured channel is needed).\n\nThe paper is available from here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/695.pdf\n\nWhat do you know about this password manager?",
