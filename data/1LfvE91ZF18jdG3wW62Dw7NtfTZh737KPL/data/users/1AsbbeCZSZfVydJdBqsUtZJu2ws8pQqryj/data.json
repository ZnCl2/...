				"body": "I have W10, Ubuntu 18.04, and MXlinux all running fine on one 1tb hard drive, had absolutely no problems with it - I did however not uninstall W10 before I installed Ubuntu (which I use almost exclusively).  I simply booted up a the Ubuntu distro in the USB drive (after adjusting the bios of course) and shrunk the W10 partition down to about 40gb - it still runs and updates fine (it's bone stock though, I have no use for any Microsoft shit - the only reason I still have it there is because I paid for it) I was even able to add an additional 16gb partition to check out the distro of the week, 16gb for fully decked out Ubuntu 18.04 - and lots of room to spare on it's own partition. /home is on it's own partition 902gb with 22gb swap partition Grub takes care of all the boot files - just turn the thing on and select. I have 11tb external drives for data hoarding - and windows can't even see it!! :)  no support for ext4 - fucked up windoze, pay all that money for it and it so fucked it doesn't even have support for that :(",
