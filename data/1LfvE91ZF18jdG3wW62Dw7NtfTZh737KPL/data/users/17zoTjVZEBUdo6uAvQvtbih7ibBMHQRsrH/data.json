DirectX depends on a hardware implementation, there are some GPUs that don't even support the entire DX extension subset (e.g: 9.3, 10.1, 11.3 (iirc)). you can however \"emulate\" up to DX11.3 by telling the directx control panel (vista(?), 7, 8, 10) but its slow. idk the purpose of what you are trying to build but you should look into more modern GPUs as you may also want to run vulkan or OpenGL 3.3+ apps.",
