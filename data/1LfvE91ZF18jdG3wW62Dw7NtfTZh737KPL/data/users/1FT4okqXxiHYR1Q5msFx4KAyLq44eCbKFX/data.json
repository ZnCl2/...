Linux is amazing specifically BECAUSE you learn a lot about how yout System works... either build your AUR Helper(prefer paru to pamac btw, check it out) from scratch or don't use the aur... Because packages from the AUR are not... Installed. its more a makepkg ---install, which is essentially a $ make \\ sudo make install or rather a make build && sudo pacman -U $(ls | grep tar). Oh, and if you use ' instead \", there's no need to escape the string. \n\nBut Cloud in Linxu is awesome, you can even use something like IPFS or rent your own Debian Server and use that as a Clous store.\n\nFREEDOM",
