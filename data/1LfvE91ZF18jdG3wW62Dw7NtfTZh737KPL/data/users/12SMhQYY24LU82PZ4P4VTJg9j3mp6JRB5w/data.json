Competition is bad for the market from the perspective of already established enterprises and, thus, they will do anything ot secure their power. The clearnet is centralizing into an oligopoly; this isn't surprising though, the internet is actually one of the last places to congeal capital into a unified mass.\n\nLook at the media industry, or the banking industry. Most companies in those industries are owned by like 5 companies.\n\nWhat we need to libertarian socialism in which the economy is planned via technology and autonomous/democratic decision making. As long as we allow these same material relations to replicate themselves we are going to keep getting the same result.\n\nI know you say you don't \"like\" communism, but, the way the world is heading we are going to return to a type of super feudalism.",
