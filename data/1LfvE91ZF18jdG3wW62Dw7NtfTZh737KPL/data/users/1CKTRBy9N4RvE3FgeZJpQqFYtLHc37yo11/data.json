			"body": "Use tor impossible on palemoon ? Is Palemoon that Secure ?\n\nhttps://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=22341\n\ta copy on:\nhttps://web.archive.org/save/https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=22341\nhttps://archive.fo/sNoNj\n\t\n\tOn the page\nhttps://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=22321&sid=abb0c878b8073d4e24e1442f331a0dba\n(Captcha Cloudeflare)\n\n\ta copy on:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190619190433/https://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&sid=abb0c878b8073d4e24e24e1442f331a0dba&t=22321\nhttps://archive.is/ivB1R\n\n\nIt was asked why palemoon configured under tor (127.0.0.1:9050)\ncould not access addresses with a 'cloudflare service'.\n\nCloudflare blocks the 'exit node addresses' of 'the tor network':\t\n\t\tThese addresses are well known and are increasingly used as spam.\n\t\thttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets/master/firehol_level3.netset\n\n\nThe technical Question that Was Asked on this page was :\n- Can Palemoon be considered a secure browser ? Since it is now impossible to use it with the tor service, in more and more sites, sites using the cloudflare service ?\n\nThe question remains unresolved and as long as a TECHNICAL SOLUTION IS FOUND :\n- The Answer is NO, Palemoon is no longer Secure.\n\n\n\nExamples of increasingly common and important addresses, websites that have subscribed to 'the very restrictive Cloudflare's service':\n\nTry running tor, set palemoon for tor (127.0.0.1:9050), palemoon or any other browser.\nAnd you will see the growing number of sites now using 'Cloudflare's restrictive service'.\n\nExamples for technical addresses revolving 'only around palemoon':\nwww.palemoon.org\nhttps://addons.palemoon.org\n\n\n\nWhich is CRAZY BUT COMPLETELY CRAZY,\nIS THAT 'TECHNICAL SITES' HAVE BEEN CAUGHT 'IN THE CLOUDFLARE TRAP':\nwww.unixmen.com\nwww.linux.org\nlinux.die.net\nlinuxconfig.org\ncyberciti.biz\nchmodcommand.com\nlinoxide.com\nlinustechtips.com\nforum.xda-developers.com\nfreedomhacker.net\t\t\t\thacker lol.\nuserscripts-mirror.org\nviralnews.fossbytes.com\nvoat.co\t\t\t\t\"a community platform where you can have your say.

Because you're looking for free speech. Why free speech? Because it is decentralized, so the word can't be controled.\nCloudflare is bad because, it is an intermediary, One more on the long term that already exists on the Internet, and that makes the Internet dead. And that it will not rise from its ashes like the phoenix. \nThat's why I work hard with others to make it clear that people who try to revive something that's dead have morribund behaviour. They behave morribly because they are always under the spell of this highly controlled society on all kinds of aspects that the quidam has no idea of.\nLong enough answer?\n\nPS:\nIt would also be nice if people could do their own education themselves. Instead of asking people like me. It would avoid me repeating myself for decades. Or having to write this on tablets that eventually become the sacred texts, that emerged here and there for all civilizations. Thanks.
