It's theoretically possible to implement a crypto-based DNS over BitTorrent DHT.\n\nA DNS resolver can be made as a OS-level service, so it works transparently for the apps.\n\nOne can change IPs and hosters for their web site at any time and has no dependency on ICANN etc. At the same time, it still looks and feels like a classic web in a browser, not like ZeroNet.",

Just use a USB stick with any Linux live distro to boot and reinstall the boot sector.\n\nI have Windows + 3 Linux distros + FreeBSD on a single SSD installed. GRUB is used as a universal boot loader. BTW, GRUB is able [to boot FreeBSD kernel directly](https://www.linux.org.ru/forum/talks/14937054), no intermediate loader needed.",
