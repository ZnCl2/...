Every single time communism has led to a massive centralization of power. I'm all for decentralization of power. [...]\n\nThey're two sides of the same coin, but I disagree about the decentralization of power. Under communism, a totalitarian state would often need to be in place to keep it together. In late stage capitalism, the tyranny has been outsourced to the corporations and the state is powerless to stop them. The centralization of power comes from the corporations buying out the competition and buying politicians. Libertarians and free-market types want to defend their neighbor's right to have a little family business, but then they get wrapped up into defending Amazon and Walmart coming in and running the competition out.\nThe reason capitalism won in the A/B test that was the Cold War was in part because it is less about brute force oppression and more about soft power. Deplatforming by threatening demonetization and public slander. When that stops working, as we've seen it becoming more common, we start seeing the state being leveraged by the corporations, bankers, and media as a bludgeon to intimidate dissidence.",

The only hint I have is how much sites break when cross-site scripts and resources are being blocked by uMatrix. If you want to be an asshole, you can try Ad Nauseum, which will block ads but also send \"fake clicks\". Instead of denying them clicks, they just think you clicked absolutely everything you've ever been shown, which clogs up your habits.",
