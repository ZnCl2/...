			"body": "Add your favorite search alternative to google and how is your experience with it.\n\nI know of following\n\n* [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/) - log free google search proxy without filter bubble\n* Over 50 [searx meta search engine instances](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/wiki/Searx-instances) - They are very good combining results from google, bing, wiikipedia and about 70 other search engines. Many also have onion url.\n* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) - personally I do not find DDG search quality inferior to google. Its just different but I get what I want plus DDG is much less censored than google. Good thing about DDG is that it have [onion url](https://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion) also.\n\nBut most of the time, its better to search concerned website directly like [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/), [torrent search engines](http://127.0.0.1:43110/unblocked.bit), [libgen](http://libgen.io/) etc. or visit website directly once you have visited a website once and bookmarked its url.",

Now, even though you connect to VPS via tor but still your exit node is your VPS as 4th node.\n\nIf google do not ask for phone number while creating account than its fine otherwise VPS is of no use for getting google account anonymously. A phone number is static and more personal information than ip address.",

				"body": "> [ssdifnskdjfnsdjk](#comment_11_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS): \nYou mean to connect it via SSH or VPN? I do not think there will be any logs of either one, because i am deleting them as i mentioned in step \"8.\" For SSH it is /var/log/lastlog (unsure if that is all needed, more) [...]\n\nNo, I mean you have purchased your VPS anonymously using bitcoin and tor and now you are connecting to it directly. Your VPS provider now knows you purchased it. Even if you delete logs from your VPS but your VPS provider and ISP also have logs. Even if most VPS providers do not actively observe what their server are being used for still they have logs like who connected when, resource usage of each VPS with timestamps which is more than enough for both VPS provider and authorities if they raid the server.\n\nStill not keeping logs on your server and deleting data from VPS regularly is a good idea. For example, if your VPS is your mail server than in case of raid, very few mails would be found if you download your mails to your home email client than delete from server regularly. Also send and receive mail by first encrypting them on your home computer and not VPS.\n\nAs you are using your VPS as VPN, you should setup a onion service on it. Since its a linux server, you can do it same way as you would do it at your home computer. Route the incoming data from your onion service to your VPN on server. At home instead of using server ip and port to connect to VPN, use onion service address and port.\n\n> [ssdifnskdjfnsdjk](#comment_11_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS): \nGmail is very good webmail in my opinion, but i agree if one expose his/her e-mail address and want to stay private, probably some e-mail provider with \"no-logging\" policy can be better. [...]\n\nFor personal email, its best to set it up at home. If can't for some reason than at your VPS. For anonymous email those \"no logging\" protonmail or tutanota would be better than google. Both because they promise not to scan and profile you based on mails and they have far less reach throughout the web than google. It would be much harder for them to track and identify you than google. Though they can also not protect if your adversary is some *powerful* government.",

				"body": "Nope. Tor is very good for browsing clearnet websites. Most websites support https nowadays but not all websites support automatic upgrading of http to https connection. Many links are specified in http form probably because at the time of writing those articles website did not support https but now do. Default tor addon 'HTTPS Everywhere' work on very few and popular websites only. Use addon like 'Smart HTTPS' to automatically convert http links into https links. but in its setting set really long delay to \"When switching to HTTPS, if loading takes longer than 3000000 milliseconds, revert the protocol back to HTTP (default is 3000 ms). \"\n\nThis way you know which connection are not encrypted. http connections are bad both ways whether you browse them via tor or directly. If you explicitly browser non-https websites without tor than you are leaking your browsing habit to your ISP more than in case of https websites as they not only know website address but the page you visited. This give them enough clues about what you do via tor. In tor also it have similar effect but instead of ISP, its exit node. But this is less of a problem in tor because exit nodes still cannot know your real location if *webpage* is not about very narrow regional topic or language. Even than tor node switches every 10 minutes and is unique for each website by default. Much bigger risk with exit nodes is that they are more likely than ISP to inject malware in http page although most exit nodes are good nodes. So set your noscript security setting to 'safest' to block all scripts.\n\nSome [tips on browsing via tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#warning) that you may already know like do not login to personal accounts via tor or better to not have at all if you can avoid.",
