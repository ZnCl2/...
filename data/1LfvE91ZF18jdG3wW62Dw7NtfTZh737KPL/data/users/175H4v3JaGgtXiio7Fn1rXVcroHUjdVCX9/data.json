However, the phone can be replaced with an online service.\n\nSo an attacker having access to your device, or your keyboard, can still intercept `pwd`. But for each service you use a seperate key `k` is generated and stored on second device, so you will require both `pwd` and the device that stores the service key `k`. I think it could be better with more minimal hardware but it'll work if you already have a phone and a computer laying around. It is better than entering your master password on the same device that decrypts or generates a password for a service, because if your device is compromised, which is likely, all your passwords belong to them.",
