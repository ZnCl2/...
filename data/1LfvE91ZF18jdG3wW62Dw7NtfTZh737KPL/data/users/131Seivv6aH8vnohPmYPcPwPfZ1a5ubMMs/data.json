				"body": "Currently Firefox is just my secondary browser (with Vivaldi as primary), so I'm not deep into Firefox add-ons. In addition to basic security / privacy ones already mentioned (HTTPS Everywhere, uMatrix etc).\n+ [**Dark Reader**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/darkreader/).\nMakes webpages dark. to stop my retinas being burned when browsing at night. Unfortunately it's not perfect. Especially, it doesn't catch a lot of FF's own \"internal\" pages, like interstitial windows, error pages, add-on manager, so my eyeballs frequently get blasted.\nOpen source, says it doesn't collect user data.\n+ [**Torrentz2 Magnet Links +**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/torrentz2-magnet-links/). \nRestores magnet URIs and .torrent links to the Torrentz2 search engine, plus a few other tweaks.\nOpen source licence and only accesses data on Torrentz2 domains.",
