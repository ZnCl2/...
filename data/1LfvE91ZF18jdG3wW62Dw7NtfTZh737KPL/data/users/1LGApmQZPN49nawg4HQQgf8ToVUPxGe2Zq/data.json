DC++ clients are mature, although there are some vulnerabilities, mostly DoS, which got quickly patched. More information is available in DC/DC++ developers blog: https://dcpp.wordpress.com/",

Until then the copyright police can play there game of carrot. Its a game they play with newbies.\n\nDC++ uses direct connections, without proxying/tunneling connections of other users. This is not a security problem or a vulnerability, this is per design, just as BitTorrent, ed2k or even ZeroNet. You may use proxy, VPN or any other method to cloak your IP address if you wish.",

I wanted to link someone to a directory of many files so he can download whole directory easily\n\nThat's not possible to give magnet to directory since directories do not have TTH hashes. It's possible to give magnets for all individual files though.",
