			"title": "Is it possible nowadays to bypass the mobile internet speed limitations?",
			"body": "Nowadays I have got 50 GB monthly + 150 GB during the night (00:00-00:06) mobile internet traffic.\nAfter I run out from the given traffic, everything is slowed down, currently there is no content specific slowing, but there was in the past with another mobile internet service provider. I had a mobile internet with unlimited browsing and with unlimited e-mail. By using VPN, there were no limitations, because due to the encryption, everything appeared as web browsing on the side of the service provider, so there were months, when the mobile internet traffic was more than 1 TB. But nowadays I live in another city, and I use another mobile internet service provider with no content specific speed restriction, so everything is slowed down after running out of the given traffic. Is it still possible somehow to bypass the speed limitation given by the mobile internet service provider?",

A well prepared hacker can (are able to) do many things. Nowadays I do not even need public Wi-Fi. I have a mobile Wi-Fi, and I can use that during my travels.",

Laptop, PDA, Smartphone, tablet, etc. Maybe even some of the gaming consoles, for example the PlayStation Portable (PSP), or the Nintendo DS. Maybe you would not even notice the hacker in the crowd, even if you would see it.",
