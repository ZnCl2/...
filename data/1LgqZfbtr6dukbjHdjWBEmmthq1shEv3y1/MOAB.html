If you don't browse with care and land on a site or view media of questionable legality, that's on you. This site only tries to help you be safer. There may be sites and users the admin missed.

MOAB blocks sites, hubs and users for requesting, distributing or allowing child pornography (camera imagery, not lolicon), doxxing, scams, spam and/or terrorism, glowies trying to infect your devices and/or honeypot, career trolls, and sites that would run CoinHive without your knowledge. The most obvious scammers aren't listed, so use your brain. If you think MOAB should have a wider scope, you should respond by creating your own blocklist. It might get linked with a detailed description if it's good. MOAB is cloneable.
<p>
This site will never block any sites nor users for sharing different ideas of history, people, politics, environmentalism, economics, and/or culture, meaning that this list is not pandering to SJWs nor racists. Bias and conflict of opinion would be detrimental to the trust and usefulness of this blocklist. You may have noticed a tutorial "How to Censor ZeroNet." That was a prank intended for pro-censorship newbies to block themselves. This list isn't for protecting anyone's fragile feelings, including mine.
<p>
This site does not provide any means to access the blacklisted sites. Site addresses are forward-hashed, therefore you and I are legally immune under any possible circumstance.
