Blog about newest political events and some political views.
<hr><hr>
There will be listed and updated information about sites with far right political contents. I shall try to update information and add new relevant links. This activity is inspired by numerous attacks on right political sites and facebook accounts. The censorship of leftists will be broken!<br>
The site is created in democratic country and is intended to be read by free mind people. As I understand, democracy means "Government by the people". How can people, citizens of one country make a decisions when some super duper moral gang decides what is allowed to speak and to know for citizens? Think twice before defending censorship, one group moral superiority over another, political correctness and other demagogic shit. Things have gone too far. Now lights will be turned at those, who have managed to treat publicity as their own and private territory. Any site can be closed, especially when such prominent players as Google, Facebook and less prominent hosting services act united. But, don't you afraid that the spring will have too much power when it get loose after it has been squeezed too strong? It looks like political opponents are very sure of their justice because there are many of them and they have full mainstream support.<br> This is what happens sometimes. Few intellectuals create story of 'what the world should be', some capital holders actively support ones ideas, and that it is, just keep your mind for yourself if you don't agree. No mater how you will say what you think, you will always be shouted at your face that mainstream thinks other way. Maybe you are feeling strong while being in the congenial crowd, but this is not about your strength or rightness. This is about being a sheep in a big herd, all howling the same voice and peacefully marching to another historical Armageddon. Social laws, just like laws of physics or mathematics, doesn't stop acting if one decides not to believe in their existence as they are 'politically incorrect'. Social engineering, performed by fools, lairs and mercenary people, will have inevitable consequences.

This site is anonymous, but does not prompt to violate laws of any country. Illicit correctness activists uses law or are trying to aggressively ruin any discussion using public pursue for critical opinion on some 'undiscussible' nowadays 'truths'. They trying their bad education and lack of intelligence make the most important and valuable attribute of our western culture. The anonymity sometimes can help. I hope our discussion can help to stay rational in often irrational crowd...
