One of the main 21 age attributes of political life and international relations is strict control and big sensitivity to national sovereignty, human rights, territory and borders security, minorities rights protections. It is not bad times we are living in. At least part of us.<br>
After big and disastrous wars and technology revolution big countries are more interest on social stability and economical grows than seize new territories and grow crop in there.
It is the same tendencies in the Middle East. Really it is. Israel after it was given territory by occupational forces was engaged in few wars with Arabs. As it was given for free it was fun to have more and take more for themselves. You can say that it was a defensive war. In some way it was. It is not so simple having in mind that Jews had no country and that the land was given to them despite the complex history and disputes with Palestinians.
In 1967 6 days war Israel has occupied the whole territory of Palestine. It was a defensive war for Israel. Now these territories are the most inhumane place close to the Europe. 
Jews are working hard to make 4 millions Palestinians to evaporate from the Earth surface. The houses are taken from Palestinians, they are restricted in moving within their neighborhood by bloc-posts. They are punished for their states bad politics despite the fact that they have no state nor government.<br>
People are often telling their stories trying to incorporate all historical facts, Hezbollah, Jews security issues, Russia and USA interests, Iran influence and of course the holocaust. The more you are capable to include the more you are successful in hiding oppression of Palestinians. The 4 million people and the territory where they used to live for God knows what time are the thing that should be hidden from the worlds attention. And it is done! What a strange thing is happening: no human rights activists, no international laws, no Arabic solidarity. Just nobody capable to notice 4 million people.
If you do not own some territory you just build your houses there and send your army to protect them. This is new order of the 21-st century. It is Jews order. Don't you waste your time to try to understand it. You will not unless you take into account Jews philosophy how they should treat other nations and how much they invest in lobbying in the USA.<br>
The interesting thing is that the most effective media that has given the best picture about Palestine is the witnesses of Jewish soldiers. Only 12 minutes of <a href="https://documentaries.io/film/israel-breaking-the-silence-dw-documentary/">video by Deutsche Welle (!).</a><br><br>
The article in the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/08/israel-soldiers-speak-out-brutality-palestine-occupation">Stories from an occupation: the Israelis who broke silence.</a><br><br>
The site of ex-soldiers Breaking the Silence, <a href="https://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/">link here.</a><br><br>
The problem deserves much more attention than it is given. It may be the result of some people love to negotiate and to manipulate to make some things not to be found or to be pushed out of the publicity.
