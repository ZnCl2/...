<h1>Two Russians accused of Skripals murder attempt</h1><br>
<br><div class="main_text">

It was quiet obvious that Russia is involved in murder attempt in Salisbury. The fact that it was quite obvious in the time of hybrid war. Once I have discussed with friends what kind of clues can be gathered to proof Russia involvement. I thought that if intelligence of one country is determined to engage operation in another country and is determined, has enough financial and human resources, it is quite a great probability that it will succeed and leave no remarkable traces or get caught by hand. And I was wrong. <br>
The democratic country has the problem, that it is not enough that its intelligence has clear understanding whose responsibility is hostile operation, but is necessary the citizens having voting power to have clear understanding what is going on. Other way the government will not take serious actions as public usually do not like politics playing games that require big money or may lead to military conflicts. this is the weakness that Putin's Russia is trying to exploit. Russia's media, both for domestic and foreign use was furiously denying Russia involvement. It was not hard to guess it will happen and it seemed poisoning in Salisbury will stay in the greyzone: somebody is sure, somebody have opinion, somebody is creating crazy theories and government has no strong motivation to take any serious action.<br>
And I was wrong.<br>
This time Great Britain has made his job nearly perfect. The whole Russian operation was investigated as under the microscope and put to the public judge in such manner that even the most stubborn opponents had to recognize the facts. Russian agents ‘Ruslan Boshirov’ and 'Alexander Petrov' were not caught by hand. It was even worse for Russia. Russian media have created its justifying story and even more: president Putin have nearly sveared that those two are not GRU agents. Risky way having in mind photo with clear face characteristics were published from Salisbury heros.<br>
<i>“That’s the information he has,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. “The president said these people were civilians. This means he voiced information that had been reported to him.”</i> (<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/439667-petrov-boshirov-civilians-kremlin/">link</a> to the article russian propaganda site RT)
 And then the real name of GRU agent is announced.<br><img src="10_4.jpg"><br>

 GRU Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga ‘Ruslan Boshirov’<br>
(Article in <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/26/skripal-suspect-boshirov-identified-gru-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga/">https://www.bellingcat.com)</a><br>
You can look at this howewer you want, there's no way you can call it wictory of Mrs Putin.<br>
Of cource the Great Britain position is not the event that can make you wonder. It has never been pro Russian. Can you imagine the same scenario involving Germany?. There are good news, but there are remaining big problems in The Western world also.<br>
<br>
And one more interesting opinion about the conflict betwean Russia and West. It is the question how long Russia will try to hit without the risk of being hit back. It is the way with no chance to win or even withstand. West is like the box coach who is strateging box mach tryng to motivate boxer to block more competitor hits believing that this is right strategy to win mach even if you are not hitting back a single strike. Is this the illness that can be treated only by WWIII? <br>
Is there way to come to the right decision when CNN is trying to fight for civilisation pushing #metoo problem various aspects, sort of "man with wrong look at woman 30 years ago", shocking, cosing sleepless nights or nightmares for the most people who think they are well educated and progressive and certainly global. What is the future of culture, that is so involved in hedonism, that even words or touch 30 yers ago is the main problem of the sociaety. I do not denie the problem of unadequate sexism or even Trump bad manners, but is it more important then security problems? For some people politics, even the worlds scale politics, is the club, belonging to which makes you more fashionable and popular person and therefore it is the place where one should try to get. You must try to make politics to fight sexism, to condemn Trump, to take down confederate monuments in America and do everythink that you think will make you more popular and what make you get more likes in facebook or twiter. What else politians can be? It is time when official stupidity or media proposing stupidity is new norm of free democratic world.
