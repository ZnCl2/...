<h1>The Great Period of Lying</h1><br>
<br><div class="main_text">
<img src="17_1.jpg" align="right" hspace=50 vspace=50> An interview of Douglas Murray and Peter Robinson about the fate of Europe, migration, madness and weakness of politicians. Douglas Murray is an author of bestsellers <i>The Madness of Crowds</i> and <i>The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam.</i> The whole interview is 47 minutes length. Have a good time.
Here are some citation from interview:<br>
<br>
"Europe today has little desire to reproduce itself, fight for itself or even take its own side in an argument. By the end of the lifespans of most people currently alive, Europe will not be Europe and the peoples of Europe will have lost the only place in the world we had to call home"<br>
<br>
"By 2015 more British Muslims were fighting for ISIS than for the British armed forces. 
In 2016 the most popular boy's name in England and Wales: Mohamed.
By the middle of this century a majority of Austrians under age of 15 will be Muslims."<br>
<br>
"At the same time Europe has lost faith in its beliefs, traditions and legitimacy. Europe is now deeply weighed down with guilt for its past. And there is also the problem of an existential tiredness and a feeling that perhaps for Europe the story has run out and anew story must be allowed to begin."<br>
<br>
"The universities are working as transmission belts for lunatic ideas."<br>
And one very funy and sharp: "Germany wants to lead masochism."<br>

<br><br>
Some serious events are waiting us in near future. While Europe negotiates with Iran, the USA calculates possibilities, watches his enemy and strikes. Very peaceful union will try to proceed with negotiation with very very very angry Hassan Rouhani. Hard times for EU leaders has come.<br>
