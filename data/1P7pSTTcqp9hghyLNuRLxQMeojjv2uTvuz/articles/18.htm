One more time about Greta. It looks very odd as political or social activity when you are 16 year activist who are so active that your photo is on The Times, give speeches in UN quarters, in government institutions of various countries, and simultaneously you are so fragile that you are guarded and supported by anonymous people when you are on Stockholm streets. This video is exactly about this. How it looks like when you are trying to ask questions of Greta Thunberg. Main stream media represent Greta as brave and relentless activist against climate change. She sacrifices her childhood and education. She takes participation in small events in the streets and in meetings with her peers. She looks serious and efficient. Her comrades-in-arms respect her. She also gives official speeches in official institutions of state or world importance. These speeches are of two kinds: type a - speeches reading from list of paper, b- speeches that are well learned from list of paper and never free live speech and serious discussion.
It is funny when Greta is described as intelligent, independent player. It should not be problem for world famous activist to answer few questions. Do you agree? Yes? No, it is not so simple.<br><br>

Simple question, no answer. Do somebody believe that her speeches are not written by someone else?
I do not know if there are more unanswered question by Greta. But I can give you a link to video to show what is done to avoid uncomfortable questions:<br><br>

<i>"Greta's rise was facilitated by worlds elite. Campaign to canonize Greta as a saint in the eyes of the worlds leftist Zoomers and Boomers alike... was coordinated, orchestrated and executed nearly flawlessly: nobody has bothered to dig deep into the rise of her messiahhood..."</i><br><br>
You can be world famous for fighting against pollution and high carbon dioxide emission and still incapable to answer few simple questions in the same time?! Even if they are not supportive or very friendly, shouldn't it be place for discussion? I am trying to be positive, but I do need some proof that you are not just text reading parrot. What kind of fools are sitting in those institutions like UN, if they can afford themselves to take part in such a performance? 
It is not a problem the performance itself, it is a problem that after a few years of Greta's public activities still there is not much known about her supporters, who clearly are literate and capable of speech writing, wealthy and influential enough to pay bills for yacht trips and first class journeys. Do you think it isn't important? Then what is important?<br> Civilization is looking for the best ways to survive threats for its existence. It is one simple question: why there are cycles of cold and warm climate and how much we are responsible for that? It is clear that human being and CO2 pollution is nothing to do with the ice ages and warm periods that happened before homo sapiens have evolved. Such a simple question is considered to be politically incorrect. We need some answers. I would like better to be silence before I will here an answer, then this stupid noise. And no, I am not so naive to think that we should not to stop CO2 emission or to try to diminish its amount in atmosphere. I would feel better if there were more knowledge, more true leadership, more competent politics, more sincere and not dogmatized scientists. Maybe the first time in the whole history we have to act united as civilization, not as separate countries, cultures, tribes and political parties. All what is about Greta seems to be senseless noise and nothing more, unless it does make profit for somebody of course.<br><br>
And by the way. It appears that school strike means that you don't go to the school, where to go there is no obligation as it is school for children with special needs...<br><br>
