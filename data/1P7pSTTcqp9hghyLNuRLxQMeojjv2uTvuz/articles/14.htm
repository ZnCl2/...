<h1>Greta Thunberg</h1><br>

In old times while still was learning in my school I was amazed how can such society as German nation make such a horrible think as second world war. The reason for wonder is not moral aspect. the reason is rationality aspect. How people could became so indifferent to their own well-being and even lives of their loved ones. We where taught to analyse the reasons and processes that have lead to the war. I could understand why leaders make such decisions driven by their eccentric characters, fight for having more power, loss of simple precaution not to make devastating errors. Even as a student I could understand that one man, can make an error. Still I could not understand how the whole society can allow one persons wrong idea to become the main course of the whole country. This was my impression of learning history: people do harmful actions for unknown reasons without any caution.
That was long time ago. I have seen enough of stupid things. Einsteins words about infinite human stupidity does not seem strange. <br><br><i>Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I’m not sure about th’universe!</i><br><br>
That is history. Now it is nothing different. Adolescent from Sweden Greta Thunberg is world wide famous fighter for stopping climate change. Her fight consists of school strike, emotional speeches in UN, EU parliament, attends environmental activists meetings <a href="https://freewestmedia.com/2019/08/10/greta-thunberg-has-journalists-thrown-out-of-meeting/">(highly emotional of course)</a>

Your new prophet

It's hard to understand why somebody must speak in so emotional way reading the text in the paper. Hasn't she read it before? Is this coincidence, that her father is an actor? So if Greta was in her school she probably wood participate in some activities like schoolchildren theater. And what if you do not go to school's young actor club? Then you go to the UN headquarters, sorry, you sail on the zero emission yacht and make your performance there. The performance is called 'You Have Stolen My Dreams and My Childhood'. By the way, two sailors had to fly by plane to US from Europe to bring back 15 million worse yacht. Despite the fact that she missed her classes, she have learnt some things: If you want to tell people about the need to reduce carbon emission you need to emit more carbon dioxide then you would if you would stay at school. So the question how to really reduce carbon emission remains misty and maybe Greta will answer it after she graduates the school.
<br>
It does not imply trust on environmentalists capabilities to make some sensible action.
You can read more critics on Greta Thunberg here: <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/how-dare-you-you-have-stolen-my-dreams-and-my-childhood-teen-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-unleashes-tirade-at-un">theblaze</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/opinion/climate-change-greta-thunberg.html">nytimes</a><br>
  Another problem is that all those loud voices of environmentalists that say their arguments are proven by scientist is simple lie. Now well, I do not deny the CO2 role on climate change. The problem is that the climate has changed all the time. What about ice-age? What about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/11/ancient-fossil-forest-found-antarctica-gondwana-spd/">tropical forests in Antarctica?</a><br> 
All that had happened without human influence. How anyone can be sure that climate change is about 'we must stop it', maybe it is more about 'we must adopt to it'? Everything what is done to save climate is just new ways to make more money for somebody. It is extremely hard or even impossible to turn our actions outside high profit way. The best solution may be far from not flying jets or making electrical cars. Who are the people who can be really far-seeing? There are many pretending to be, many just advocating somebody's businesses and many illicit activists for sure.
<br>
There's no need to listen to angry teenager. Simple initiative to reduce CO2 emission may be insufficient because of political issues. Such countries like China and India are among the countries with highest emission rates. And they will not risk to reduce economical growth just because Greta has told. And that is only one reason to fail. There are many solutions that may help.
