<h1>The New Cold War</h1><br>
<br><div class="main_text">
It is not so easy to write something new about development of novichok case, while whole internet and main TV news channels are full of information about expelled Russian diplomats from the most European countries. Letts see which EUcountries did not expel  diplomats. So lets list them:<br>
Austria<br>
Bulgaria<br>
Slovakia<br>
Slovenia<br>
Cyprus<br>
Malta<br>
Luxembourg<br>
Greece<br>
Portugal<br>

Some countries in the list have long history of being loyal to Russia. The loyalty in the context of bold attact on allie country looks strange. It is not the case of some complex relations, some political disput. It is aggressive and clearly not provoked. What are trigers for actively declared solidary for those countries if novichok isn't? Are they asleep or just hypocrite? Does Greece feels any solidarity? There events when Greece itself needed the financial help. Doesn't it count on military support and deterrence from NATO?<br>
Is Cyprus only the place for Russian investing or something more? <br>
Austria appears to be the place of some strange politics with love to Russian money, indifference to EU collective politics and sarcasm on Eastern and central Europe problems.<br>
There are good news also. Germany and France are expelling 4 diplomats each. Merkel and Macron expressed clear support for UK and condemned Russia. There were no murky political correctness, hezzitation and waiting for evidences. It seems to be a game changing point. The time will show if solidarity still exists in Europe.
Politics is an art of predicting events and making the most possible profit for ones country. There were plenty of bad politics, made by naive and diletant politics. <br>
Lets say Merkels immigration politics and her trying to force other countries to take part in that fatal gamble violating any law on borders controll of EU and Shengen zone. Stupidity to help immigrants after they sail on boats thru Mediteranian sea and die, leaving thouthands of corpses on the shores. Isn't it weird and cynical for immigrnds and stupid for interests of other EU countries? Or Holand, fooled by Russians in Mistral case. There were plenty of signs of agressive Russian behavior directed to its neighbours. France was willing to be supperior state that can ignore dangers that keeps aware other nations. The result was showing clear incompetence and loss of quite big money.<br>
And now, in Solisbery case, hope still exists that even Germany and France are cappable to oppose Rusia.
There were tens of declarations how everybody is afraid of the new cold war. Hasn't it already begun? Isn't it better then a peace when Russia thinks it can use chemical weapon in NATO country?<br>
