Another story about social engineering. How could it happen? <br>
Now it is side effect of cautious content filtering related to some really undesirable content as cp or other lowlifes stuff. Facebook as one of the most important site of manually added user's contents, is researching limits, how far it can influence the behavior of it's client's. Facebook, when it was created, had reached unexplored world. If we are talking about any other way of publishing private content on the public or partially public internet, lets say blogs, texts in forums or something like that, the content could be supervised by moderator manually. The huge amount of textual and visual information makes it impossible to supervise the system manually. No one had been faced such a problem before. Here comes artificial intelligence with its huge possibilities. Information was always valued. The hygiene, law and public knowledge about putting private information and managing it on the net are still evolving. <br>
How should be treated user agreement forms on the net, stating in one of few dozens statements, that user agrees that information may be shared with third parties? If you sit down by PC and make any digital agreement with some service provider is it moral for provider to ad such statements that it can share any data with someone else? This is not the only question. What about using the information within the service, but not the way user suppose the data to be used? Why should I see advertisement selected personally for me? You may think this is not bad thing, but why I should be under google's 
surveillance? Have I agreed somewhen to be so? Sorry, I do not remember. Any agreement have its expiration date. What is expiration date on yours agreement? Can anybody count service providers, that collects information about yours behavior in internet?<br>
The problem is not my agreement made. The problem is about what were my expectations. This is how deals are made for example in bank, when client signs agreement on credit contract. It is highly recommended to read every word in the contract text, but if the bank puts some doubtful conditions that lacks relation to the main subject and harms client interests, they even can be discarded by court. So what relation is between google's service as search provider and logging my searches? <br>
The fact of collecting information is highly underestimated. Even if it is collected legally, how the harm can be compensated if it has been used in wrong way? Now Cambridge Analytica may be accused of meddling Brexit and USA president election. Lets say, it will be found that they are guilty. How they can compensate the harm they made? No, they can't. Even theoretically. So that means that they can't have possibility to make such actions. They can not have information, that can be used to create so detailed users profiles. It must be forbidden the same way as carrying automatic rifle in the center of the city for the same reason: the harm that can be imposed is too big to wait to happen. Talking about the intentions, purpose, reputation has no sense. Facebook have failed. The harm made is too big. Detail personal information is too important to be handled by irresponsible businessman.
I am using search engines that do not trace more and more often, even if results are not so accurate and abundant. <br>
I have met too many silly people in my life and I do not want one of them to manipulate my decisions.<br>
Tor and ZeroNet are great!
