<h1>Germany as the worlds biggest problem</h1><br>
<br><div class="main_text">
Or Germany as the biggest wolds problem?
Every nation is unique. So there is no doubt that one of the richest countries in the world is. It may seam impressive how country, once fully destroyed in the WW2 has rebuilt itself and created economy and economic prosperity for its people. How could the society, once engaged into the most effective fighting and killing machine of all times, to become the backbone of peaceful Europe, the main country in EU?
Definitely it wasn't so simple to become leader. As all leaders do, you should eliminate the opponents. It had to kick out UK, to become the only power, capable to dictate EU politics. But this is another story.<br>
   For now lets talk about this miracle.<br>
As an adult man, I should say that actually I do not believe in miracles from my early childhood. This 'miracle' is not an exclusion. 
The leadership in EU seems mainly leadership for 2-3 countries, the club, where main questions are discussed and decisions are made in the name of EU. 
For example to invite people from North Africa to swim on inflatable boats over sea and than, those who have not drawn, to force settle in various countries.<br>

   Mrs Merkel likes black humor, doesn't she? Doesn't this remind the enthusiasm of creating concentration camps in WW2? The same sense of superiority over other countries and nations, even over German nation itself. It seems that declaring 'higher' moral standards than others, no matter real or imaginable, gives the right to force others to obey. Merkels higher moral standards creates quiet unique decision making standards in the EU: if you are Merkel and think that you are right and you are saving the world, you just need to say others what they must to do. It looks like Germans are not capable to talk to others another way.<br>
   And in the other hand, if you are making business and have profit, you have no moral obligations. You can have deals with anyone, as you are the Moral itself and it is not hard to have a deal with yourself. Who cares about Russia's war in Georgia or Ukraine? Merkel does. She is worrying very much. Who has a doubt about that? She is 'discussing' about this in all her private meetings with Mr. Putin. And she has many meetings as it necessary to discuss how to defend North Stream from US sanctions, Iran and all EU itself. Nobody else can help Merkel so much as Mr. Putin can. She do not care about the fact US have proposed Marshals plan for Europe after WW2 and Russia was the Allie of fascist Germany before official beginning of WW2.<br>
   The only fact that Germans want the world to know about contemporary Germany is that Germany and it's fascist past has no relation at all. It looks like this wish is so strong, that actually it makes Germany look like ... fascists from the beginning of the 20th century. The only difference is that Merkel, unlike Hitler, is so incapable politician that nobody knows what she will do next. Or contrary, maybe that means that it will turn into another German stile world or Europe disaster. Does anybody in Europe have a sense of danger when influencial politicians are so weak and lost in their values?
