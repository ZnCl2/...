<h1>Fundamentalists are killing France</h1><br>

On march 16th in France had happened the event that could be the critical moment to change dreaming laziness of Western Europe. 
Samuel Paty, the teacher of 47 year old was decapitated because of showing caricature drawing of prophet Mohamed.<br>
The constant killings, stabbings in the name of 'god' is usual in Europe. It is in the past time when you could feel free in your own country. Now others feel free. The reason why they feel free is bad education, pure IQ, stupidity and aggressiveness. Nothing impressive. What about Europeans? Now well, they are sissy as usual in our times.<br>
There are plenty of proof that multiculturalism is utopia. The culture itself is the 'way of majority', the way of thinking, values, traditions, religion. The sense of culture is to make interaction between people simple and predictable as much as possible. That is the reason why the word culture is used for. The word multiculturalism means the same as 'culture when there is no culture'. Multiple 'cultures' doesn't mean culture, because if people in tight spaces acts in the ways when their action is not acceptable and understandable to bystander, it can not be called 'culture'. It contradicts to the sanity.
The modern liberals have reached deep waters and just are beginning to understand, that they just can't swim.<br>
Emanuel Macron is just realizing that the problem is not only big, but the problem needs to be addressed. The beheaded teacher is a problem, that can not be concealed. But knowing that you must act, doesn't help to find a solution easily. <br>
It is hard to ques how the problem looks like in the liberal head. It is obvious that the time is coming when there will be less and less people who dare to speak freely what do they really think. Imagine how the life looks like for teacher in the West. You know what is free speech, you know that this is one of the most important values of western civilization. Imagine that you are standing in front of some Muslim children of various descent. You don't know who are their relatives. Will you dare to say what you think about Islam fundamentalists? And if you don't, what another message can you send to the Muslim children? No message? Or even further, how far is the time, when you will choose to keep silence about your own preferences, family history, your country, your beliefs just because your are afraid for your life?<br>
This time, I think is already now. Another teacher will take place of the killed one. Will he have enough courage to talk about Charlie Hebdo and free speech? Now OK. He may have. But if not? Isn't it how dark ages look like? Will this teacher condemn China for its human rights violation? Isn't it funny to look for justice in another side of the planet if you are afraid of your own life in your homeland? Will France keep living its life, or will it be living its life a little bit another way? The way, that suits a bit more, that helps to feel more safe, more silent, without being afraid of being stabbed, with some compromises of free choices, even if such life is going downhill? The only thing you need is just be silent and to be more conformistic. For now.
The all refugee madness has advanced so far, that there is no simple solution.<br><br>

Mrs. Merkel where are you? What should Europe to do? Will we need to find solution without you? I think Mrs. Merkel should say a few words here. She is highly related to refugee problem as I read somewhere some time ago I think...<br><br>

Meanwhile Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemns France's anger and call for justice. It seems like a bad dream. Turkey is declaring that it will boycott French goods...<br>

bbc.com:<br><i>
In a televised speech, he urged world leaders to protect Muslims "if there is oppression against Muslims in France".
Mr Erdogan has angrily criticised French President Emmanuel Macron for pledging to defend secularism against radical Islam.

<a href="https://barenakedislam.com/2020/10/31/watch-how-pakistani-women-are-teaching-their-junior-terrorists-in-training-how-to-behead-the-french-president/">In Pakistan women teacher (that one who is opressed by man...) is teaching children how to decapitate Macron.</a><br>
Maybe one of them will become a refugee and arrive to Europe. How can you stop people who is seeking for better life? You can't! It is not humane!<br><br>

Liberals are killing Europe. The way how they are doing it is sophisticated enough to have potency to make problems unbearable.<br>
Europe is becoming a sissy-land. It is very sad about this.<br><br>
And by the way, boycott Turkey. I meen it. They deserve it.
