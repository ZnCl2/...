<h1>Will Salvini save Europe?</h1><br>
<br><div class="main_text">
Not so long ago, on 22  of January, Germany and France have signed renewed friendship treaty. Just look at them how neat they are:<br>
<img src="13_1.jpg"><br>
I am worrying haven't they lost their mind to play games in sand box while the USA and Russia drops nuclear weapons treaty, European cities are flooded with criminal bands and Britain is going... sorry, nobody knows where they are going. J.C. Juncker has said that the rest politicians are seeing too much of such private Franco-German parties, but still it would be worse if Germany and France would disagree on important European challenges. And yes I absolutely agree with that, it would be hard for those mad leftists to act if they were alone. (Now, unfortunately, it is hard for all the Europe.) 
It is unclear what they will do being friends. None of them is doing any hard try to make something sensible. Will they do the same being together?<br>
<br>
<i>“(The threat) comes from outside Europe and from within our societies if we are not able to respond to the growing anger,” Macron said.</i> <a href="http://myconnection.cox.com/article/world/8c0799f6-1e28-11e9-87b4-36c57d77e7ea/">(link)</a><br>

It is hard to understand what did french voters think, when they voted for Macron. I do not even talk about Germans. For one hundred years they are making things, that are mainly evaluated in millions of dead. It is in their blood. Even madam Merkel has no need to wash her hands after meeting with Putin. It looks like when few generations are rich enough to waste their time to choose what restaurant to go and spend their excess money, people become irresponsible and stupid the same way as drug addict are. When most of the nation are not solving life threating problems for half a century, they become lazy. They fight terrorism with flowers and chalks.<br>
<br>
I do not like impotent leftists politics so loved in nowadays Europe. It is interesting to watch Merkels or Macrons clumsy, purblind reactions to Trump's shocking behavior. Someday Macron was proud about his firm handshake with Trump. Poor guy. He do not understand what politics is. He was hiding in nice palace from people dressed in yellow vests, before he signed such nice treaty with Angela. And he has been thinking that he was superior to Trump.<br>
Soldiers in Paris have patrolled some time ago because off foolish immigration rules and real terror and death fear. Of course this was presented as active and right measure to solve problems. Poor people do not noticed that political problems were solved using French army in Paris. French people think that this is not the army patrolling in the streets and not the problems, just some complex globalistic-humanistic phenomenon, which should be treated quietly and stoically.<br>
Meanwhile Trump is using his army on the Mexican border, denying spongers entrance to US. Barbarian, isn't he?<br>
<br>
But that was clear long time ago. What was not so clear, that is Matteo Salvini.<br>
<br>
<i>MILAN (AP) — Italy's interior minister on Tuesday called the French leader Emmanuel Macron "a terrible president," in comments that were sure to further add to tensions with Italy's trans-Alpine neighbor over immigration.</i><br>
<br>
<i>"If Macron is so good, he can prove it with facts by letting in thousands of refugees who are in Italy and whom he promised hospitality, with other European countries,"</i><br>

It is the first time when Germany (!) has been called "other European country" doing stupid things. A. Merkel was so engaged in Trumps disaster, that had not bewared being stabbed in the back.
Interesting events are waiting us in near or not so near future. What should happen Germany and France to start solving real world problems? Will that be neo-nazies to take their place, as other right politic forces are punched out?
