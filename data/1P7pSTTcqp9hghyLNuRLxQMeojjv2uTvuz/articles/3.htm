<h1>One more murder in UK</h1><br>
<br><div class="main_text">
<i>16 March 2018 UK police have launched a murder investigation after the death of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in south-west London.</i><br>
There are still 13 or 14 in the row. I believe some will be found murdered. I do know the precedent of such mass murdering executed by other country in UK, or any other Western country. Considering Russian intelligence is involved, you can imagine how creative they can be by means of concealing evidences. Even if victims are in very specific relations with Russia (all or most may be considered traitors as they are former officers of intelligence services) there is too much frightening circumstances. Poison gas is not so easily controlled to poison single person in town center. It was unsuccessful: spies daughter and policeman have been poisoned too. What is the probability that in some unpredictable circumstances there would be dozens of victims? Is that possibility that Russians doesn't think off that? Doubtfully. This may be more important goal (or effect) of the operation, than to harm one ex spy. Seams like new border line between UK and Russia is somewhere in Salisbury. So are you loyal enough to Mr. Putin? Now well, this may not help if the usage of poison gas would go out of control, but still you should think about that...<br>
Meanwhile... Mr. Corbine is urges to wait a little bit till forensic experts will find some more evidences, maybe lost visit card with FSB sign (it must be checked if found for not being counterfeited of course) or something else besides Novichok poison gas.<br>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/15/salisbury-attack-conflict-britain-cold-war">The article in The Guardian: </a><i>"However, that does not mean we should resign ourselves to a “new cold war” of escalating arms spending, proxy conflicts across the globe and a McCarthyite intolerance of dissent. Instead, Britain needs to uphold its laws and its values without reservation. And those should be allied to a foreign policy that uses every opportunity to reduce tensions and conflict wherever possible."</i> I do not understand what possibilities do you have when your opponent is in cold war with you already. You have no possibility to choose diplomacy any more. There is no such thing as choosing diplomacy over war when you are already in war. Unless your countries positional retreat does not harm your political career for some period of time. This is more about political creativity to notice when usual 'good willingness to the whole world' politics has become funny, and acting politicians have to create new directions. You can not benefit from repeating old truth any longer. There were period of time while there was no need to fight for something. Mental laziness is still the main trade mark of some prominent politics. How nice times have been, when you stand up and say your ordinary 'lets live in peace and harmony', everybody applauds, you feel so happy and so professional.<br>
I don't know how UK's Defense Secretary's <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/salisbury-attack-defence-secretary-tells-russia-to-go-away-and-shut-up-11290722">words</a> "go away and shut up" were estimated by his colleagues. For me it sounds really well. Even if it is not gallant, it's new way of thinking when old measures clearly do not work any more. It is right to do something new to stun some daring arseholes. It is the way of seeking new approaches and new limits. That is how world changing politics is done.<br>
What gentle words can stop Kremlin politicians? Lets look for example at Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman. He is clearly nice, polite, well educated man, that would not make shame for any western party. It is natural how deeply he is shocked about rough Gavin Williamson's words. You can find this guy well dressed in quite expensive suit, wearing quite expensive watch, spending time on expensive yacht. Lets talk about his watch alone, that cost's to much to be bought and there's no declaration that it was a gift. Actually his watch costs for times more than his annual income. And that is watch, how about yachts, houses... What chances are that this man will be part of honest foreign or social politics? It seems that the lie is his second name. He have no way back. That's how mafia works. He will never retreat, he will never step back way for any democratic forces. The same is with mister Putin. Maybe, just maybe, he had possibility to choose his way after first month after being elected president for first cadence. Now he clearly have no possibility to step back. He guards his band. His band guards him. Nobody is allowed to betray and stay unpunished. It is not state's business. It is personal and vital. It is always important to understand why things happen when they happen. Polite talk is not what makes things easier. Polite, weak, politicians with no initiative are just raw meat for Kremlin's. They are not partners, never were. There was time when it was plausible and useful for Kremlin rulers to be considered West partners. It appears now that even most stupid one understands that it can not be any longer. Good news is that Putin's wish being kept invincible is from his weakness and lack of choice and not because he is strong, independent leader. The Western step back would be completely irrational.
