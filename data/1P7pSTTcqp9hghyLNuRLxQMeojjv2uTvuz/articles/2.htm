Will prince Williams be stopped from going to Russia, to watch football world cup?
This was one of the possible answers to Skripal murder discussed. I can understand, someone should be punished for murder using military mass destruction guns in the UK. Why not Williams?
I would like to share my own view.<br>
We should keep in mind that cold war rules are back. Thereâ€™s no more hopes for good will from Putin and Russia. Exactly this way: both, Putin and Russia. There's no difference between those two. Russian foreign policy have never changed since 1917 revolution. The western have had much hope, especially related to reset button (it is out of order now due to intensive use).
The end of USSR was the time when western people decided that there's no need to spend much resources for defense needs. That is quite reasonable. When your enemy weakens, you don't need so much money to spend for military or intelligence. More things had happened. The right, conservative, aggressive politics was no longer popular. New political leaders have come to scene. They fought for integration, human rights in every corner of the world. They stated their goodwill to everyone, especially old enemies. This is kind of logic. You make friendly gestures and expect friendly answer despite past disagree. That is what all of us do in our lives. Despite my favor to that politics, time to evaluate results are coming. Those, who were considered being potential friends, appeared to be a little bit changed old enemies.
Of course you can oppose to me and say, that Putin's politics was friendly some time ago. He have had many meetings with his western colleagues, they had common goals such as <del>terrorism prevention</del> or ...(actually nothing more, and not even terrorism as it is not big deal for authoritarian Putin with huge intelligence forces and no humanitarian or peoples right barriers, but let's go on further).<br>
So... <br>
Now we are in big trouble. The killing of one (some say up to 14) man of 50 million is not big deal. Many more people die in car accidents. Besides it is not even an 'accident', and it is a small risk to happen the same to you personally as most of you are not ex Russian spies anyway. The problem is that besides the western superiority over Russia is prominent, western countries are loosing their ground. This process is lasting for quite long time and the process is quite intense. I miss the light on background of Skripal arrival to UK. He have arrived after spy swap. Another swapped spy, living in Russia now, is Anna Chapman. Intelligent business is specific, hard and dangerous. That is why the state takes care of own spies when they are in trouble and when spy cases are brought to the light and denial of state involvement have no sense. We need to mention that Russia is much better in that: it's loyal spies live longer. Isn't it worth to mention, the fact that the Russia is gaining superiority in such brutal action? Of course there's no evidence of Russia involvement in Skripal's death (as in Litvinenko death or few more deaths of ex favorites of Mr. Putin)... It still may appear to be unknown phenomenon of genetics, or environment pollution, or voodoo, or something even more weird than voodoo...<br>
And even more awkward is absolute naivety of western leaders to be surprised by such unfriendly action. Why should all of us be waiting of such aggression?<br>
My answer is Russian Mass Media.<br>
While western leaders shaked their hands with Mr. Putin, Russian internet and TV was shouting about aggressive NATO, EU, USA politics. They were revealing conspiracy theories of preparing to invade Russia, preparing to change its 'constitutional' government. Do you know how the place is called where Russian soldiers were killed in Syria? 'Russia's far reaches'. The place in Syria near Deir al-Zour, have such relation to Russian territory. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/russians-dead-battle-syrias-east-173442627.html">(article in English)</a> That's new political approach, that you didn't know. Now you will. Have I to mention that even more near approach to Russia is Eastern Ukraine, Eastern EU and NATO states, Alaska, Northern Pole, Balkan states, Moldova, Belarus and other Russian neighbors, since now - UK also. There is long and intense work done by Russian media to make every child to know that Alaska is actually Russian. Have anybody noticed that? Have anybody read Russian sites dedicated for Russia, analyzed them? Have anybody asked question why media, mainly belonging to government, is posting such articles? Media in the country, which will soon become friendly, just it is needed the button to be pressed numerous times, some political concessions be done and that's all.<br>
I can understand that Merkel didn't notice. She had much business to do to grant gas supply. But what about others?
Why well educated western politicians suppose that their opponent is from the same culture? Actually he is not. He is just the guy from Leningrad, and not from the the nicest part of it.
