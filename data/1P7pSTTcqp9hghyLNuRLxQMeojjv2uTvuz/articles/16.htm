<h1>How You Can Fight Mad Leftism</h1><br>
<br><div class="main_text">
<img src="16_1.jpg" align="right" hspace=50 vspace=50> Some time ago I have found Jordan B. Peterson. I have found it while looking for some interesting texts about psychology. I am interested in this and I like to read or to watch podcasts about that.
First thing that I have been drawn into is his book <i>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos.</i> This is bestseller and really worth reading it. I sincerely recommend it to everyone. 
Once I have found Jordan Peterson I tried to find out some more info in the Facebook, YouTube. Things that I have found were so interesting, that I was involved in watching and reading maybe for a month. And sorry for this title. It is too rude for such contents and the mind depth of the man this text is dedicated to. This is not about fighting it is more about being conscious and ideology resistant individual.<br><br>
I have some links in my PC about leftists in the universities and there fight for equal possibilities for both genders ignoring any factor of competence. One or two articles that I have found is almost nothing compare to Peterson's adventures in Toronto university. Actually it started not from equal rights but from an interesting jurisdiction act called c-16. The bill adds "gender identity or expression" to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code. The way you can violate someones rights is refusing to use special newly created proverbs according to transgenders preference. Now you must be careful telling someone he or she. You must remember how any self proclaimed gender representative wish to be called. If you say simply he or she you will be prosecuted. You must learn newly generated words, such as zie, hir, ey, em, eir and co. 
It is not the joke from facebook any more.<br><br>

It is interesting what's new in LGBT world and leftists crazy methods to support them, but even more I am interested in politics. I have found much interesting discussions where Peterson participates.
Its like treasure island If you want to hear sincere and comprehensive discussion of well educated, not ideologized participants. I have never thought it is possible to find discussion in YouTube of that quality and depth.<br><br>
