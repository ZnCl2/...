<b><p><a href="articles/16.htm">How You Can Fight Mad Leftism</a></p></b>
I want to share with you some especially interesting material about the famous psychology professor and best seller author Jordan Peterson. It is unbelievable sense to experience such a competence and firm stance, the way this man protects his values. This is clearly not within the main stream media range. Who wood dare to criticize feminism or radical left, or ideologized university campuses? He does this in such a manner that thousands gather to listen to his lectures and discussions. And this is not a show, this is a speech with tough arguments. I have never saw a discussions that are so actual and interesting ever before.<br>

An article in <i>The Spectator</i>. It is worth to read it. I have not so much to add. This is about why trying to understand and predict Putin's new aggressive steps is sometimes impossible if you are on the ground of rationality and decency. And one more theme on Russian media and how it should be treated. I mean both types for Russian media: domestic and for western export.<br>
