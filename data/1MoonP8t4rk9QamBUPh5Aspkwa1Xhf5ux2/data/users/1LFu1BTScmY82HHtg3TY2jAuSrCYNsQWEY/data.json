Some things (for the future) may also be that you could be able to use \"core\" ZeroNet protocol implementation easily for your custom application and without any additional frontend implementation (so that you would basically make your own custom frontend). Similar to how IPFS and some other protocols provide more \"low-level\" access which can be used to build custom applications easily.",

			"body": "> Wouldn't you just have a e.g. Rust/Go/C/etc. client that communicates with any ZOS implementation? I don't like the idea of running 5 ZeroNet instances because some frontend dev \"likes doing it that way\"\n\nI already made such ZeroFrame WebSocket client for Node.js and Python. But it would be also good to have them for other langauges and also to support some more features.\n\nI also agree that usage of separate ZeroNet instance for each application is not appropriate. However, I more though about that for more \"embedded programs\" that don't have to have classic UI and don't depend on browser/HTTP. Maybe some low-level command-line programs or maybe even the OS itself.",
