Don't spend all your time for someone else (especially your boss).\nIf you are missing one or more of these ten, then add them to your daily routine. It's okay to miss a day or two, just try your best! The first step to bettering the world is to better yourself.",

Hebrew idk much about.\nMost Attic texts are also available in Koine, which by itself also has many Byzantine texts not all translated to English or Modern Greek yet.\nMost extant Latin texts are in Ecclesiastical (which also borrows words from Koine Greek and Classical and Vulgar Latin).",

It is in Ecclesiastical Latin.\nToday, the offical Bible is the Nova Vulgata, and it is in Classical Latin.\nHope this helps! ",

No need for a ward, most people have thoughts like yours at least once in a while. Try living. And I don't mean eating, breathing, working, and sleeping. To be alive is completely different than just not being dead.",

Most people nowadays live as drones, paycheck to paycheck, never noticing whats around them or stopping to relax; people wonder why depression is on the rise, well sometimes it can feel like there's 4 walls around you at all times in this modern world. Fight back with self improvement, then work on helping your neighbors!",

A couple instances of ignorance aren't the whole, yet you focus on those only?\n>souls do not exist\nOh? Prove it then.
