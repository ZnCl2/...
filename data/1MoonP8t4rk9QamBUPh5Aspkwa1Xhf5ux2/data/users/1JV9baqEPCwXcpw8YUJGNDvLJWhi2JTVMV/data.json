			"body": "I have been using ZeroNet for a few months, and if I have to tell the truth I am really enjoying it. I like the ability to: create websites for free, write without censorship, you can write to other users (e.g. some problems), however many people only use ZeroNet for illegal stuff (free video games, porn etc ...), and second me it is a waste to use ZeroNet only for illegal things. In fact, many newspapers in my country write articles, saying that ZeroNet is the paradise of illegal things and no sites can be shut down, which makes me very sad. The conclusion I would like to say is that you have to convince people not to think that all peer-to-peer things were created only for illegal things.",
