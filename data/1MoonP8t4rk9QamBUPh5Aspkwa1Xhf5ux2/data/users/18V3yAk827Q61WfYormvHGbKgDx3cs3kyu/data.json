Meet diva.exchange - the first non-profit, non-corporate, very-small-tech and research-driven association developing \"Free Banking Technology - For Everyone\". All licensed under AGPLv3+.\n\nThe presentation is about the technology stack of the truly distributed free banking technology \"DIVA\". It's also about the fact that \"distributed technology\" does not offer anything like a \"business model\" in the old-fashioned-cloudy way. It's about the overlay network \"I2P\". It's about the distributed storage engine \"Iroha\" and the challenges with a very slow network. It's about banking business logic, the user interface and its challenges being fully distributed. And it's about the research co-operations in Switzerland.\nDIVA is small and local tech for everyone.",

Users can now download and seed eepsites. (Both ends needs to run eepHttpd ) \n\nThis serves simple static sites directly to i2p via the SAM API.\neepHttpd is the easiest tool for hosting new sites on the I2P network from your own computer(As long as they are mostly static sites, for now).\n You start the application and it sets up a directory in a logical place on your system. It has some neat features to make your sites available to people who want it even when you aren't available to host it.\n Probably the most cool thing that it can do is that it can mirror most github pages as long as they are statically pre-generated. The I2P Site itself is actually just a clone of the github repository, making the act of mirroring the site also the act of mirroring the source code. If you have an account at i2pgit.org or git.idk.i2p then you should use this to self-host your gitlab pages.\n\n Use this for things You want to SHARE ANONYMOUSLY with a large audience, not for things you want to keep secret. This allows people to clone the site in order to mirror it.",
