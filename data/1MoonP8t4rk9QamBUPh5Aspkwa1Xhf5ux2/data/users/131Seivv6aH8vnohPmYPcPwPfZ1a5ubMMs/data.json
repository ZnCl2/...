I think it's more about the all-time data limit for you on your home hub, e.g. default is 100kb. After you hit your limit, your posts will be visible to you but not to others. That's why I moved to KaffieHub (limit 10MB).\n.\nAnd there are hubs with even more space: [see hub list on ZeroWiki](http://127.0.0.1:43110/138R53t3ZW7KDfSfxVpWUsMXgwUnsDNXLP/?Page:hubs)",
