The anime's first season ending is quite weird, as it jumps from the third light novel to right before the seventh light novel (assuming the 7th light novel won't suddenly jump to a different point in time, as I haven't read it yet). The sixth book was made into a movie, so if a second season was to continue from the first season it would skip two books, and leave some major plot holes.",
