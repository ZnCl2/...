Right-wing conservative countries like syria, saudi arabia, malaysia, etc. crack down on freedom of speech, and are highly censored. China and Russia are good examples as well (both having highly censored internets, and being highly capitalistic and authoritarian).\n\nAnarchists are the breed you find here on zeronet and other decentralized platforms. We're against copyright (which is capitalist censorship), money in general, private property, government, etc. All rightwing ideals.\n\nWe're also against communists and socialists who you won't find here at all because they can't have control.

Instead you just sign content with your private key.\n\n*Do* note, however, that your downloaded sites *won't* sync between machines (unless you manually do it or have a script to copy the stuff over). Likewise any mutes/blocks/etc. won't transfer either. If you register new ids none of those will transfer (though you can re-copy the users.json file, or visit the site with the same master seed key).\n\nBut reading and posting will work simultaneously from as many machines as you'd like. Only the individual configurations won't sync, unless you have something syncing your files on your own.\n\nFor example say you copy your users.json file to your phone, which also runs zeronet. Your phone can now post on using your existing zeroid, as can your desktop/laptop. But then if you go on your phone and register a KaffieID, that creates a new keypair on your phone, but that doesn't sync to your desktop/laptop. You can transfer it by hand again, and on your laptop/desktop if you have the same master seed (which you should if you followed the example), visiting the KaffieID site will generate the same public/private key pair for the site, and thus you can recreate the cert. \n\nIf you visit a new site on the phone, the new site will not pop up on the desktop client. And vice versa. You can manually transfer these as well. Same for blocks, mutes, etc.\n\nZeroNet *does* have a \"multiuser\" mode, password screen option (to prevent people from accessing your webportal). So that you can host ZN on your private server, set it into these two modes, and then login to your zn instance from many devices and have everything synced. This is similar to how zeronet proxy services work (they set up multiuser mode and then point the client portion outwards and allow people to use their node to log in). In this case the instance is a single node, so when you update that node, your info is updated across all devices.",
