The objective seemed to be to galvanise & destroy the core participants of the NZ Occupy Movement.    \n\nAs the actions of the intelligence agencies became more extreme & dangerous, Suzie eventually made the decision to leave New Zealand. \n\nShe first moved to Berlin & then Russia, where she was recently provided with temporary asylum. I hope to be able to share news with you about the on-going 1vs5i campaign & share content on 0net & other online spaces. \n\nSuzie's currently broadcasting weekly live streams analysing the mission-creep of the \"Five Eyes\" alliance, based on the Snowden documents with intelligence scraped from the Internet & other surveillance apparatus provided to the \"Five Eyes\" from than 100+ countries. \n\nAt the same time the intelligence agencies & military-industrial complex has acquired a level of power so great, this cabal influences the decisions of numerous Western & International governments, seemingly unquestioned & completely unaccountable.  \n\nI would recommend the following recent YT live streams by Suzie as a good starting point:\n\n\nIntro video clip: https://peertube.co.uk/videos/watch/a388b4d7-41c2-4309-bfc0-9b761c692158\n\nPart 1 https://peertube.co.uk/videos/watch/5461f1e0-d234-442e-b756-ec6a779df88d\n\nPart2 https://peertube.co.uk/videos/watch/f87f02d9-6792-4c85-bb66-97340acad36b\n\nPart3 https://peertube.co.uk/videos/watch/4baed762-1b64-4cf2-8bb9-9e0c3685cfee\n\n& also a documentary in which Suzie gives an account of the covert harassment & surveillance she experienced before leaving New Zealand \n\nhttps://peertube.co.uk/videos/watch/9909d040-b1e9-424d-bdd3-8a0935743456\n\n\n",
