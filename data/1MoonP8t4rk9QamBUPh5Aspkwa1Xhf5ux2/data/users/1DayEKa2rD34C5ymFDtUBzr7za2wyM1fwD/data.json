			"body": "ok, the blog is here: https://loghomejourney.wordpress.com/. it's coming along slowly at this point- even though I'm \"dried in\" - I have the roof on, but no floors, and no chinking yet. I'm sanding/filling in some bee holes. Once complete, I will stain the logs. I need to add some porches, but we've literally had rain every other day since the New Year- I can't get anything done like pouring concrete for footers or whatnot. \n\nPrepping- yes, I'd love to DO more. I have TONS of ideas, and lots of know how - mechanical, electronics, old-timey stuff like pulleys and ropes (built the cabin with ropes and pulleys). Once I get the cabin finished, I have ideas on drinking water, gardening, tools I'd like to make (welding/woodworking). \n\nOne area I'd like to get into is turning 20 \"raspberry-pi\"-like devices (wifi enabled) into a private network for use in my neighborhood as an offgrid / grid-down surveillance and reporting system. Just have no idea how to set it up. barring that, I'd like to build a home surveillance system with trigger points and a silent alarm system. future plans....\n\nnot sure how to post pics.... does this work: \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/d0vgP92b/20190831-170949.jpg",
