After Qing dynasty's regime at around 17th century, Korea stopped to insist little China or something. Moreover, Qing's found father is a Korean with Korean Family name Kim. No one calls his/her own country \"little China\" or something nowadays. If someone does, he/she's gonna be bullied and laughed for his life long. (But there're some people who're insisting they're pro-Japanese in Korea. Yes, they're. Koreans failed to sweep off those pro-japanese group after independence from Japan Empire in 1945. \n\n>    the moral and behavior of Korean are usually similar to Chinese\n\nWe can say 'similar' if compared to China as well as Japan. \nBut modern China is not the one who inherited the historical China. Minds of modern Chinese people are totally different from Ming or Qing dynasty. The modern China is just a mutant intoxicated by communism. And its people are brainwashed and educated in a totally different way from those in Korea. \n.\nBefore emerging of Mao in China, we had so many things in common between China and Korea. We even fought together against Japan imperial Amy. (Yes, we always fought together against Japan even since 10C.) But after Mao ruined China, China has been just a monster. We can not say it has a culture or philosophy to share with. Everything in China nowadays are produced and spent by the communist government and for the communist government. All exist to preserve its communist government. It's just a huge zoo or factory. Just a monster.\n.\nChinese don't have a philosophy. They can't say or sing anything which is banned by the communist government. They just earn, eat, piss, have fun and sleep. And that's what the modern Chinese communist government wants for their people. A hu~~~ge animal zoo or prison.\n",
