But sadly one caster managed to finish the invocation, the floor started melting and a giant magma monster appeared, i managed to evade it and finish a 3-Dimensional magic formula, and i explode all the mana in front of me. The mages lost their balance so i give them a good beating before throwing them at the lava and making them sink into it.\n\nAfter finishing the monster, a earthquake happens and a giant magical influx happens, i run to the next run, but opening the door i noticed the room changed from a normal room to some kind of ruins. \nI see a giant cyclops girl, attacking the other students with tears, i tell the ogre teacher to get everyone and evacuate while i deal with the cyclops, i change my shielding to 3/4 physical and 1/4 magical, and with that i begin combat. Summoning a familiar to help me, i manage to weaken the giant really well, and her magic flux begins to become unstable. I plan to end that once and for all, but i stopped when she lost her will to fight.\nShe asks me to kill her, i get closer and notice two skeletons, remains of what she once called her children.\n\nShe was in the past a normal cyclops girl, exploring ruins with her team, but after a magical outburst during what we called 50 years ago \"The red Calamity\", she survived, but became stuck in that dimension we were right now. She did not know, but she was pregnant at the time, and her children were born, but they died of hunger. She was unable to die, as she did become a being of pure magic, with the dimension now in contact with the world once again, and our battle, she became vanishing from existence. I give a hug to her head, and she hugs the remains of her two children, and she vanishes into mana.\n\nAll that remains is her weapon, and a memento with a photo.\n\nI go to the next room were everyone that evacuated were waiting, we had a staircase and a misterious ruins to explore so we could find our way out, we decide to go ahead, and find our way into this.\n\n==================///==================\n\nThis is one of the dreams i had, i like this one :D\nIt's from 09/december/2020. Quite a nice one i would say, a little sad but still fun one to remember.\n\nSome dreams i'm a man, some i'm a girl, some i'm something??? I find it funny!\n\n\n",

			"body": "Dream time!\nI remembered a fun dream when i woke up, gonna post here:\n\nDream Date: 11/02/2021\n\nI was with a girl, friend of mine in that dream walking to our home, when a army of monsters appeared. We tried to run but in front of us a portal appeared and took us.\nWhen we woke up, we had turned into \"living weapons\", summons that could turn themselves into weapons, normally yielded by heroes.\n\nMy user was a nice guy, he wanted to save and protect the others, my friend user was my user sister, also a good person. Both of them were orphaned, so this was a good thing in their lives.\nAfter we were explained what happened,  e what we now are, we changed clothes for a more normal one to that world and we had a tour in the city, it was a big medieval town, with a lot of people. I ask them and they buy to me a small necklace with sphere with space to store something small, was a cute design and i loved it.\nAfter two days, me and my friend transformed (With our permission) into our weapon form, i was a double saber, purple/obsidian like, and she was a lance, quartz-like in color.\nWhen i transformed, my vision became my user vision, and we could talk via telepaty to help in combat.\n\nAfter two more days, i discover that i'm \"breaking\", a part of my body materialized into a crystal and was crumbling a part, and if it broke in its entirety, i could die.\nWe go to the cathedral for an important heroes meeting, and all heroes had legendary weapons, creatures or spirits summoned to help them. Not all of them were from other worlds, some were from that same world.\nI speak with one of the summoners i knew from when i appeared in that world, and he said that i had two options, one is to break my contract with my user, making him surrender being a hero, the other is another vessel (Accessory) for my user, that could store all my power. He opted for the second option, and i was allowed to choose any of them.\n\nAfter a small discussion with my user, i see a quick vision, one heroine and her weapon laughing, and me and my user being eaten by a monster that looked like a dinosaur in the temple.\nI store my stone in my necklace, and i walk up to the door, i see the small loli hero laughing (That bitch), i open the door and see the fucking t-rex coming. I shut the door closed with all my strenght, grab my user by the hand and we RUN from there. It was a 2 meters tall T-rex, not so big, but it still was a fucking monster.\nAfter we found one of his weaknesses (He could not jump easily), we started going around a small river/hole to get away. My user says everything would be alright, he turns me into a weapon, and together we defeat the monster (Using the hit and run tatics until it bleeds out).\n\nAfter that, my crystal was almost entirely broken, and i was getting weak. My weapon form was instable and my user ring was also crumbling apart. We go back to the temple and the summoner appears with a new accessory, a ring that could change form a little. I decide to connect with the ring, and my user does the same, i feel my power and my user powers conecting inside the ring, and my crystal stabilizes, becomes whole again and vanishes inside of me again. \nThe summoner asks for forgiveness, and we say that it was no problem now that it's resolved. \nWe go back to the temple after that to deal with the fucking heroine that tried to kill us aparently.\n",

My weapons were: A Energy Launcher, and a Semi-automatic Rifle. I was entering the building to kill the CEO of that company. I killed two guards that were guarding, after that, i entered the top of the building and could give a good shot on the CEO, he did not die.\nI grabbed him and jumped off the building to try and kill him (Using a grappling hook so i would not die), he hit the ground with all the force, and did not die.\nI had to run away and hide myself in a dormitory nearby, after all the old man CEO and his guards were trying to kill me with all their will.\n===//===\n\nSmall dream, but a adventure packed one~",

The king was fighthing with one of his heroes, and my \"hero\" was a skeleton monster like the boss from Sword Art Online (The Reaper).\nThe hero from the king was a tall woman, black hair, dark eyes and a beautiful body. She was fighting with a sword and a gun.\nI was above a platform watching (This arena fight was something normal for our two contries, as it decided some resources and even tournaments).\nWhen she finished my summon, i entered the arena (as we always do), and helped her as she was getting overwelmed by the enemies. She got angry and got off angry of the arena.\nThe king was confused, i got off the arena and got to her headquarters on the arena, i put my head to see if she was ok, she tossed a sword at me and said she was tired of this all, she knew me as the demon lord, as she was half demon half human. She was sad that i was being casual about the fight, and being gentle with her, i said it was alright and i was doing this for fun and not for glory.\nHer room had a magical window, that showed the starts in the space, even though we are underground, it was a beautiful view. I got closer and we talked a little, after some time she was excited and wanted something more. She liked me, i don't really remember why tho.\nWe kissed, her lips were warm, and her passionate hug and kisses in my mouth were very conforting.\nWhen we were going to the best part i was woken up.\n\nGood and classic, one of the two first dreams i ever wrote up in my diary.",
