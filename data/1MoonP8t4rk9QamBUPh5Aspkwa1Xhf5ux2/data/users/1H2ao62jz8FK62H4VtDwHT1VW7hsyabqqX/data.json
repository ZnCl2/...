I 've started writing a new blogging platform for ZeroNet.\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1JrT4VnMgpm6GgHV6R9yvgp5WkY8yTnRr7\n\nHere you can find version 0.2, which comes with an inner updater, so that all future versions can be installed through the admin panel.\n\nWould like some feedback.",

It is still in a primitive stage, so after insertion you will have to drag and drop it at the point of your document you want it to exist. The feature where it will be placed right where you type, will be implemented in a later version. Not the next one.\n\n\nIt also comes with some minor upgrades to the code which from now on will also be available on github. ZeroNet GitCenter will be next.\n\nhttps://github.com/cleancodetech/ZeroPress",

			"body": "Hello all.\n\nI made some further modifications to a blogging platform I try to write for ZeroNet on my free time:\n\nAdded an assets panel in the admin section, where users can manage their uploaded images. Using the interface, one can also find unused images, meaning images that are not used in some way either on posts or on the site in general and they can delete them.\nAlso the Social Menus were moved to their own panel and reddit is also made available.\nSome changes to the theme as well, trying to tackle the problem where an admin would create a new post but it would not appear on the front side.\nAlso added a viewport entry on the content.json file. Props to styromaniac@kxoid.bit\n\nYou can find it here: http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JrT4VnMgpm6GgHV6R9yvgp5WkY8yTnRr7\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated. Thank you for your time :)",

Some times ZeroNet take some time to update a zite even if there are seeders (haven't figured this one out yet).\n\nAnyway, thank you a lot for your feedback.",
