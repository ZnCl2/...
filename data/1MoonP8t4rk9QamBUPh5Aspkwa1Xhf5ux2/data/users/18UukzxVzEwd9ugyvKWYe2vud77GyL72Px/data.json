			"body": "Welcome to ZeroNet! Happy to see some more interest in P2P networks from others in the hentai community, it's a very thin silver lining to the fall of Sadpanda.\n\nI'm running two hentai manga focused ZeroGallery hubs: [Alotaplot](/1G8VWDQc5fXLkRiijJB4EZerDLmDVY75MZ/) and Anthology.jp, totalling ~450GB (i.e. nothing), and I'm adding more every week. Short term there is absolutely no way to do this for the Sadpanda's archives due to their size, but I think that would be ideal in the long run. I also run a [/h/entai](/19WTvkdL8rUnAqZNtg3XaPTiDsCAcc22eB/) board at Millchan Engine.",

The viewer is dealing well with 5000 galleries. The hub manager *was* getting slow with 2000, but @1pgallery updated it recently and it's doing great now for my use case. I'd bet it can handle 10x what I'm doing now (if it's linear), but that'd still only be 4TB. I think it's also more to do with the number of files than the size of them.\n\nThe upside of a hub system is that you could always split the collection over multiple hubs so it doesn't matter that much whether the hubs can handle 1TB or 100TB. The part I'm more worried about is how well the gallery viewer will handle search requests.\n\nThe biggest advantage of ZeroGalleries over simple torrents is that they can be previewed, partially downloaded, liked and commented on.\n\n> Millchan and Millchan Engine\nThey are both made by the same dev, but the Engine one has each board be it's own zite which means you only download the ones you want. Unfortunately they are not compatible so boards are often doubled.\n",
