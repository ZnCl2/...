One question, how much bitcoins satoshi nakamoto own inside the network?\nWhen will be full implemented, i mean all humans on earth will use only bitcoins, nakamoto will OWN this fucking world! So we exchange one tyran (banks) for another tyran! It is ok that!?\nIf youâ€™ve been wondering how many bitcoins Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, himself owns, you're not alone - a new research by the BitMEX exchange has attempted to answer exactly this question. Despite they recognize that their \"analysis is far from perfect\", the researchers estimate that Satoshi had mined up to 700,000 bitcoins in 2009, or less than previously estimated a million of coins.\n\nSource: https://cryptonews.com/news/how-many-bitcoins-does-satoshi-have-2487.htm\n\nFuck BITCOIN!",
