From ancient times to the modern age, the life of a human being has been nothing more than a frantic striving to be the criminal and not the victim. A vast majority of the people (I would say 99.99% of them) end up as the victimsâ€”there is no way of remedying the situation because the victims are mired in ignorance, cowardice, and malice, and are incapable of confronting the criminals.*",
