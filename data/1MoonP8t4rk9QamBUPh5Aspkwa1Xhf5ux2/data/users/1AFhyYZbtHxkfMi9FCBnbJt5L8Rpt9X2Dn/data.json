			"body": "Very accurate. The conversation about if social media have the right to ban Trump is separate from the conversation about if it is a good thing. \n\nBig tech currently still has if not a monopoly, a huge amount of control over attention. The arguments about how the right should build their own platforms contain a hint of truth: Centralizing the internet is and was a bad idea. We only have a shot at actual freedom of speech if there is no central authority that can be infiltrated, corrupted or taken out, otherwise we always have to rely on someone's good will.\n\nAs it is now, losing access to Twitter is in many ways political death. It is partly Trump's fault - he should have migrated to every platform possible as soon as possible, instead of propping Twitter up. Courts even prevented him from blocking people on there, because what he wants to say was deemed in the public interest, and now they went as far as deleting tweets from the official POTUS account.\n\nEra of force by word, information warfare - it does not matter what reality is, it matters how it is presented and who is able to present it. The latter is what big tech has control of, at least for now.",
