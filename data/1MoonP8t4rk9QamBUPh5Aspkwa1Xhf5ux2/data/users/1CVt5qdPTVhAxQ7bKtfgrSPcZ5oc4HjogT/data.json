Extract the tarball if it's the latter, then navigate to the extracted zerobundle folder. Then click zeronet, data, and then copy the location of the folder you're using or take note of it if copying is unavailable. When you use the git command what you want to do is replace /home/user/ZeroBundle/ZeroNet/data with the location of the data folder I had you write down in the previous step.",
