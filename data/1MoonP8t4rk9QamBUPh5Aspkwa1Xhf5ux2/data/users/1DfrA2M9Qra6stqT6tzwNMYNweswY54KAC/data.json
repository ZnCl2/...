A state level actor(think government) will have significant trouble finding out who you are, if you are on tor always mode and using zeronet through the Tor Browser Bundle.\nThat said, zeronet over tor is significantly less anonymous than i2p and a bit less then just using tor(reason for that being that correlation and sybil attacks are more effective on the tor network the more individual connections you make, since zeronet uses torrents this makes it less anonymous than tor alone). ZeroNet over i2p would be optimal, but since there is currently only one dev really working on this it could take a while for i2p to arrive.

I'll see when I have time to write something up, but I think I'll add some things there.\nAlternatively I could just recycle the explanations on PedoHub, do you think these are clear enough?\nText of that section:\n~\nHow does ZeroMe work?\nZeroMe is a merger zite. That means, that content storage and content display are separated.\nThe zite ZeroMe itself manages, how the content is displayed, while the hubs store the actual content you browse on ZeroMe.\nThere are two types of hubs. User registry hubs\nand User content hubs.\n~\nUser registry hubs:\nThese hubs are used for the New users and Suggested users sections on ZeroMe.\nOnly one of these does currently exists. It is the ZeroMe user registry and is hard coded into all (current) ZeroMe implementations.\nThe content.json of that hub only allows the providers ZeroID and ZeroVerse.\nThat has the effect, that if you register with neither of them, your account will not show up in those sections.\nDepending on your situation, this could be desirable or undesirable, since all registered users will show up in both sections will show everyone that uses ZeroMe.\n~\nUser content hubs:\nThese are where your profile, posts, comments and replies are stored.\nThere are many hubs out there(this hub being one of them). A list of most of them can be found on Get All Hub.\nEvery post you make will be stored on the hub, that you registered on. If you comment on a post, that is not stored on your hub, than your content is stored twice, once on the hub you're on and once on the hub of the user you wrote a comment to. Since all content is stored on hubs, you can only see posts from hubs you already visited(downloaded) once before.\nIn other words: The more hubs you have, the more posts you're able to see (the posts in the Everyone section of ZeroMe).\nEven though ZeroMe does not have an moderation system, hub owners(this can be either hub runners or anyone that has the private key of the hub) have absolute power over that hub. If they so chose to, they are able to delete posts, users and the hub itself(by turning the entire hub into an blank page, for example), however they cannot meaningfully edit user data and deleting posts/users requires work, that is likely to be noticed, by more tech savvy people and everyone, that happened to be also using that hub at that time.",

However,\n>With the option tor always all tracker are forced to use the Tor network, so nobody can see your real IP.\n\nThis is not what it does. `--tor always` only uses tor to communicate with other peers. This is done using an .onion address instead of an ip address peers that offer their ip are(to the best of my knowledge) ignored by any client, that runs in tor only mode. Connections to all tracker are **still** made over a normal internet connection. The option to disable that as well is `--trackers_proxy tor`. A proper tor only setup can be archived by using this config file:\n```\n[global]\ntor = always\ntrackers_proxy = tor\nforce_encryption\ndisable_udp\n```\nTor is can only communicate over tcp, so udp is worthless in tor always mode. For convenience, you can also add `open_browser = False` in the config or use `--open_browser False` option.\nThere is some more detail in my '[How to install Zeronet on QubesOS](/1PexoLogqCsGAwYEUNqKnmzccg1r5tzCZ3/?Post:5:How+to+install+Zeronet+on+QubesOS)' post on my Blog.\n\nI haven't heard of weku before, but everything about it just screams steemit to me.

			"body": "Yes there is.\n\nThere is the option to mute users and zites, that you don't like(or legally can view where you live). Build on top of that are blocklists, zites that contain users and zites someone else put on there. If enabled, your ZeroNet client will automatically treat every user and zite on that list as if you've muted them.\nThis all is local(on your computer), for global(on everyones computer) bans, there isn't really anything there. The owner of a zite can choose to implement moderating features or moderate himself(because zite owners=gods). However most zites do not remove content even if they have a moderation system, but rather hide it by default(in case of millchan) and a zite owner actually moderating the public content is rare, which has many reasons, but the most common one is that when moderation stops and censorship starts is something subjective, so most owners just don't moderate at all.\n\nOn here, for example, the only time(to my knowlage) something was actually removed(banned), was when someone posted childporn. Nofish stepped in and deleted it on the hubs he owned(most of the color ones), however the ones that where not on his hubs are actually still there, because the owner of that hub has left zeronet some time ago.",
