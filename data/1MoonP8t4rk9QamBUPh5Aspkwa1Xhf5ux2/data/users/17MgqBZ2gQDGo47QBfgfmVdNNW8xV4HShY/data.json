			"body": "Fascists propagate conspiracy theories such as the pandemic not existing because they want to keep social darwinism (except for them) going on further. They want further extermination of poor and disadvantaged people while they have their private healthcare in luxuries and others die. And they don't want their businesses to be hurt in profits, they prefer people working to death with diseases instead of paying more taxes or losing some profits. Profit stolen from workers all said (surplus value).\n\nThis is why they keep propagating the conspiracy theories, with the worst intention, to keep the capitalist system, and why they try to present themselves as saviours to get support. Solution: armed expropriation of the bourgeoisie and establishment of a planned economy with no capitalists, like the USSR. For an improved contemporary proposal see... 'Towards a New Socialism' by Paul Cockshott.",
