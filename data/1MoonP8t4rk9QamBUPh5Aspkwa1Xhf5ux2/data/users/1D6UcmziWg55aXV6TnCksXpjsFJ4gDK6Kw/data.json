With some people there's lot of conspiracy theory talk and weird behaviors like the aversion to certain words.

I think truly being against terrorism should extend to terror in all its forms, including that orchestrated by the US military and CIA. \n\nFor those not too familiar with the history of US foreign policy, here's a map of US Military and CIA interventions since WW2.

A people are almost always better off solving their own nation's problems, but this is very difficult in a military dictatorship.

Your analysis of the middle east is a bit nuanced. In the 1960's, Afghanistan for instance was one of the most progressive liberal democracies in the world (long after the founding of Israel). The Soviet and American led interventions in the area after a failed revolution sparked a reaction that ripples to this day. They used to joke about making women cover themselves, then they did. The state of Israel had nothing to do with this. I am opposed to the occupation of Palestine, but I strongly sense your opposition to the excesses of the state of Israel stem not from concern for the oppression of the Palestinians, but from antisemitism and race hatred. The ((())) brackets denote antisemitism, but I am sure you already know this. Regardless, such fascistic symbolism is deplorable. In Rojava the Kurdish people are building a stateless democracy in the Middle East and it is actually working quite well.",

			"body": "@Kiloromeu: I just find it ironic how ignorant most people are in regards to what 'Marxism' even is. Marxian political economy and Marxian economics are merely a critical, yet extremely thorough scientific analysis of the capitalist system. From Marx's critique of capitalism, countless schools of economic and political thought have come about, all attributing themselves in one form or another to the ideas of Karl Marx. From the most anti-authoritarian variants of anarchism to the most totalitarian, anti-liberty forms of Stalinism-- all of which claim to be attempting to address the very real ills and undemocracy of capitalist society. \n\nLet me give you some context.\n\nThere are today published, 50 volumes containing pretty much the entire economic and sociopolitical writings of Marx and Engels, each volume is about 500 pages each. Do you know how much of that speculates as to what a socialist or communist society would look like? About 7 pages, and even those 7 pages appear radically democratic in scope. Did Marx draft a \"master plan\" for the construction of a liberated society? No. He speculated, but his go-to phrase was \"I do not have a crystal ball\". Marx always said, \"If you want to know the future, go to the local fair and pay a fortune teller\". \n\nDo you want to see his appraisal of his \"ideal\" social revolt in embryo? It happened during his life time. Read his writings on The Paris Commune, which he praised for arming the common working people, abolishing the police as a political institution, making all public servants democratically elected on the basis of universal suffrage and instantly recallable by popular petition-- receiving no more than a workman's wage. He praised the commune for taking state power only to begin the process of the destruction of the state. Every elected official had an extremely short term of service. His \"ideal\" social revolt is today praised by many anarchists, and Marx criticized the neo-Jaconins who wanted to re-create the reign of terror of the first French Revolution. Is it revolution that offends you? This tradition was continued under Rosa Luxemburg, who critically supported the Russian Revolution, the worlds first workers and peasant revolution of the poor and oppressed who at the same time, fervently condemned the dictatorial methods of the Bolsheviks in the name of Marxism. She said,\n\n\"On the other hand, it is a well-known and indisputable fact that without a free and untrammeled press, without the unlimited right of association and assemblage, the rule of the broad masses of the people is entirely unthinkable…\n\nFreedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of one party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently. Not because of any fanatical concept of “justice” but because all that is instructive, wholesome and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effectiveness vanishes when “freedom” becomes a special privilege...\n\nWhen all this is eliminated, what really remains? In place of the representative bodies created by general, popular elections, Lenin and Trotsky have laid down the soviets as the only true representation of political life in the land as a whole, life in the soviets must also become more and more crippled. Without general elections, without unrestricted freedom of press and assembly, without a free struggle of opinion, life dies out in every public institution, becomes a mere semblance of life, in which only the bureaucracy remains as the active element. Public life gradually falls asleep, a few dozen party leaders of inexhaustible energy and boundless experience direct and rule. Among them, in reality only a dozen outstanding heads do the leading and an elite of the working class is invited from time to time to meetings where they are to applaud the speeches of the leaders, and to approve proposed resolutions unanimously – at bottom, then, a clique affair – a dictatorship, to be sure, not the dictatorship of the proletariat but only the dictatorship of a handful of politicians, that is a dictatorship in the bourgeois sense, in the sense of the rule of the Jacobins (the postponement of the Soviet Congress from three-month periods to six-month periods!) Yes, we can go even further: such conditions must inevitably cause a brutalization of public life: attempted assassinations, shooting of hostages, etc. (Lenin’s speech on discipline and corruption.)”\n\nKeep in mind here that Rosa Luxemburg, a “Libertarian Marxist” by today’s standards, was in fact, in her time, nothing more than an Orthodox Marxist. Her writings if read today, would be seen as radically libertarian by modern American standards, yet they were Marxist through and through. Our fight is for democracy at work, and for local democracy. We want to bring power to the streets where the people live, to towns and communities, popular assemblies against centralized state power. We want an armed people, ready at every moment to defend their liberty from all external threats. We want to expand the liberty that exists today, adding positive liberty to negative liberty. We desire not \"free markets\" but free, emancipated labor, a free association of producers. Yes, we desire communism, free, stateless communism.\n\nIf you read my ZeroSite you would see that we have an entire page dedicated to this topic (http://127.0.0.1:43110/1CoVgJCDb588bVtxU9VAwGLGuybzdr3mfg/libmarx.html)\n\nWhat do you associate with the word \"Marxism\"? My guess is not at all what we are talking about. Some form of Stalinism, that in modern political discourse is equated with the ideas of Karl Marx? They do not teach such things in schools for a reason. What more can I say? Ignorance wins yet again.",

			"body": "@Quantumworld:  \"heard those claims allot. Communism looks good on paper but when practiced it fails totally do to non equal compensation to the amount of work being done.\"\n\nAh yes, the \"works on paper\" argument. Where exactly has communism been practiced? The early Apostles? Or do you mean the totalitarian one-party states of the 20th century which only claimed to have achieved socialism (really more state capitalism), and in those countries the official motto was \"He who shall not work, neither shell he eat\" or \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their work\" which is the motto of socialism as differentiated from capitalism where the propertied classes can amass great fortunes without working themselves. So basically the argument for socialism is precisely that of equal pay for equal work, and communism of social goods to each according to their need (implying a post-scarcity society likely utilizing automation, i.e. where we are heading).\n\n\"Basically everyone get the same pay regardless what you do. So there is no incentive to do jobs that many people do not want to do because it is the same pay.\"\n\nPretty much no one thinks this, most thinkers speculate that those who do said jobs would be given first access to luxuries. We are after all, talking about a post scarcity society. If you mean to say that Stalinism is the same as \"Communism\", even in those societies pay was more egalitarian but a Doctor still made substantially more than a Janitor, as per the philosophy of socialism.\n\n\"Then you have the group think mentality. Where one Jerk in the group can just jam up everyone else in the group from doing anything because they need a 100% majority vote. Meaning that nothing ever gets done.\"\n\nWhere exactly did you here that? I no of no such communist philosophy, even a Stalinist one that insists on a 100% majority vote, this is quite an absurd claim. Industrial democracy can take a variety of different forms, including the election of those who manage an enterprise on a higher level. Political democracy? Is that what you are arguing against? I am unsure what you are referring to. As for nothing getting done, we are talking about local, direct democracy. Even the Stalinist countries which lacked that, (what I you seem to be referring to as communism) were known for ruthless efficiency (i.e. the philosophy of dragging a country industrially into the 20th century from semi-feudal barbarism kicking and screaming). Later stagnation of course being due chiefly to a near total lack of democratic methods of industrial management. \n\n\"I have read just about every communist book that is in English made.\"\n\nI somehow doubt that, I don't know of anyone who can boast such a thing.\n\n\"When communism is practiced, corruption, theft, and out right lying between communist members becomes a normal practice and it eventually destroys the state.\"\n\nWell the word 'Communism' implies a stateless society, something you would certainly know if you were as knowledgeable on the subject as you claim to be, with all due respect. If you are referring to the 20th century Stalinist states, even to the early democratic aspirations of the Russian Revolution, what can you expect from an extremely impoverished country? Name for me a single poor country today that is not rifled with corruption. What do you mean by communist members? Parties? You do know that even many Marxists are against the use of political parties right? Once again there has never been a \"communist country\", it's an oxymoron. Stalinist? Yes. But communist? No. Totalitarianism in political life and state-capitalism in economic life is about the farthest thing from socialism or communism you can have.\n\n\"Now is capitalism perfect? Absolutely not. And the U.S. has not been a capitalist country since 1913. The U.S. is run by crony capitalism currently.\"\n\nYou should know that the definition of capitalism is \"private ownership of the means of production\" in an industrialized society. You hear this argument from right-wing libertarians a lot. We know that the economic growth and stability of \"fully free markets\" is naught. If you look at the most successful forms of capitalism in the world, look to China. That is our future under capitalism. The thing I hate about \"libertarian\" free market fundamentalism is that it often takes a Stalinist attitude towards its own failures. When the devastating effects of its own policies are revealed, the right libertarian, like the Stalinist, demands only a more complete adherence to their ideas.\n\n\"A private bank controls the U.S. economy. The state gave up its right to make money, and turned it over to a hidden private banking cartel that is a fascist predatory lender. Its called the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nCapitalist banks are evil? Who knew? There are a lot of conspiracies about this kind of thing out there you know. Be careful with that.\n\n\"Unless you have some new philosophy that fixes Communism it will fail every time.\" \n\nLol\n\n\"No country is capitalist at this time in my view.\"\n\nWe are using the Marxian term, also the term used in Keynesian and Neoclassical schools of economic thought (all pretty widely accepted in one form or another) and not some esoteric Austrian school that hardly any economist takes seriously.\n\n\"I cannot say and will not say how high up I was in the Communist party. When you leave the party they try to kill you. That's just a fact about Communism. It is a brutal system of slavery.\"\n\nOnce again, lol. What country do you even live in? You speak English so I am assuming America or one of the Five Eyes nations. Which Communist Party? I know plenty of people who enter and leave this or that party at a whim as their views change. A murder? That would make headlines! Once again we are anti-Stalinist, anti-authoritarians. A free association of producers in a stateless society based on political and industrial democracy and unlimited individual liberty is slavery? But work for a propertied class for poverty wages or starve is not? Lol.",

Would state ownership be better with a more genuine democracy? A socialist democracy? Maybe, but I would prefer not to, especially in regards to the US government.\n\nMarxian economist Richard Wolff proposes Workers Self-Directed Enterprises (WSDE's) in his book \"Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism\". I think this is a good starting point. Board members and the people who run the company would be democratically elected by the workers themselves, instantly recallable at all times and responsible to the people, and perhaps for a big company with representation to the general public. That would also mean that such representatives would likely not be paid much more than the average worker, who is going to elect someone who wants to give themselves a million dollar salary?\n\nAs to the specific forms such a thing would take? I would say you can certainly decree that private ownership be abolished, but what to come in its place? I can say yes, democracy, but as to specifics that lies in the mists of the future. Ultimately the forms such a thing would take would have to be up to the people themselves to figure out on their own.

I see market socialism at the very least as a necessary evil, perhaps a catalyst for something grander? Only time will tell. ",

You can kill a frog by boiling him slowly in a pot of water, but plunge the from into boiling hot water and he will leap out immediately! Maybe we are like the frog here, perhaps this is more terrifying than merely turning the key to tyranny. If congress openly passed NSA spying legislation the people would have made a revolution! But because they did it in secret, how did the people react when they found out \"oh they have been doing it all along, big deal\"? It's a sad state of affairs.",

It is sort of like arguing about the inner mechanics of Keynesian economics by saying \"Canesian economics\". Or talking about the specific, technical aspects of how Tor works by saying \"TOR\" instead of \"Tor\". It's just a major red flag that says \"You haven't REALLY investigated this objectively for yourself, familiarizing yourself with both sides of the argument\". I mean no offense, I appreciate the feedback, positive or negative, more encouragement to do the research for yourself (I probably would have argued the same thing when I was much younger, and you yourself may come to the opposite conclusions as I did and that's okay too). \n\nAnd also, what is meant by communism? You seem to imply that Stalin's USSR was a communist society, not even Stalin made such claims. If you read Stalin's own constitution it defines the USSR as socialist embodying the philosophy of \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their work\" (i.e. not everyone is paid the same, as was never claimed by any regime). As for \"only works with a dictator with a gun\", one can look at anarcho-communist Spain or Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring. Also \"the same low wages\" is an interesting argument since communists regard capitalism as a necessary stepping stone in order to usher in a post-scarcity era where it is even conceivable to speak of abolishing wage labor (not the \"same\" wages) and having a society productive enough for all to give according to their ability and take according to their needs (i.e. communism).",

			"body": "@Petrina: Thanks for the question! I assume you mean updating the mirrors so I will answer that (correct me if I am wrong). \n\nIt's actually somewhat of a process when I make a post. I usually publish first on redliberty.org using a WordPress Whonix VM (Tor). Then I preview the post and copy the relevant aspects of the page source to paste it into the index.html file in my Freenet VM and I insert it into Freenet. Then I copy the index.html file into my ZeroNet VM where I then sign and publish the site to update it. Then I put that index.html onto a flash drive and physically pop it into my I2P server where I use VNC to copy the index.html file into the docroot of my redliberty.i2p eepsite. Then I pop the flash drive into my Tor server and repeat the process on there. I also update my Sone on Freenet and my ZeroMe (where you are) alerting the world to the new post.\n\nUsually this takes me about 30 minutes to an hour for each post. It's actually quite frustrating at times and sometimes I get annoyed but ultimately I think it's for the greater good and that's what keeps making me do it over and over again every time I publish a post. I mean, I'm adding good content to censorship resistant networks and meeting cool people at the same time so why not? Is anyone afraid of ending up on a list for visiting a socialist blog? Not on Tor/I2P/Freenet/ZeroNet they aren't! Not to mention the fact that some people in authoritarian/unstable countries might actually benefit from being able to read my writings here. In the future I plan to simplify/ automate this whole process but for now I gotta do what I gotta do. It's a lot of virtual machines, flash drives, and VNC connections but whatever gets the job done right?",

Before Obama it was largely condemned by the democrats (even if legislation such as the infamous Patriot Act enjoyed bi-partisan support). After Obama it became largely bi-partisan. Post-Snowden the veil was lifted off of many people's eyes. Obama wasn't about change at all. Today you have anti-establishment democrats (yes such as Sanders and AOC) in addition to anti-establishment conservatives (right-wing libertarians such as Ron Paul) standing against it, but other than that it has become mainstream. \n\nIt's an interesting united front on the issue with leftists such as myself (mostly of the anti-authoritarian variety) and right-wing libertarians. It's an explicitly up-down rather than a left-right politics on this issue. I would say Pelosi and Trump are just about in agreement on the issue, AOC or Sanders and Trump not so much. But I don't think they hold the views we do, at least to the extent that we do either. I think much of the contemporary left though is often (though not always) as idiotic on the issue of political censorship as Trump, and as if not more idiotic on privacy when they aren't the ones needing it. I am proud to say that Red Liberty stands apart in that regard (see my post condemning the corporate censorship of Alex Jones as but one example and numerous posts in defense of the necessity of the cypherpuks movement, privacy, censorship resistant networks, etc). Often it's a \"it's bad when they do it, good when we do it\". It's a totally insane notion.",
