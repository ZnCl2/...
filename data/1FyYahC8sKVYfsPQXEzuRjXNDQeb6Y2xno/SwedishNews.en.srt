1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,900
,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,540
1: 1 captioning. Live passages may contain errors.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,300
Good evening, welcome to "10vor10".

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,340
Terror comes back in Spain.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,180
What triggers the attack in Spain.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,460
Why the breakdown in Germany

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,980
Is not the only construction site on the central route.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,140
The background to taking over the free local newspapers.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,580
And in our focus: Blockchain, a technology,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,780
Which could fundamentally alter our world, just like the World Wide Web.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,780
Not again. To Nice, Paris, London, Berlin

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,820
It is now in the middle of the Barcelona holiday season.

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,620
And the Ramblas, the pedestrian mile, where every tourist walks along,

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,820
Where people sit in cafes, drink aperitif.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,460
In the late afternoon, terrorists have attacked.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,620
A truck rushes into a crowd.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,820
So far there are at least 12 dead and dozens of injured.

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,340
It is right in the heart of the popular Las Ramblas shopping district.

19
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,020
A white van rushes into a crowd,

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,660
Runs snake lines, tears passers-by with him,

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,660
Leaves dead and injured.

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,460
The driver fled on foot, leaving the white van behind.

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,380
 First I've heard a lot of people  screaming.

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,140
 Then I saw the van  across the boulevard.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,020
 Everywhere people were  on the floor.

26
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,140
 It was cruel.  A terrible image.

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,820
The emergency services evacuate shops and houses

28
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,940
Around the place of the attack.

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Metro stations are closed.

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,340
An array of antiterror forces comes from home at home.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,860
Later the Catalan authorities confirmed:

32
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,660
Two suspects are caught.

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,540
A stop in the heart of the tourist city of Barcelona -

34
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,660
Quite unexpectedly,

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,100
Says our South-East Europe correspondent Erwin Schmid.

36
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,940
 The Spanish authorities were late.  testen since the attack in Nice

37
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,180
 in high alertness.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,220
 I personally had the impression that  that too the police presence

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,380
 at neuralgic points,  just like the Ramblas,

40
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,220
 where many tourists are staying, .

41
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,620
 There were also concrete threats  this spring

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,620
 from the Islamic state,  but also from El Qaeda in the Maghreb,

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,220
 that Spain could get into the crossroads  the terrorists.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,380
 This also shows the fact that in  Spain within the last year

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,420
 almost 200 presumed islamist  terrorists were arrested.

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,580
 So yes, you were in Spain  in high alertness.

47
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,700
The IS-Terrormiliz has on the Internet

48
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
The terrorist attack in Barcelona.

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,100
One of the soldiers of the so-called Islamic state

50
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,860
Had carried out the act, it was said.

51
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:28,020
We are now switching to Barcelona, ​​the free journalist Julietmacher.

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,420
Can you hear me?

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,020
 Hello?

54
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,860
Good evening, Fraumacher.

55
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,940
Now it works.

56
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,980
They are near the crime scene.

57
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,340
What is the situation like?

58
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,380
 Good evening.

59
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,580
 The location is still not  defused.

60
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,020
 I was still at a  other place, near the

61
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,220
 Ramblas.

62
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,260
 There were also all streets  blocked. The whole Ramblas are

63
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,340
 locked.

64
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,260
 People have to make big detours .

65
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,740
 On the other side of the Ramblas,  here, everything is still locked.

66
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,740
 You can see again and again  Polizeiautos and hospitals.

67
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,220
 The location is tense.

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,060
 People are also very  resolved and affected.

69
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,940
 Today I spoke to people , which are directly seen

70
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,980
,

71
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,620
 neither vice zigzag over the  Ramblas before.

72
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,060
 I've talked to people who saw  injured and dead.

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,340
 Nurses who were trying to take care of the people .

74
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,460
The police informed very hesitantly.

75
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,060
Why this restraint?

76
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,340
 I think the reason for the  restraint is,

77
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,500
 that you did not want to spread panic .

78
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,820
 The police spoke quite a long time  only from a dead.

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,980
 However, after seeing various  eyewitnesses,

80
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,140
 that there were guaranteed several dead .

81
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,580
 One spoke of three presumed  offenders.

82
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,300
 The police, who told me  Colleagues, had the perpetrators

83
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,300
 intermittently out of sight  lost.

84
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,460
 One has been reluctant to let any panic arise.

85
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,500
 It is holiday season.

86
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,180
 The city is full and especially  the Ramblas meaningful.

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,300
 There is day and night a come and go .

88
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,380
 There was also panic to prevent .

89
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,180
There is much speculation about the perpetrators.

90
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,820
What is it about it?

91
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,540
 As the information comes also  very sparse.

92
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,620
 30 minutes ago has the Catalan  Minister President

93
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,820
 given a press conference.

94
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,900
 There was two of the  speech.

95
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,740
 Newspapers write, however, one of the  offenders is on the run

96
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,380
 in the gun exchange with the police  killed.

97
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,420
 One of the perpetrators was arrested.

98
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,620
 The other is not  if it is the third offender

99
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,100
 or the one who was shot  -

100
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,140
 is from Morocco.

101
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,700
 He has lived in the province of Girona  relax.

102
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,460
About the events in Barcelona we keep you on the internet

103
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,340
Under srf.ch/news and in the "Tagesschau Nacht".

104
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,940
To our focus:

105
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,060
A currency, which is only virtual,

106
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,980
A currency without coins and notes,

107
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,860
With which one can do everything: shopping, acting, speculating.

108
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,740
This sounds abstract to many, but is increasingly reality.

109
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,860
Digital currencies boom,

110
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,380
Most notably the most famous among them, the Bitcoin.

111
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,500
So has become the price of a bitcoin in recent years

112
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,700
From a few francs to more than 4,000 francs.

113
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,140
So there is goldgrass tuning around the crypt.

114
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,180
The city of Zug also wants to make a contribution

115
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,820
And is now recommended as Crypto Valley.

116
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,260
To the hype about Bitcoin - Marcel Niedermann.

117
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,180
Even the traders are amazed:

118
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,900
At one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in Switzerland in Zug

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,300
The staff have all hands full.

120
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,940
 Obviously, we are in the middle of  a market that tends upward,

121
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,460
 where prices are rising.

122
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,500
 In the last two weeks  the Bitcoin course has risen rapidly,

123
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,420
 from 2'500 to over $ 4,000.

124
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,300
Two years ago these brokers acted

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,780
Bitcoins in the volume of $ 20 million a year.

126
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
Today are also sometimes times individual orders

127
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,140
Of over $ 100 million.

128
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Cryptry is a goldgrass mood.

129
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,460
The city of Zug also wants to participate in the boom:

130
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,660
She wants to be a Crypto Valley,

131
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,220
A center for blockchain technology.

132
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,780
This also interests Federal Councilor Johann Schneider-Ammann.

133
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,700
He sees potential in the cryptic diet.

134
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,700
 I'm assuming  that it's more than a hype.

135
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,700
 I think it is a development,  which will be sustainable.

136
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:49,380
 This new instrument, this  new model,

137
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,420
 this networking  and linking model has future.

138
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,620
For transactions with conventional currencies

139
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,260
A bank is always connected.

140
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,620
This is different for cryptics like Bitcoin.

141
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,700
Here, money is directly and encrypted

142
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,300
Between two persons.

143
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,860
Thus, the crypt diet is not subject to any control by central banks.

144
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,460
So that the transfer is nevertheless safe,

145
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,860
Each transaction is logged in a type of register.

146
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,900
This register stores simultaneously on thousands of computers worldwide.

147
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,260
They communicate with each other continuously

148
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,940
And thus control each other.

149
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,060
Bitcoins are similar to gold in their total quantity limited.

150
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,220
If demand increases,

151
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,140
This affects the course of the virtual currency.

152
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,940
And this demand is now greater than ever.

153
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,500
 There are both companies  and institutions as well as private.

154
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,420
 People used to buy  from the technology scene

155
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,420
 small amounts of bitcoin.

156
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,340
 Today, banks  and asset managers are entering.

157
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,180
 And va  also very well-off people,

158
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,060
 which was not the case before.

159
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,420
A private bank in Zurich has been offering equipment in Bitcoin since July.

160
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,300
It had been overrun by inquiries,

161
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,620
Says the responsible manager.

162
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,340
Particularly very wealthy customers, who invest their money broadly,

163
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,340
Showed great interest.

164
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
 The price,  the course of the Bitcoin

165
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,260
 and its nature, the digital,  the cryptobased approaches,

166
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,420
 do not correlate  with other investment forms

167
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,380
 and can thus contribute to the famous  diversification effect.

168
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,660
Bitcoin as a speculative currency and an alternative to known systems.

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,700
Meanwhile, other banks have cryptos.

170
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,460
However, not only speculators have interest in Bitcoin.

171
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,340
Venezuela: Bitcoin has been particularly in demand this past week.

172
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,060
One reason is probably the strong money depreciation

173
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,780
The domestic currency Bolivar.

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,340
Bitcoin is also strongly traded in China.

175
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,980
There is limited trade in foreign exchange,

176
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,740
Capital movements are controlled by the government.

177
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,060
With the crypt diet, people can circumvent the controls.

178
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,580
Be it as an escape from state interference

179
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,020
Or to bet on price gains.

180
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,620
Va speculation drives the price up.

181
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,540
This entails high risks.

182
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,540
 If there is much speculation,  when the journey goes down,

183
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,980
 it is not possible to exclude,

184
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,020
 certain investors are again saying goodbye to this topic.

185
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,460
 Then the value of  drops again quickly.

186
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,580
Bitcoin is no longer only playwright

187
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,740
From a few technology affiliates.

188
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,380
Beneficiaries who bet on the crypt diet,

189
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,340
Continue the myth of Bitcoin - until further notice.

190
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,060
Anyone who invented Bitcoin has not been clarified to date.

191
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,020
Clearly, however, is: Dieselbe mysterious figure

192
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,220
Has also developed the related technology.

193
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,700
A technology that could revolutionize the world.

194
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,660
Jean Francois Tanda.

195
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,340
Blockchain is the technology,

196
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,940
On which the digital currency Bitcoin runs.

197
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,260
While the future of Bitcoin is uncertain, it is safe to say:

198
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,660
The technology behind the decentralized database will survive.

199
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,300
This is the special thing about the Blockchain:

200
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,700
It saves all past transactions forever in blocks,

201
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,980
Which are lined up in a chain

202
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,460
And are no longer changeable.

203
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,980
This chain of blocks is stored on countless computers,

204
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,100
Which are constantly synchronized and contain the same information.

205
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,340
Unlike central databases

206
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,380
No one can change the content unilaterally,

207
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,460
Since the computers involved would hit the alarm,

208
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,060
To ward off such an attack.

209
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,580
A blockchain application is already available as insurance -

210
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,620
If flights are canceled or delayed.

211
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,060
This is followed by Etherisc from ETH graduate Stephan Karpischek.

212
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,700
His start-up will soon be moving into the Crypto Valley.

213
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,660
On the application you enter flight number, flight date,

214
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,220
Concludes a policy and pays for the crypt diet Ether.

215
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,900
If there is a delay,

216
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,220
A lump sum will be paid out automatically.

217
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,460
But Stephan Karpischek wants even more:

218
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,700
He wants to use the blockchain to mix the insurance market.

219
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,060
 The insurance company  must make a profit.

220
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,420
 It must generate profit.

221
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,980
 A blockchain based  insurance

222
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,980
 does not have to make any profit.

223
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,740
 And the conditions under which  pays the insurance,

224
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,860
 are fixed.

225
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,740
 They are poured into software  and are no longer editable.

226
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,700
 Anyone can review these  conditions, check

227
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,180
 and the insurance  proves provably in the event of damage.

228
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,220
And who finances this?

229
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,260
 Finance  the other participants.

230
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,060
 That's what we know today as  Peer-to-Peer Insurance

231
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,860
 and most likely  with a cooperative model.

232
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,220
Another example, which does not yet exist in practice,

233
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,900
But many come to see is car leasing,

234
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,660
Which could be fully automated with Blockchain in the future.

235
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,300
The driver pays his leasing fee on a blockchain.

236
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,820
This communicates with the car

237
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,060
And confirms the payment receipt.

238
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,660
The car can be started.

239
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,900
Device of the driver with his payment in arrears,

240
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,340
The blockchain signals this to the car. The car is blocked.

241
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,140
Only when the due money has arrived,

242
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,020
The driver can drive away again.

243
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,340
Daniel Diemers is a programmer and strategy consultant.

244
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,300
He has been dealing with Blockchain for years.

245
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,020
Technology is going to be more and more popular, he says.

246
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,140
 A good example: You always  from land registry offices.

247
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,140
 In Georgia  is today a blockchain live,

248
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,300
 on the the entire  public hand, the governments

249
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,380
 register your transactions.

250
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,700
 There are other examples  in the area art -

251
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,860
 you can register artworks fake-  cher on the blockhain.

252
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,460
 This will also be the really span-  application possibilities.

253
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,540
 Whenever I want to check in a  tab,

254
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,380
 that something  can not be falsified,

255
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,260
 will find blockchain  big spread.

256
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,300
Such a register application already exists today for diamonds.

257
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,260
For proof of origin and for combating blood diamonds.

258
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,580
The company Everledger records the precious stones

259
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,500
And gives them a digital DNA.

260
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,820
One million diamonds are already registered on a blockchain.

261
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,180
Thus, origin and authenticity of the diamonds

262
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,900
At any time.

263
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,020
Algorithms of blockchain replace faulty people,

264
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,860
But today we are only at the beginning.

265
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,580
 mid-nineties  was web technology

266
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,460
 also for many a book  with seven seals, very difficult.

267
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,700
 In the phase  we are now using blockchain.

268
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,620
The blockchain, it seems, will not replace all the previous ones,

269
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,900
But change a lot.

270
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,940
It could be according to the World Wide Web

271
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,980
The next revolution with great effect.

272
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,940
There are only some twisted tracks,

273
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,980
But the rich to the railway traffic on the main route at all,

274
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,340
The North-South axis.

275
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,940
Va the freight traffic suffers from the collapse of the line at Karlsruhe,

276
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,380
Caused by tunneling.

277
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,500
The break is certainly not

278
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,180
The only construction site on the alpine transversal

279
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,940
And quasi the icing on the many problems,

280
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,940
Which always show up when the route is extended. Christian Rensch.

281
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,740
Here the transport containers,

282
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,540
At the loading station Rothrist.

283
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,620
360 containers are up to date, three times more than usual.

284
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,580
This is because the transport via the rail is blocked,

285
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,660
Carrier Ulrich Giezendanner

286
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,820
The lock in the far Rastatt clearly shows:

287
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,340
 The location is much more dramatic,  than you think.

288
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,860
 Now she tapers.

289
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,740
 We still had goods  that was stored in the containers.

290
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,420
 Now it's getting better:  There are bottlenecks,

291
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,140
 and that will intensify in the next  three, four days massively.

292
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,940
The logistics company Giezendanner

293
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Drives 70% of its goods on the rail.

294
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,260
But by the full lock in Germany

295
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,540
The Swiss rail freight transport is also stuttering.

296
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,140
Concern also with the competent Federal Office of Transport.

297
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,820
 It is  a serious situation.

298
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,900
 The situation is at the moment  not dramatic,

299
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,140
 but the longer  the goods stow,

300
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,940
 the greater the impact.

301
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,140
 This will mainly affect the  producing industry,

302
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,420
 which depends on regular deliveries .

303
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,060
 If the goods can not be delivered on a  other way,

304
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,700
 be that about alternative railroads  or with load weighing,

305
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,740
 some companies could  get in trouble.

306
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,660
The bent tracks of Rastatt.

307
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,180
An image that is unworthy of a high-speed train.

308
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,340
Germany's leading striker in North-South rail freight traffic

309
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,220
Is interrupted.

310
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,020
Instead of 200 freight trains daily there is nothing here for days.

311
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,180
Debt is a new tunnel under the track bed.

312
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,460
Today the tunnel was begun to be filled with concrete.

313
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,260
Whether the 18 million expensive tunnel boring machine can still be saved,

314
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,500
Is uncertain.

315
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,220
But disabilities of the north-south axis are not only present in Rastatt.

316
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,180
Construction sites and bottlenecks

317
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,140
Are on the agenda for alpine freight transport.

318
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,500
In Germany, the entire Rhine valley railway is currently under construction

319
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,820
On four tracks. But it also hurts in Switzerland:

320
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,540
The Bözbergtunnel between Schinznach and Effingen

321
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,900
Had a backlog of three months.

322
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,140
Here a second double burr is built.

323
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,580
Even during the construction of the Maroggia Tunnel,

324
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,460
Three to five months delay according to the last report of the Swiss Confederation.

325
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,980
At present, another access route through the Alps is also blocked:

326
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,620
The Italian Luino axis at Lake Maggiore is being expanded.

327
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,620
But the other routes can not swallow the traffic.

328
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,620
Manuel Herrmann of the Alpen Initiative is therefore criticizing.

329
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,700
The relocation goal of alpine freight transport

330
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,420
From the road to the rail he sees threatened,

331
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,500
If the railways do not seriously tackle the problems

332
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,860
And better coordinate their construction sites.

333
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,820
 You have  problems all summer

334
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,700
 with the coordination  of the different construction sites.

335
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,620
 This has been a problem for a long time  in rail freight traffic.

336
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,260
 In the long term, it is certainly important to communicate more,

337
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,700
 the coordination  also improves between countries.

338
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,140
 Apart from such unpredictable  events it is so:

339
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,380
 One would like to increase the cooperation.

340
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,500
 It is getting better,  but we are still not at the destination.

341
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Meanwhile, the time is running for many companies.

342
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,740
The container contents are not indefinitely durable.

343
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,180
 Of course we have big problems:

344
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,220
 We have thermograms,  we have 200 ° C hot concrete

345
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
 and that will be hard,  if you can not heat it.

346
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
 Now we have containers,  which are somewhere on the orbit,

347
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,580
 and that could be hard.

348
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,580
 This will lead to massive  damage claims.

349
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,500
The route at Rastatt will be free again on 26 August,

350
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,860
But today this was not confirmed by Deutsche Bahn.

351
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,460
The Swiss actor Rene Quellet

352
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,260
Died at the age of 86 years.

353
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,940
To be legendary: "I bi de Rene, and I saw nut."

354
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,860
As a partner with Franz Hohler

355
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,580
In the program "Spielhaus" of Swiss television.

356
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,660
Additional short news.

357
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,900
The leader of the umbrella protests of Hong Kong three years ago

358
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,380
Are now punished harder.

359
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,300
Between six and eight months they have to go to jail now -

360
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,580
Convicted of "illegal gathering".

361
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,860
Nevertheless, the three very young accused want to continue fighting,

362
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,540
like you said.

363
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,340
The Democratic Movement of Hong Kong

364
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,340
Has lost a lot of momentum.

365
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,260
Heavy forest fires in the center of Portugal

366
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,740
Have included 2,000 inhabitants of a village.

367
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,140
The rescue workers try, by all means,

368
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,380
To bring the flames under control.

369
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,100
This summer

370
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,060
More than 60 people have died in fires.

371
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,380
What does Christoph Blocher have in mind?

372
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,620
Not only do journalists, who have been known since yesterday,

373
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,700
That the "BaZ", in which the SVP strategist is involved,

374
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,420
All 25 titles of the Zehnder Verlag took over and so soon

375
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,940
The whole of Switzerland with free newspapers.

376
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,820
Is Blocher concerned about politics or economic interests?

377
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,220
What is certain is that journalists are renowned publishing houses

378
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,100
As today in Berne protest against austerity measures,

379
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,860
Are the free leaves that Blocher buys,

380
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,700
Still one of the few promising businesses

381
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,620
In the newspaper market. Pasquale Ferrara.

382
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,020
Hardly anyone knows her,

383
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,500
But the history of Zehnder, the publisher's family, goes back to the 19th century.

384
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,580
 The great-grandfather is the second,  my father the fourth,

385
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,420
 and I the fifth generation.

386
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,340
The youngest sprout has now given the family heritage.

387
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,460
Zehnder has its 25 regional free newspapers

388
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,300
To the Basel media group of Christoph Blocher.

389
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,340
Price unknown.

390
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,940
Can be the publisher for the political objectives of the SVP man

391
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,020
Clamp?

392
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,380
 Mr. Blocher  does not like losing money.

393
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,580
 He certainly did not invest,  in the end.

394
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,740
 If he made these leaves  SVP leaves,

395
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,460
 then he would automatically lose  reader.

396
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,540
 Then he would immediately  make an SVP sheet

397
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,820
 and can save the purchase price .

398
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,220
The "Wiler Nachrichten" are the origin of the family business.

399
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,180
His success is based on local stories

400
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:04,220
And not on big political issues.

401
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,740
Also this number is according to his recipe:

402
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,380
Stories up close about people you know.

403
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,980
 This is the first issue without me.

404
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,740
 I have not been in Regiomedia publishing since 36 hrs. .

405
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,500
 And the success  has given us right:

406
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,060
 If you stay local,  if you have many heads in it,

407
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,980
 when you see this,  which arouses emotions,

408
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,460
 then you are on the winners side.

409
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,380
Indeed. While many newspapers lose readers,

410
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,140
The Zehnder Group's newspapers have grown slightly in recent years

411
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,860
To more than 850'000.

412
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,180
Such regional free newspapers are economically viable,

413
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,940
Confirms Professor Marc Eisenegger of the University of Zurich.

414
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,300
The purchase is economically not risky for Blocher,

415
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,380
But politically interesting:

416
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,060
 If you look at  the whole history,

417
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,980
 the development  at the "Basler Zeitung",

418
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,420
 also the project,  which we have discussed prominently,

419
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,380
 whether it's a foundation  a free Sunday newspaper

420
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,580
 could come from Blocher,  then you have to assume,

421
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,340
 that this project  also political interests are there.

422
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:16,180
 So I assume that here  substantial political interests

423
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,620
 have played a role.

424
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,100
Blocher did not want to give an interview today.

425
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,180
In yesterday's statement,

426
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,340
Political objectives.

427
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,780
To media diversity and media quality it was today in Berne.

428
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,580
Employees of "Bund" and "Berner Zeitung", which belong to TA-Media,

429
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,660
Protested against austerity measures.

430
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,820
Blocher invests, while traditional publishers save.

431
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,140
No coincidence, the professor says:

432
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,580
 The context is actually,

433
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,740
 the information media today  have a very heavy level.

434
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,340
 One can quite well  speak of a media crisis.

435
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,140
 The resources break away,  very much money is flowing -

436
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
 to the global tech giants  like Google and Facebook -

437
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,580
 and the editorial offices are  and media houses under Spardruck.

438
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,500
 This increases the risk,

439
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,500
 that actors with political  interests,

440
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,900
 to seize this media system ,

441
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,260
 the media  for political interests.

442
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,140
However, publisher Zehnder is convinced:

443
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,180
For political propaganda its titles are not -

444
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,540
With or without blocher.

445
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,940
So much of us. Immediately after "Meteo"

446
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,220
You can continue with "SommerLacher".

447
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,340
Tomorrow, then, my colleague, Susanne Wille welcomes you here.

448
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,980
Have a nice evening and a good night.

449
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,220
