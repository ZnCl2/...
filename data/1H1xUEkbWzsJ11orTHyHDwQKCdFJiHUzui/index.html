		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:25px">It has come to my attention that my sites are getting shared out of the places im sharing them. Until these people sharing have stopped, the sites are offline.</p> 
		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:25px">If the sharing doesnt stop, these sites will be changing address. Locking out people who got this link shared to them.</p>
		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:25px">I know i'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but you can thank the people sharing these sites. /u/ZeronetHero i see you</p>
		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:25px">These sites will be locked until i am told who /u/ZeronetHero is on discord</p> <br>
		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:25px">Msg for whoever was u/ZeronetHero</p>
		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:25px">As no sharing wasnt a set rule, if you msg me who you are on discord i wont ban you, i wont tell anyone who you are, this is your one and only warning</p>
