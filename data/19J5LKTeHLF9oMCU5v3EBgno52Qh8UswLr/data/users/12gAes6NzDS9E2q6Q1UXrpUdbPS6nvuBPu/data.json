It will have tutorials for people who want to learn how to develop zites (there's already one tutorial, more is coming). It also has a place to ask development questions and get answers. You may be interested in it. I post progress updates about this zite on my [ZeroMe profile](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Profile/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/12gAes6NzDS9E2q6Q1UXrpUdbPS6nvuBPu/krixano@zeroid.bit).",
