I'm requesting this feature because I'd like to use it on my sites, and to help promote it's use so that ID providers aren't monopolized and centralized. Having to add each new provider means that a site will eventually become useless. For example, look at sites that *require* a zeroverse ID. They're unusable.\n\nI'm not a fan of the 'proof of work' thing. It's a waste of CPU cycles, and introduces a delay for people joining a service. I'd rather *not* have to buy a $200 GPU and then run it for 3 days before I can use zeronet properly. Why introduce fees and cost requirements to use the service? Really makes me wonder about the future of ZN: high connectivity with clunky blockchains, huge wasteful CPU requirements, high dollar barriers to entry, restrictive websites. I'm not a fan of these ideas. ZeroNet is great because it's decentralized and lightweight. Can basically be ran on a toaster at the moment.",

And allow zite owners to say whether they want the PoW providers only, a white list of providers, or all providers. Then allow a blacklist on top of that. So you can blacklist some PoW providers.\n\nAllowing PoW providers would mean that new providers can be created and checked, but users don't need to go through that process. Unless that was the proposal in the first place? 2-3 days to create a new cert provider is no problem.\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot. Apparently that's what the proposal was. I was thinking the PoW was on the user's end (creating each individual auth_address/account). As for the naming issue... I fail to see why the cert issuer can't just provide a @whatever.bit address in the first place? KaffieID does this. The domain is actually id.kaffie.bit, as kaffie.bit points elsewhere. But the certs are given @kaffie.bit. Just restructure the cert issuing to include the provider's address (which would use the 1ZeroID thing for PoW providers).

The ZeroWikis are different, as they aren't merger sites (meaning their content isn't shared).\n\n@Klu9: There's very little documentation. Mostly just a couple of api function mentions in the docs, and that's about it. I've been meaning to write up a small example/tutorial merger site, so that people can easily clone it and adapt it to their own use. We probably also need a basic ZeroNet tutorial/how-to/information, which I also wanted to write haha. Lots to do.",
