Nofish assumes(somewhat rightfully so), that linux users are the more technically experienced, with at least some degree of understanding on how things work and can manage Tor on their own(with help of the faq). Most people on windows don't know what 'binary' even means and so Tor is already included in the windows release to make it easy enough for people without any idea how a computer works to get ZeroNet over Tor to work.\n\nOn a side note: The official docs have moved to [zeronet.io](https://zeronet.io/docs)(Clearnet).",

Is there a list anywhere?\n\nNot an official one, yet. But [Innocent childs index](/1J1epG5eMc4bsmh69UctBg4PHEe5B3kYHY/hubs.html) is pretty complete (and also uncensored).",

			"body": "Funny, I've been kind of thinking about this the last couple of days. On one hand I want to be more active here and contribute more, but on the other hand that would require me to reveal more of what I know, which can be correlated with my general interests and be used to home in on myself. And that's assuming that I don't fuck up OPsec while doing so. The only way to somewhat mitigate that is to sprinkle in lies that defer from my real personality, but not only is this disingenuous to everyone else, but now I'm back where I started, lying all the time, to hide who I am(only the other way around), which I was trying to avoid in the first place(what I didn't want to have to do anymore when I was coming here)...\n\nAlso: Nice to see that you are still around.\n\n@caryoscelus: \n>one little slip can make you paranoid for days\n\n+1\n\nAlthough you don't even need to make a little slip to be paranoid for days, the 'great' thing about paranoia is, that you don't even need a solid reason. Sometimes not even fear of what could have been is required.\n>So i think the important thing is to make an informed decision, rather than necessarily trying to stay as anonymous as possible\n\nUnfortunately for some people there is no option to choose from.(Well there still is, but the choice between `Ending your current state of life forever into an unfavorable(and uncertain) future, likely loosing 80% of everything you hold dear(material or not, which includes family, friends, social status, probably your job), people looking over your shoulder on everything you do and (depending on where you live) constant fear of the people around you` and `you better do damn near perfect OPsec or shut up` is an easy one to make)\n@ssdifnskdjfnsdjk@zeroid.bit: Also don't forget to set trackers to tor as well.",
