Anyway, it seems you are running Tor from the Tor Browser Bundle; I run tor as a standalone and it doesn't use port 9151 for the `ControlPort`  but yours does. I think you should check your `/etc/zeronet.conf` file, and ensure you have something like this.\n`tor_controller = 127.0.0.1:9151`\n`tor_proxy = 127.0.0.1:9050`",
