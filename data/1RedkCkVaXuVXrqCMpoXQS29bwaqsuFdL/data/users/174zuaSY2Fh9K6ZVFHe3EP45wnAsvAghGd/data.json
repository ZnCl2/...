This lets the client send pieces of the files to other clients so they can stream it (watch the parts they received without needing to download the whole file before watching - in the case of videos).\n.\nFor any zite that wants to support Big Files, they need to allow .piecemap.msgpack in both their data/users/content.json file (as `files_allowed_optional` field) and the content.json file in the actual user's directory (as the `optional` field)",
