For me i think discussion boards (hub sites) does not relly on single person (merger site owner) so they are more independent. Also people can easily and automatically seed newly added content (images) that was added to the hubs/discussion boards. And hub owners can set own limits on submitted content and user quota. etc. Disadvantage is currently that @mcdev not yet created option to create new hub by a button click and also you have to first visit the hub before you can see its content via merger site (Millchan Engine) which is quite big disadvantage (that the hub site is not loaded automatically).",
