			"body": "@Suzo: No, I'm not a developer. But I remember the times when they were all standard network and smack them, because there was a popular IE. All pages written under it. And when came Mozilla, beginning to have problems, because nobody wanted to modify the pages or page to work normally on all browsers to have to add a patch for IE also. Now comes a situation that all browsers on the market use Blink, or are modifications of Chromium and although Gecko age, it is relegated to an unnecessary shadow. Before Servo will replace Gecko it will pass a lot of time, and created an unhealthy situation. Especially that what promotes Chromium does not have to be a good standard. When we have the balance of power in the market, we have a balance and better technologies are used. @weakish: Thanks for answering my question.",
