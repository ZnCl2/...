			"body": "It always bewilders me how a people can still have faith in a government to create security when many parts of it obviously work to undermine that security, and even when they are very invasive they still can't stop the bad guys.\n\nI do like how Lindsey Graham changed his mind about encryption stating: \"It's just not so simple, and I'll end with this. I thought it was that simple, and I was all with you, until I started getting briefed by people in the intel community and I will say I've been a person who has been moved by the arguments about the precedent we set and the damage we may be doing to our own national security.\"\n\nJohn Oliver has a really good/funny skit about encryption, security and Apple here, if you haven't seen it yet:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjZ2r9Ygzw\n",

At least in England and the US politicians are also playing around with the idea of outlawing encryption.\n> In the US I don't think they would get away with it, too many companies behind encryption and the US has legal bribery (lobbying) after all so it will always act in companies' best interest.\n\nThey are more likely to do things secretly rather than openly like they tried with Apple. At the same time a lot of businesses make money off of secret government deals, or special arrangements (regulations, privileges) that give them a virtual monopoly in an industry, plus the government can secretly coerce them to do things for them. Again the US government is fascist but the people don't know what fascism means (some think dictatorship) and so can't recognize and call it what it is.",

What a day.\n\nThat sucks. I think this is just escalation of what happened with Apple.\n\nIt's entirely ridiculous to give up security and privacy for something that kills less people than car accidents!",
