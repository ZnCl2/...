Why is it written in this bloated, huge and slow, high-level scripting language? Is it basically because that's what people know, and is \"easiest\", or are there some reason I can't comprehend? I'd imagine this kind of project would be perfect with a efficient C backbone, and then with the GUI written in Javascript on top. Or is it something I'm not seeing in the big picture here?",
