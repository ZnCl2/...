				"body": "I am split right now : The wish for seeing it growing is big as the concept came to my mind nearly 2 decades ago and i am lucky to see some like that happening right now ; On the other hand , I see too much reinventing of ( in my opinion ) critical design errors that lead any great idea to nirvana in NUL-time .\n\nExample given :\n\n: The obvious structureless structure , means that as a user you are not aware of what happens in the back is not a trustful way to gain audiences .\n\n: The fact that it runs on python could be okay but personally i am freaking out anytime i have to go with that crap, because it is just what it is named after , a gigantic killing thingy slimy , biting , fighting and anytime all contributors accepted that it became to monstrous, it crawls out of its skins and resets time - looping the whole crap over and over . -- Yes, i hate this ( i wouldn't even never mention it a ) ... language . -- Too much power , uncontrolled, relying on structuring that on no single machine ever behaves in the same manner as in any other .\n: As far as i can see, these two before named problems have already manifested in the effort to set up a peer-based decentralized network ; Things seem to function , but when a problem arises you have no chance getting into it , without searching, learning, scraping out things on your own under the premise of knowing more than fundamental stuff of a language that is none .\n\nAs a conclusion ; If itself it do not show as a module-based holder of open-sourced modules that rely on simple needs to run full-fledged over time , like having\n\n: a clean simple readable structure , syntax , grammar ( NO - it is not an advice to say Python is needed and PEP8 is recommended - think of the effort one willing to contribute has to go through to understand that )\n\n: everything contained ( YES - the biggest problem of programs | operations is to communicate themselves , especially if saying pre-optimization is evil, whilst itself pre-optimizing to the max --- simple solution : anything with the right to exist , has to have a place it can exist in )\n\n: naming conventions ( the ones used are short-sighted and have been over 2 to 4 decades right now --- Why is anyone thinking that just specifying SOME rules fights the misuse of MANY rules that came to mind out of probing and creative thinking , because they feel naturally ? )\n\n: mark-up ( where is it ? what i am allowed to do ; What are the limits ; Where one can define its mark-up as a simple module to check for --- because it would prevent misuse by those coming after you )\n\n: communication ( Well , we can communicate right now , but what i don't now by now , is : Where is it stored EXACTLY , how can i control it , what is the performed workflow in the back , how to couple up with techniques already in use , etc . )\n\n: compression ( Things can be compressed syntactically and that should be allowed, there is no need to request compressing binary or not --- least one , should be an option but at any time independent of the basic rulesets )\n\n: viewports ( Where can i define a view , a perspective to things ? How to style up the sugar behind ? How to reflow without manipulating the origin ? )\n\n\nJust some thoughts on that ; Maybe you like to share yours , too ?\n\n\nTHANKS fOR YOUR INTEREST .\n\nPAETH CLAUDIUSRAPHAEL\nS466531257 BOSS",
