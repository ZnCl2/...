When a peer got a new and valid file he/she publishes to 5 other random peers. Its simple, but has many unnecessary communication, if anyone know better solution please let me know :)\n\nIt would take some work to implement, but you may be interested in checking out the work of Wolinsky et al on collective authorities: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08768v1.pdf\n\nI can think of quite a few positive implications a cothority scheme would have for ZeroNet, especially considering your efforts in implementing ZeroID.",
