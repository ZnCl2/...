			"body": "If I create a new clone of the ZeroNet github repository, and start zeronet, then visit a largish site, the site does not load and I do not get a prompt asking for a size increase. As a test I used [bluishcoder blog](/1BLuish1ZbwVfPaCSDVQkg5WW58hqEoYQw). The logs for zeronet show:\n\n\n    Site:1BLuis..oYQw content.json: Site too large 101655706 > 10485760, aborting task...\n\nBut no JS prompt appeared to ask me to increase site size. I see to recall it used to do this. Has something changed?",

At the moment I have to scan all the dates and try and work out which ones I haven't seen the updates for.\n\nWith regards to namecoin, you could provide an option to link to a local namecoind to do lookups like bitmessage does. Another option is to have a site that has a json file containing a dump of all valid zeronet namecoin names pulled regularly from the namecoin client. All users that have this site retrieved can then use that json for lookup.",
