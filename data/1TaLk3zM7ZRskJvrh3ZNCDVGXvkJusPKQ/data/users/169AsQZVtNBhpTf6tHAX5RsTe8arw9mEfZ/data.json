You don't need the search field at the moment as long as there is no working search engine for zeronet. Also you should mention on the front site that you can DONATE Namecoin directly to every example.bit site.\n\nThis would boost Namecoin Adoption amazingly and people can give Namecoin as a gift to other zeronet site owners to register their own .bit domain.\n\nZeronet Sites supported on this way via Namecoin human readable direct donations to d/example.bit will boost high quality content on ZeroNet !\n\n\n\nThink about it - Win / Win Situation.\n\nNofish: You are on the right way ...
