It is not used to run hidden service, but to setup a site anonymously and let other people access it ( store it ) without Tor. \n\nJust added socks proxy + http tracker support, looks like everything is working well using Tor. If no other problem found i'm going to publish it in next days.",

Socks proxy support only allow you to browse zeronet content, but you can't create new sites using it.",
