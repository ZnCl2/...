The problem is going to always be how to decentralize the crawling - either locally you peer every single website, or some remote server generates compressed data files ( e.g. thumbnails of images) which are downloaded. \n\nBTW, discovering sites is easy - just look on namecoin blockchain; it's downloading them all that is hard. \n\nThen again - google search doesn't run off one single computer anyway ;(.
