				"body": "> [nofish](#comment_158_2): ZeroNet sites have the same permission as any other sites you visit over the internet, so they does not able to execute any file on your computer.\n\nThis is not true.. other sites on the internet pop open a window asking where you want to save the file if it's an .exe.... Simply by visiting a zeronet page, you could download an .exe that is included in the website. This is just ONE example: If the user is using an older version of Internet Explorer for example, an active script could be used to execute that .exe - Game Over.\n\nEzekiel has a great point, and this NEEDS to be addressed...  Even if it's a list of files before you download so that you can approve the files that get downloaded, and enable you to select what you want/don't want from the list.\n\nThis has issues, but you could also build trust system of some kind.",
