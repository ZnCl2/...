			"title": "Three Bitcoin tools placed on ZeroNet/Namecoin - Coinb.in, BitAddress, BrainWallet",
			"body": "I've put all three tools on ZeroNet/Namecoin:\n\nZeroWallet - http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroWallet.bit\n  This is just Coinb.in right now, but I am thinking about altering it to use your ZeroNet private key and making email/password for the Wallet page optional.  I would also like to make the wallet page the landing page.  Wallets based on the login are single address only without me making modifications to it though.\n  The ability to sign, verify, and generate addresses is also available.  The site is 100% offline available, but uses btc.blockr.io for a bitcoin network connection when needed.  \n\n\nBitAddr - http://127.0.0.1:43110/BitAddr.bit\n  This is a mirror of bitaddress.org.  The site lets you easily generate paper wallets, bulk paper wallets, threshold addresses, brain wallets, dice based addresses, etc.  The site is 100% offline available. No modifications are planned.\n\n\nBrainwallets - http://127.0.0.1:43110/Brainwallets.bit -or- http://127.0.0.1:43110/15jy2npsEZsGsWMavAdJmV1NZBPeLUpfPG (the namecoin record had a typo that I recently fixed, hasn't confirmed all the way or been picked up by dnschain).\n  This is a clone of brainwallet.github.io.  This site provides an array of signing, broadcasting, generating, and conversion tools.  The site is 100% offline available. No modifications are planned.",
