<h2>Nintendo 3DS Review</h2>
<div class="postinfo"> impressions from hands-on testing at E3</div>
<p>Without a doubt the Nintendo 3DS is an outstanding hardware. It surely makes the use of 3D glasses just a thing of the past. What makes this display system a real genius is Nintendo 3D slider. By adjasting the slider, you no longer have to worry about getting your eyes strained because of too much exposure to the effect of the 3D. You have definitely nothing to complain about  most especially when it comes to the images because it does not show any kind of dullness or fuzziness in the graphics - they are crisp and sharp.</p>
<p> If you decided to try first the game 3DS Starfox64, which is a remake of N64 title, you might eventually end up thinking that this was a big mistake to get started with this game because you might have some difficulty adjusting your eyes to the effects of the 3D. You may want to try instead the game Metal Gear Solid 3, and once you see the alligator swing and jump on the screen, then that would definitely be the time that you will be able to appreciate it. If you really want to appreciate the game even more, then I suggest that you check out the 3DS version of 3D Pong as it will definitely work great.</p>
<p> It would be very important to keep in mind that as you are trying to play any of the 3D games, you have to see to it that you are at a stationary position because it may not be advisable to play it while you are on the road.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.sc3ds.com/">SuperCard DSTWO 3DS Review</a></h2>
<div class="postinfo"> Advanced Premium class R4 3DS Flash Card with built in co-processor, GBA emulator, DivX player</div>
<p> <img src="img/flash/DSTWO-SuperCard-DS2.jpg" alt="DS-Xtreme DSX" width="128" height="128" align="right" class="author" />The SuperCard DSTWO is a flash card from Nintendo that is compatible with NDS, SNES, MAME, DSi and GBA games. SCDS2 is also versatile in that it can be used to listen to MP3, read eBooks, watch DivX or Avi movies, and process other media formats. Aside from these things, SuperCard DSTWO can use plug-ins which helps facilitate the search for emulators and other necessary software applications in the main menu. This flash card can be bought from Nintendo and its distributors in a simple box that comes along with a USB micro SD card reader, SCDS flashcard, and a simple manual that can guide the user on how to play games on the 3DS. You can start with ease by simply downloading and unzipping the DS ROM torrent games. Transfer these to a micro SD card so you can start playing games, reading eBooks, viewing pictures, listening to MP3 files, and using other plug-ins and applications. These are the features in the flash card that can entertain you when you use it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Main features of the Nintendo SuperCard DSTWO DSi / 3DS flash card that a user can enjoy are such as:
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Built-in <strong>GBA Emulator</strong> for 3DS and DSi consoles that have no Gameboy cartridge slot.</li>
<li>Built-in <strong>DivX Player</strong> can play Avi / Mkv / WMV files directly without any need for re-encoding on PC. (other R4 Gold 3DS / R4i

<li>Built-in exclusive SNES emulator with full Speed and Sound support like no other R4i has.</li>
<li>Built-in special MAME emulator that takes advantage of ectra CPU in the card.</li>
<li>Can use all emulators that R4 has - NES, GB, GBC, SEGA, Atari, ZX Spectrum and others</li>
<li>Integrated MP3 Player that we have come to ecpect from any R4DS card!</li>
<li>Real time game guide (can Pause a game and check the walktrough file)</li>
<li>Real time save (saving the progress at any place in the game more stable for 3D games)</li>

<li>Slow motion with four-level speed</li>
<li>eBook reader that supports JPEG, BMP, PNG, GIF, TIF, PDF, and TXT</li>
<li>Hardware defense against anti-piracy without patching needed</li>
<li>Intelligent clean mode (automatic detection of save types and memory card speed)</li>
</ul>
<p>The software used in the Nintendo 3DS R4 SuprCard DSTWO flash card (SC3DS) has a slick menu similar in style to the DSi menu. It looks just like any top quality software as it is surrounded by the standard purple background. It is has a menu that is user friendly, given that it can be used with great ease. Navigation is quite easy to do and understand. The menu is also a great help in launching homebrewed games, eBooks and emulators. All you have to do is to tap on the icon of the task that you want to do. To start a game going for GBA or DS, just drag and drop it to the playing field. To set up plug-ins in your menu, just put any emulator or homebrew in the flash card and put the plug-in. The plug-in that you will use already has an icon that can be used in the menu and an .ini file which are all available in the folder. If you want to start running games, no patching is needed. As long as you have clean ROMs, they will function well when used in the SuperCard DSTWO. The team behind this flash card is always ready to update the software used in it. By updating, this involves adding new items to the flash card and upgrading the old ones to keep up with newer requirements. Before this flash card was launched, the team promised a great feature in the AVI movie playback which is the drag and drop, plus the SNES emulation. Now, the players are still waiting for these features to be incorporated to SuperCard DSTWO. The team though is still continually working on updating the flash card. On the other hand, the homebrew community is working nonstop in making new items that can be used in the card. They have already come up with emulators, plug-ins and games. Some of the plug-ins that they have made are clocks, organizers, and many other useful applications. </p>
<h3> How DSTWO the Built-in GBA Emulator of SuperCard DSTWO Works</h3>
<p> The GBA emulator in SuperCard DSTWO works by updating the firmware in the flash card. This is the main function of the built-in emulator at least, for most games. It can be used only after tweaking it to work with games that run smoothly, games with graphical errors, and games that are quite slow. The use of the emulator sometimes work and sometimes don't with some games. However, the SuperCard team is still working on an updates version of this emulator. Despite some of its flaws, it is still a necessary feature that should come with your GBA games when you use the slot 1. The truth is, SuperCard DSTWO is the only flash card with a slot 1 option that has a built-in GBA emulator. It also has other built-in features which make the games even more entertaining, such as cheat codes and frame skip options. It would have been better to see an option that allows the players to have a full screen playback of the games that are being used as well as large screens for playing with DSi and DSi XL. Right now, the game still has a black border surrounding it. Hopefully, a full screen game option will be available in future firmware updates that will be made by the SuperCard team. There are other enjoyable features that many players have surely noticed too, such as 24-hour clock and real time saves. I have not seen any issues with these features yet. </p>
<h3> SuperCard DSTWO 3DS Game Back-up Compatibility</h3>
<p> After I bought the SuperCard DSTWO 3DS flash card, I predicted right there and then that the card will work just fine for playing games. It has been released a long time after the first card was distributed. This is why anyone can expect great compatibility from the site. Moreover, the SuperCard team has already proven themselves after being around for a long time. It is easy to conclude that they already know what they are doing. To check which games would work with the unit, I tested several games released from different regions. All the games that I have tested worked just fine with the flash card. This could be due to the easy way of running NDS and GBA games. </p>
<p> The build of the card is quite fair, with the use of a thin plastic. The unit can be easily disassembled by just taking out a single screw. The loaded slot has a spring that is a bit stiff, but is has held the micro SD card securely. It is wrapped in a simple but elegant packaging. It already has everything that you need to start playing games except a micro SD card. It is designed for beginners and even advanced players with its drag and drop options. There are also advanced plug-ins that can start activating games, emulators and applications in a customized menu system. The flash card uses a great menu with touch display and picture icons. The look and function of the menu is similar to that of the DSi menu. The emulator built in to the flash card works well though it still needs some tweaking for some games that do not run well. The eBook reader can be used immediately after just a few clicks. Some NDS games though that I have tried running on the SuperCard DSTWO flash card encountered some technical glitches. However, some games just slowed down due to the low micro SD card speed. </p>
<p> During my homebrew testing, I found out that some of them have problems in working with SuperCard DSTWO. There are homebrews that are already updated work with a plug-in in the flash card's easy interface menu. This only facilitates easy playing. Another feature in the flash card that is worth praising is that you can play GBA games even when you use the slot 1 option, This is a big advantage of DSi and DSi XL users which do not have a slot 2 option. In general, the SuperCard DSTWO 3DS flash card is a much richer product from Nintendo. It is expected that the firmware updates in the following months and some more add-ons that the team comes up with will only make it even better. There are only a few minor issues with the GBA emulation and use of homebrew games, but these can be offset by how good the card is in when it comes to NDS game backups. After testing the flash card, I can recommend it to any player who uses DS Lite, DSi or DSi XL. To come up with this review, I have tried several games to check which one will work fine and most of the games work well with the flash card. I do not expect to see major problems in the way when it comes to playing using this card. </p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Only R4 3DS Card compatible with GBA ROMS / Can Emulate GBA games </li>

<li>Ideal for advanced users due to many options and extra features</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<li>Build quality of the flash card is just avarage and if bent cart seems to easily come apart</li>
<li>Some GBA games have slowdowns and require frameskipping.</li>
<li>Has a premium price in the upper range</li>
<li>Uses advanced plug-ins and features that might be harder for beginners and average users</li>

<h2><a href="#"> Introduction to R4i SDHC</a> and R4DS Game Downloads</h2>
<div class="postinfo"> How we got from playing NDS roms from GBA cartridges to R4DS cards like SCTWO</div>
<p>The very first DS Game Backup Flash card that was compatible with the DSi was the R4i SDHC, and this was manufactured for the market of homebrew. Some time in 2009, during the year’s second quarter, after Nintendo’s release of the DSi, the card was introduced to the market. It had similar functions to that of the former kinds of cards for the DS. This even included a support for the 32GB Micro-SDHC. Through DS Moonshell Media Player user was now able to play various kinds of media, and the updates for the software may now be updated frequently.</p>
<p>During the last quarter of the month of July, this year, 2009, DSi cards were disabled for the mean time, when there was a release of the firmware for DSi. There were a lot cards, like for instance the Acekard 2i, as well as EZFlash, were now capable of patching so that it would now be compatible with the updated firmware. But, unfortunately, it was not possible for the R4i SDHC to do so. Due to this, cards in this form were not used for the console DSi.</p>
<p>In connection to this, the situation made its manufacturers think twice about how the issue may be resolved, and how they would have the means to come up with a card that was compatible. </p>

<h2 class="wideblocktop">Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition</h2>
<div class="wideblock">
<p>Super Street Fighter 4 for Nintendo 3D is a good example of a fighting game is Super Street Fighter series. SSF4 used to be found only on PS3 and 360, but it is now re-released on 3DS rom. The game has been considerably improved and a good deal of 3DS specific features added including online lifeline and accessibility offline. For a game, it has great 3D graphics, which is a bit toned down for HD. This is also because heightening the graphical capabilities of the game means more costs. However, this does not really matter given how good the game is. Its online mode can give you more pleasure with the player's ability to choose a character and to play interactively with other online players. You can fight other players wherever they are in the world as long as they are also online. The game may have some lags but these are negligible. The game's controls are made to be user-friendly. Even if you do not have any previous experience, you can use the touch pad. If you want to step up with your game, you can turn the touch pad off to play like a real pro. The game's 3D capabilities still need some rooms for improvement. It is not also ideal to have 3D if you are still playing the game using buttons. It would be doubly harder to play, press buttons and process the 3D effect of the game. Even if the Super Street Fighter IV still has some weak spots, this is still considered as among the top games.</p></div>
