You could loose those as well.\n\nI had this problem, but thank lord, I was able to recover all of it because I make backups (manually) of my files onto two different disks. Don't forget to do that as well, fellow user !"

			"body": "You might have noticed I just started to host two new ZeroProxies:\n\n- https://proxy1.zn.kindlyfire.me\n- https://proxy2.zn.kindlyfire.me\n\nIn this post, I will teach you how to host your own.\n\n---\n\nFirst things first, you need :\n\n- A domain name pointing to your server (I will refer to it as `domain.net`)\n- A VPS running Debian 8 (You can get one at [DigitalOcean](https://proxy1.zn.kindlyfire.me) (ClearNet))\n\nConnect to your VPS, on Linux and MAC this would be:\n\n```\n$> ssh root@server_ip\n```\n\nUpdate it:\n\n```\n$> apt update\n$> apt upgrade\n```\n\n## Setup the domain name\n\nThe domain name you want to use, here `domain.net`, needs to have an **A** record pointing to `server_ip`. You can check this with `dig`:\n\n```\n$> dig domain.net\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.8-Ubuntu <<>> domain.net\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 32341\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;domain.net.\t\t\tIN\tA\n\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\ndomain.net.\t\t253\tIN\tA\t164.132.6.35    <=== THIS IS IT\n\n;; Query time: 23 msec\n;; SERVER: 127.0.1.1#53(127.0.1.1)\n;; WHEN: Fri Jun 17 23:02:44 CEST 2016\n;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 58\n```\n\nRefer to your domain name provider for help on how to set it up. If you use CloudFlare as DNS provider, make sure CloudFlare protection is disabled for the A record.\n\n## Get ZeroNet up and running\n\nWe will have to download, extract and make ZeroNet run with `forever`. Let's start:\n\n```\n$> wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroBundle/raw/master/dist/ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz\n$> tar -xvf ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz\n$> rm ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz\n$> wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash\n$> . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh\n$> nvm install 5\n$> npm install forever -g\n```\n\nNow we have both ZeroBundle and forever installed, let's launch it once:\n\n```\n$> cd ZeroBundle\nZeroBundle/$> ./ZeroNet.sh\n```\n\nOnce you see the following (underneath), hit `CTRL + C`.\n\n```\n[14:12:02] Ui.UiServer --------------------------------------\n[14:12:02] Ui.UiServer Web interface: http://127.0.0.1:43110/\n[14:12:02] Ui.UiServer --------------------------------------\n```\n\nNow that ZeroBundle downloaded ZeroNet, we can enable the `Multiuser` plugin.\n\n```\nZeroBundle/$> cd ZeroNet/plugins/\nZeroBundle/ZeroNet/plugins/$> mv disabled-Multiuser/ Multiuser/\nZeroBundle/ZeroNet/plugins/$> cd ../..\n```\n\nZeroNet is installed and we are not going to let it run yet. Before, install Tor using [these instructions](http://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#how-to-make-zeronet-work-with-tor-under-linux) (ClearNet). After that, you can run ZeroNet : \n\n```\nZeroBundle/$> forever start -c bash \"ZeroNet.sh\"\n```\n\nYou can check the status of scripts running with forever using `forever list`.\n\n## Generate an SSL certificate\n\nNo, you're not going to pay for it. We'll use `certbot` by LetsEncrypt, it's free ! You will have to renew your certificate every 90 days though (edit: this is now done automatically thanks to a cron job added by certbot).\n\n```\n$> echo \"deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list\n$> apt update\n$> apt install certbot -t jessie-backports\n$> certbot certonly -d domain.net --standalone\n```\n\nCarefully read the message returned by the last command, and if it didn't worked then fix the issues it pointed out. If you get a success message, note the file it gives you !\n\n## Finally, install nginx\n\nNginx is like Apache, but faster and just overall better. My friend *angristan* made an easy installation script:\n\n```\n$> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/nginx-autoinstall/master/nginx-autoinstall.sh\n$> chmod +x nginx-autoinstall.sh\n$> ./nginx-autoinstall.sh\n```\n\nYou should follow it as I did:\n\n```\nWelcome to the nginx-autoinstall script.\n\nWhat do you want to do?\n   1) Install Nginx\n   2) Uninstall Nginx\n   3) Update the script\n\nSelect an option [1-3]: 1\n\nThis script will install Nginx 1.11.1 (mainline) with some optional famous modules.\n\nPlease tell me which modules you want to install.\nIf you select none, Nginx will be installed with its default modules.\n\nModules to install :\n       PageSpeed 1.11.33.2 [y/n]: n\n       Brotli [y/n]: n\n       Headers More 0.30 [y/n]: n\n       GeoIP [y/n]: n\n       Cloudflare's HTTP/2 + SPDY patch [y/n]: y\n       Cloudflare's TLS Dynamic Record Resizing patch [y/n]: n\n\nChoose your OpenSSL implementation :\n   1) System's OpenSSL (default)\n   2) OpenSSL 1.0.2h from source\n   3) LibreSSL 2.4.1 from source \n\nSelect an option [1-3]: 1\n\nNginx is ready to be installed, press any key to continue... <press enter>\n```\n\nOnce that's done, we'll have to create a vhost for `nginx`.\n\n```\n$> cd /etc/nginx/\n/etc/nginx/$> nano nginx.conf\n```\n\nFind the line `include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;` and add `include /etc/nginx/sites/*.conf;` behind (or the line after it, just make sure it comes before `}`). `CTRL + X` then `Y` to save. We can now put our vhost in `sites/`:\n\n```\n/etc/nginx/$> cd sites\n/etc/nginx/sites/$> nano domain.net.donf\n```\n\nDont forget the `.conf` suffix, or the file won't load.\n\nEnter this in it:\n\n```\nserver {\n\tlisten 80;\n\tserver_name domain.net;\n\trewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;\n}\n\nserver {\n\tlisten 443 ssl http2;\n\n\tserver_name domain.net;\n\n\tssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.net/fullchain.pem;\n\tssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.net/privkey.pem;\n\tssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.net/chain.pem;\n\n\tssl_protocols TLSv1.2;\n\tssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;\n\tssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EECDH+AES;\n\tssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\n\tssl_stapling on;\n\tssl_stapling_verify on;\n\tresolver 80.67.169.12 80.67.169.40 valid=300s;\n\tresolver_timeout 5s;\n\tssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;\n\tssl_session_timeout 5m;\n\tssl_session_tickets off;\n\n\tlocation / {\n\t\tproxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:43110;\n        \tproxy_set_header Host $host;\n        \tproxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        \tproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        \tproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n\t}\n\n\tlocation /Websocket {\n\t\tproxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:43110;\n\t\tproxy_http_version 1.1;\n\t\tproxy_read_timeout 1h; #for long live websocket connetion\n\t\tproxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n\t\tproxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n\t}\n\n\tclient_max_body_size 20M;\n}\n```\n\nDon't forget to replace all `domain.net` with your domain ! \n\n`nginx -s reload` to reload the nginx configuration and you're all set. You should be able to see your proxy by going to `domain.net`, all good.\n\nIf you have any questions, my contact info is in the sidebar."

			"title": "Make ZeroNet run on a server, safely ",
			"date_published": 1465719661.03,
			"body": "Hi all, I'm going to teach you how to make ZeroNet run on a Debian 8 server and safely. This is what we're going to do:\n\n- Install ZeroNet on our server\n- Install a VPN on our server (optional, see later)\n- Install Tor\n- Run ZeroNet o/\n\n---\n\nThe main reason I make this post is because by default :\n\n- ZeroNet Ui will run on 127.0.0.1, you can't connect to it\n- ZeroNet Ui is open access, everybody could connect\n\nSo, here we go. Let's start by getting a Debian 8 server. Personally I got myself a small 5$ [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplet. Connect to it using SSH, `apt update` and `apt upgrade`, then you're ready to rock.\n\n## Step #1: Download ZeroNet\n\nThis is rather easy:\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroBundle/raw/master/dist/ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz\ntar -xvf ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz\nrm ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz\ncd ZeroBundle/\n```\n\nNow, get your server ip and launch ZeroNet like this:\n\n```bash\n./ZeroNet.sh --ui_ip <server_ip>\n```\n\nYou should be able to connect to it by browsing to http://&lt;server_ip&gt;:43110/ (don't click on that link).\n\n### Step #2: Install a VPN\n\nThe thing we're after now is just having a static IP address. If you have one, write it down and skip this step. \n\nIf you have none, you'll have to install a VPN. It will make sure that when you connect, you always have the same IP address.\n\nMy friend angristan made a nice script to install OpenVPN, it's really easy to use:\n\n```bash\ncd ~\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Angristan/OpenVPN-install/master/openvpn-install.sh\nchmod +x openvpn-install.sh\n./openvpn-install.sh\n```\n\nOnce the script is done, download the file it gives you and connect to the VPN. Searching [my ip](https://duckduckgo.com?q=my+ip&ia=answer) on DuckDuckGo should give you your server ip address, if not, double check you're connected.\n\n### Step #3: Install Tor\n\nThis is rather easy, [follow these steps](http://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/#how-to-make-zeronet-work-with-tor-under-linux) on the docs.\n\n### Step #4: Run\n\n```bash\n./ZeroNet.sh --ui_restrict <vpn_ip_or_static_ip> --ui_ip <server_ip>\n```\n\n>  **Note**: `--ui_restrict` should **always** comme before `--ui_ip`\n\nYou can also make it run with [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) (I will not cover installing it):\n\n```bash\nforever -c bash \"ZeroNet.sh --ui_restrict <vpn_ip_or_static_ip> --ui_ip <server_ip>\"\n```\n\nNotice that if you're not connected to your VPN or are not connected with your static ip, ZeroNet Ui will show you \"Forbidden\".\n\nAnd if you use a VPN, it'll also make browsing clearnet more secure :)\n\nThat's all :). If you ran into any troubles, send me a ZeroMail (kindlyfire) or just comment."
