It focuses on the implications that the presence of extension headers have on the native IPv6 traffic forwarding performance of network devices.\n\nIPV6 EXTENSION HEADERS\nThis section reviews the headers used by the IPv6 protocol.\n\nThe Concept\nIPv6 is using two distinct types of headers: Main/Regular IPv6 Header and IPv6 Extension Headers. The main IPv6 header is equivalent to the basic IPv4 one despite some field differences that are the result of lessons learned from operating IPv4. Figure 1 presents the IPv4 and IPv6 main headers.\n\nThe options field in the IPv4 header is used to convey additional information on the packet or on the way it should be processed. Routers, unless instructed otherwise [1], must process the options in the IPv4 header. The processing of most header options pushes the packet into the slow path leading to a forwarding performance hit.\nIPv4 Options perform a very important role in the IP protocol operation therefore the capability had to be preserved in IPv6. On the other hand, the impact of IPv4 Options on performance was taken into consideration in the development of IPv6. The functionality of options is removed from the main header and implemented through a set of additional headers called extension headers [2]. The main header remains fixed in size (40 bytes) while customized EHs are added as needed. Figure 2 shows how the headers are linked together in an IPv6 packet.\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/en/US/technologies/tk648/tk872/technologies_white_paper0900aecd8054d37d.html\n\nVideo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIDIK55GJ8o\n\nVideo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZJMLcnrb9s",
