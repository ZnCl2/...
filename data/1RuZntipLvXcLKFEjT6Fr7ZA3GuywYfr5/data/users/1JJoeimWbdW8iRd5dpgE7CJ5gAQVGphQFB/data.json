			"body": "(Это сообщение на английском языке добавлено здесь, чтобы также обратиться к русскому сообществу Zeronet.)\n\nHello the Zeronet community,\n\nI am starting a new project where one can put an ad of his/her Darknet website (Tor, I2P, Freenet, Zeronet) on the Darknet Map (www.thedarknetmap.com) as a challenge to try to make as much as BTC 200 by selling squares (the unit of an ad on the Map), but also to allow non-Darknet users to have a quick and easy visual rendering of Darknet websites and to promote privacy tools and decentralized networks.\n\nBasically, the idea is to show that the Darknet is not a place where all websites are illegal/criminal and that the Darknet is difficult to use, but that it is a fantastic tool for privacy with lots of interesting regular websites done by gifted and creative people where the non-Darknet users could also participate by teaching them.\n\nSo far, there are already a few ads/websites from Zeronet linked. As said above, Tor, I2P, Freenet or Zeronet websites in any language or of any region in the world are welcome.\n\nIf you are interested to put an ad of your website on the Map, please read the conditions on the \"Buy squares\" page. You can also contact me by email via my website in case of any question related to your ad/the Map.\n\nBest regards\n\nTDM\nwww.thedarknetmap.com",
