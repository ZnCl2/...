But my idea was to escape from anything USA/CIA made. I was using Debian 8 because i had security worries about Debian 9/10. Also me and my friend had problems with Debian 8 being damaged by a bot or a person and not able to start system. For example that happened to me once exactly after a first Zeronet application use. I could install Zeronet and restart no problem. But when I connected with zeronet network and restasrted Debian 8..... BOOM! Damaged files or whatever and Server X11 doesn't start. I tested two times - TWO TIMES THE SAME HAPPENED :o\n\nI know some of my machines can have INTEL CPU with Management Engine MINIX spying seperate operating system. It has access to my memory and can communicate with INTEL to fuck up my whole OS. Whatever is the reason this doesn't happen with Linux Astra.\n\nI know there are companies that remove clean INTEL CPU of all this shit. But I can't sort it out now quickly. \n\nWhatever your ideas and opinions let me know. Thanks again!",
