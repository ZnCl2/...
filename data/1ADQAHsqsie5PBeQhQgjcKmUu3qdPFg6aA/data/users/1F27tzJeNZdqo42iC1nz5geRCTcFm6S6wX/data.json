			"body": "So I was having a similar issue, where every time I tried to download something that error message would pop up.\nI did as you said and updated to the most recent version. However, now when I try to download something the normal message pops up, the one waiting to turn it into an archive. But now the message will come and go with no download occurring and no error message popping up.\nCan anyone help?",
