			"body": "To mcdev,\nI'm trying to deploy my own Millchan instance. \nWhen a user posts on my instance, ZeroNet throws an invalid content.json error. \n\nI have set up the two main content.json files like yours and signed them.  The issue regards the content.json files inside user directories which seem to lack signature data, causing ZeroNet to throw a fit.\n\nHelp is appreciated.\n\nBonus question: how did you set up your own CA for Millchan?",

So the remaining issues are \nA.) anyone can post with any certificate.\nB.) Self-sign certificates aren't generating.\nIdeally, all certificates should be invalid except ones generated on my zite.\n\nAs for A.), the only permission rule I have is for zchan (the name of my instance) and acceptable_domains in config.ts only lists zchan. So then why can I post using @millchan or @zeroid.bit?\n\nYou can have a look at my zite:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1BbXtvu7LMNnpuRwEytw1ke1Wk8B1i3DTo/\n\nAs for B.), in cert_signers, \"zchan\": [\"\"] is missing its value.\n>I'm assuming you didn't change the \"anonWIF\" defined in that same file.\nNo I didn't. I'm not certain what anonWIF is supposed to be. Is it used to sign certificates? If so, does that mean I have to be online all the time for new users to post if I don't allow ZeroID or another CA?\n\nThanks for your assistance by the way.",
