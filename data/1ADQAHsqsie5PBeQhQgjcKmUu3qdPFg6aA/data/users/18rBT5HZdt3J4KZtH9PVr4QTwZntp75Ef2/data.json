			"body": "Mushoku Tensei has the strongest start so far. Hopefully it stays this way.\nThe egg show is decent enough. 10/10 OST.\nKaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi has been hyped as the next Goblin Slayer but  it was pretty disappointing in that regard so far.\nNo much else worth mentioning from the new shows but there are still some strong sequels this season.",
