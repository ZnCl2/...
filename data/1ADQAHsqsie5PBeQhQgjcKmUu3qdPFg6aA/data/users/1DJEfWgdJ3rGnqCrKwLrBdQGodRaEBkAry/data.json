One way to do it may be to use some plugin that filters web pages requests. Maybe something like Ublock Origin or uMatrix - and [compose some custom rule which will block all non 127.0.0.1 requests when being on 127.0.0.1 page](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1ADQAHsqsie5PBeQhQgjcKmUu3qdPFg6aA/?:users/1DJEfWgdJ3rGnqCrKwLrBdQGodRaEBkAry:zeronet:e81476ed-a373-466a-bb36-0946b39a6d5c). Or finding some browser setting that limits number of connections you can do - i bet browsers already have such limit (duck.com - limit number of connections web browser make page load) so hopefuly nothing to worry about regarding ddos from a zite. Third thing to do is to anonymize your traffic (Tor, VPN) so even if you do some attack, you are anonymous. Maybe there are browser extensions which shows performance impact of the browser tab. i used one in Firefox ESR.",

And creating new and new boards with similar names i do not think is good, prefer if there is a better solution on how members can cooperate to keep boards clean not only for self, but for other newbie users.",

The World Scientists' Warning to Humanity was written and spearheaded by the late Henry Kendall, former chair of UCS's board of directors. \n\nHuman beings and the natural world are on a collision course. Human activities inflict harsh and often irreversible damage on the environment and on critical resources. If not checked, many of our current practices put at serious risk the future that we wish for human society and the plant and animal kingdoms, and may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know. Fundamental changes are urgent if we are to avoid the collision our present course will bring about. \n\nFive inextricably linked areas must be addressed simultaneously:\n\n-    We must bring environmentally damaging activities under control to restore and protect the integrity of the earth's systems we depend on.\n\n    We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water. Priority must be given to the development of energy sources matched to Third World needs—small-scale and relatively easy to implement.\n\n    We must halt deforestation, injury to and loss of agricultural land, and the loss of terrestrial and marine plant and animal species.\n\n-    We must manage resources crucial to human welfare more effectively.\n\n    We must give high priority to efficient use of energy, water, and other materials, including expansion of conservation and recycling.\n\n-    We must stabilize population.\n\n-    We must reduce and eventually eliminate poverty.\n\n-    We must ensure sexual equality, and guarantee women control over their own reproductive decisions.\n\n_ _ _ _ \n\nScientists’ Warning: 2nd Notice (2017)\n\n[Source #1](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/67/12/1026/4605229)\n[Source #2](http://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/sw/files/Warning_article_with_supp_11-13-17.pdf)\n\n\"Since 1992, with the exception of stabilizing the stratospheric ozone layer, humanity has failed to make sufficient progress in generally solving these foreseen environmental challenges, and alarmingly, most of them are getting far worse (figure 1, file S1). Especially troubling is the current trajectory of potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising GHGs from burning fossil fuels (Hansen et al. 2013), deforestation (Keenan et al. 2015), and agricultural production—particularly from farming ruminants for meat consumption (Ripple et al. 2014). Moreover, we have unleashed a mass extinction event, the sixth in roughly 540 million years\"\n\n\"As most political leaders respond to pressure, scientists, media influencers, and lay citizens must insist that their governments take immediate action as a moral imperative to current and future generations of human and other life. With a groundswell of organized grassroots efforts, dogged opposition can be overcome and political leaders compelled to do the right thing. It is also time to re-examine and change our individual behaviors, including limiting our own reproduction (ideally to replacement level at most) and drastically diminishing our per capita ­consumption of fossil fuels, meat, and other resources.\"\n\n\"We have learned much since 1992, but the advancement of urgently needed changes in environmental policy, human behavior, and global inequities is still far from sufficient.\"\n\n\"To prevent widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss, humanity must practice a more environmentally sustainable alternative to business as usual. This prescription was well articulated by the world's leading scientists 25 years ago, but in most respects, we have not heeded their warning. Soon it will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out. We must recognize, in our day-to-day lives and in our governing institutions, that Earth with all its life is our only home.\"",

			"subject": "Scrapebox: Layer 7 http DDoS attack on a clearnet web server using paid tool Scrapebox & free public proxies",
			"body": "OUR AIM:\nThis is a tutorial, concept on how to overload clearnet based web server / website using paid software called Scrapebox (runs under Windows, Mac and Linux (via Wine))\n\nHOW WE DO IT:\nWe will try to use this software to intitiate and maintain up to 500 page load requests in paralel to a site. It will appear like a hundreds of various visitors at once, thanks to free public proxies (one page load / one IP). Software will query user defined list of URLs from same site to cause the overload of the server and bring the website down.\nOverloading third party servers may be illegal in ones country.\n\nBEFORE WE START:\nCheck that the target is not using Cloudflare dos protection (http://myip.ms). If it is, then maybe this attack will not work, but one can try to query random, non existing subpages or pages with parameters like:\ndomain.com/existingpage.php?keywords=randomstring\ndomain.com/randomstring.php?keywords=randomstring\nin aim to bypass the cloudflare cache and make it query destination server. When i used the URL parameter - (?keywords=), then cloudflare response headers are \"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate\" which i hope means page is not served from cloudflare cache, but the query was made to the target server.\n\nTUTORIAL:\n1. Buy and activate Scrapebox - http://www.scrapebox.com/features\n2. Create file that contains all URLs of subpages of a target website.\na) one can try domain.com/sitemap.xml / sitemap.php. Scrapebox has sitemap extractor plugin.\nb) one can try to discover if the site has search function (which may require more server performance and maybe such requersts will not be cached on the server causing higher impact on server performance), copy the search URL like https://domain.com/search.php?keywords= and use OpenOffice Calc or online tool like https://textmechanic.co/Random-String-Generator.html to append random strings to such URL generating millions of URLs. Maybe good to use search phrases like \"a\" which requires server to output many results or use spaces \"+\" in search phrase. Possibly this method is worse than using real addresses from sitemap, because server admin can easier see these are fake request and can distinguish them from real traffic.\nOne can use OpenOffice Calc to create such list.\n3. fill some name, e-mail and website in the Fast Poster area of the Scrapebox. No need to enter multiple because it will be only used if it finds Wordpress comment form (not needed in this case because we will likely not try to overload blog site? we just need to load target website causing load to the server)\n4. harvest proxies using Scrapebox built-in free proxy harvester (you should get hundreds of anonymouse proxies)\n5. In the Scrapebox / Settings / Connections... set Fast poster connection count to the maximum (when i tried 150 connections, it used only maybe 100 webserver connections at a time on my Apache server with Varnish cache, regular Apache max. concurrent connections is 200)\nFor 500 concurrent connections (Scrapebox maximum) i think one have to have maybe thousands of proxies, else too many concurrent connections from one IP may trigger target server firewall rules and block proxy IPs temporarily for like a hour a day or so.\n\nUSEFUL TOOLS:\nhttps://textmechanic.co/ (randomization, deduplication, sorting, counter, permutations, search & replace...)\nhttps://www.browserling.com/tools/extract-urls",

It will show you only boards that you specificaly visited. It will not surprise you by showing a board with bad content (thruth that you can not prevent someone to post offtopic content in your hub).\nDownside of the Millchan merger is that you have to manually find and visit the hub which you want to be listed on Millchan Merger site. I am not yet aware about the way to somehow discover all available Millchan merger hubs.\nTo get you started, Anime & Manga hub address is: 1D23TdnwuQUwNcz5at3m6kyc6Wp1BC4dei ; Anime/cute hub: 19Ccjz6b9b1Adx9U9nQHdH77M2aoubPYMZ\nYou can also create your own hub (discussion board) and promote it to others.",

It is similar like with torrent. more people download your content, better it is for propagation to others, because it will be unlikely that all at once will turn off computer and the content will become unreachable for others (until one or more seeders go back online).\n\nSome peers have CLOSED PORT (you can see it on the top of [ZeroHello](http://127.0.0.1:43110/)) and not using Tor with Zeronet (again you can see on ZeroHello) then it can be a problem for other people (peers) to download content from them, because maybe themself have closed port and no Tor and i believe 2 peers with closed ports can not interconnect each other. So that is why it is good to seed to couple of people to ensure content become \"well seeded\". Some people setup [nonstop running zeronet computers(servers)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/16Go5kc2U9Ff4jeaY8kYiDEgpMYdgyboPY/?Topic:2_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/How+to+Install+and+run+Zeronet+on+a+Raspberry+Pi+or+any+Linux+computer) to host the content non stop.\n\nOne way to DISCOVER HOW MANY PEOPLE ALREADY DOWNLOADED YOUR IMAGES is to go to [ZeroHello and click \"Files\" link](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D/?Files).\nMaybe check /dev/ board and ask @mcdev if he can add feature which will show number of peers of the already downloaded images. (partialy downloaded images show it).",

Imagine that an army of lemmings just jumped the queue at McDonald’s in front of you – and each is ordering a whopper.\n\nThe server is busy telling the whopper lemmings they came to the wrong place – but there are so many of them that the server can’t even see you to try and take your order.\n\nTo generate these garbage requests, bad guys use “botnets” made up of computers of unsuspecting users which were infected with malware at some point in the past. This makes a DDoS similar to the zombie apocalypse: one of the whopper lemmings just might be your grandpa.\n\nThere’s a bright side: All of these lemmings are there just to overload the servers with extra work – they can’t take away your BigMac and coke. Your data is safe.\"",

Lag cause can be according to my opinion: CPU (zeronet exhausting CPU thread and can not use another one), HDD (i think not likely, but in my case it happens that my slow HDD IOPS is not enough to cope with all the activity. zeronet - zeronet is not able to cope all the activities, maybe thanks to many files being queued for downloading, too many trackers, too many peers, too large database. It can be the combination of several factors. I usually check my CPU,Disk stats and close my zeronet tabs except zerohello and if that do not make the delaying zeronet tab to continue proceeding, i restart zeronet - ([ZeroHello](http://127.0.0.1:43110/), three dots menu next to the top-left logo, clicking the zeronet version and clicking the update which make the Zeronet to restart.",

Will not be buying new desktop computer (too big and no power efficiency). I am thinking what are my options. I realy like this computer. It is good performing, it has nicely customized Windows that i do not want to loose.\n\nI can continue using it for my P2P apps, but not Firefox browsing. (i would remove 20% load)\nBut Firefox needs to be at same place as P2P apps, because when searching for the content to DL,  i want to be on same computer where are P2P apps, right?\nSo i have to move only one (or later two) P2P apps to other computer.\nIt seems like zeronet and qbittorrent is the main CPU hog. When i would move the P2P app, i would loose access to the storage device that other P2P apps using on my current PC.\n\nThe main PC is Windows. If new, secondary PC is Linux, how i can get access to the external HDD that is attached to my other Windows PC?\n\nI can be moving ZeroNet P2P app possibly, because other P2P apps are not tied to its data. I would then need to somehow in Firefox setup kind of forwarding that would redirect 127.0.0.1:43110 to my new LAN based Linux computer with ZeroNet.. (i would not use my zeronet pc IP as zeronet links sometimes still contains 127.0.0.1 IP specifically)  Any idea how i would do this forwarding on Windows and Firefox PC? In Firefox? In hosts file? In Windows Firewall?\n\nThe new, zeronet PC would have to be energy efficient ad with high performance for one CPU thread (as [zeronet utilize only 1 thread apparently](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1565037100_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS#comment_92_1EAD2zXkzgJf6M7xQ4jG5FHCxUTez9NJJ4)), this seems complicated\n\nAny flaws in my approach?

			"body": "[This article](https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-good-reason-to-trust-blockchain-technology/) was linked from the [Ethereum website](https://www.ethereum.org/learn/#critique-and-skepticism) and it shows interesting information that blockchain may not be as secure and safe storage as some may think:\n\n\"What blockchain does is shift some of the trust in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography, the protocols, the software, the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely, because they’re often single points of failure.\n\nWhen that trust turns out to be misplaced, there is no recourse. If your bitcoin exchange gets hacked, you lose all of your money. If your bitcoin wallet gets hacked, you lose all of your money. If you forget your login credentials, you lose all of your money. If there’s a bug in the code of your smart contract, you lose all of your money. If someone successfully hacks the blockchain security, you lose all of your money. In many ways, trusting technology is harder than trusting people. Would you rather trust a human legal system or the details of some computer code you don’t have the expertise to audit?\n...\nPeople have to trust the software and the operating systems and the computers everything is running on. And we've seen attacks against wallets and exchanges. We’ve seen Trojans and phishing and password guessing. Criminals have even used flaws in the system that people use to repair their cell phones to steal bitcoin.\n...\nMoreover, in any distributed trust system, there are backdoor methods for centralization to creep back in. With bitcoin, there are only a few miners of consequence. There’s one company that provides most of the mining hardware.\"",

The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights and the South African High Court in Pretoria have an opportunity to declare that bulk interception of internet traffic is a serious violation of the right to privacy.\n\nTo be continued…",

It won’t have the new web features or performance improvements of modern versions of Firefox, nor does it support watching certain kinds of video with DRM.\n\nMore importantly, basing a browser on such old code makes security patches harder. Pale Moon’s developer tries to keep up with Firefox security patches, but he’s maintaining old code that Mozilla has abandoned. Mozilla reportedly has over a thousand employees, while Pale Moon has one primary developer, trying to maintain a huge amount of code that’s becoming increasingly outdated. The older code also omits features that help make modern browsers so secure, like the multi-process sandboxing features that have finally arrived in Firefox Quantum.\n\nBesides, Pale Moon tends to perform worse on browser benchmarks compared to modern browsers, which isn’t surprising given its age.\"",

They are the experts and know what they’re doing. Recently we’ve planted acacia trees, which are good for drought, in Burkina Faso; fast-growing, protein-rich moringa trees in Peru; and mangrove trees in Madagascar.\n\nWe are a small company of just 45 people, and one of our most important teams is our tree-planting officers. Their role is to ensure the tree planting is actually happening and the trees are surviving.\"\n\n\"recently we have become what’s known as a steward-owned company, and it’s now legally irreversible not just to sell Ecosia but also for anyone to take profits out of it.\"",

			"body": "Thursday, July 8\n\nThe reasonings of the wise men are futile.​—1 Cor. 3:20\n\nIn the days of ancient Israel, Satan used false religion to promote immorality. Today, he does the same. False religion tolerates and even promotes immoral conduct. Consequently, many who claim to serve God have abandoned his clear standards of morality. The apostle Paul describes in his letter to the Romans what has been the result. (Rom. 1:28-31) Among “the things not fitting” are all forms of sexual immorality, including homosexuality. (Rom. 1:24-27, 32; Rev. 2:20) How important it is for us to stick to the Bible’s clear teachings! Human philosophy ignores or contradicts God’s righteous standards. It does not nurture the fruitage of God’s spirit but, rather, “the works of the flesh.” (Gal. 5:19-23) It generates pride and arrogance, and the result is that people become “lovers of themselves.” (2 Tim. 3:2-4) These qualities are the opposite of the meek, humble spirit that God’s servants are encouraged to have.​—2 Sam. 22:28. w19.06 5-6 ¶12-14",

I think that i do not need to say that these people have no obligation to spend their free time developing for the project that has no active maintainer and do it without any financial reward...\nBtw. there is a heart icon on the top of the page. Maybe it will help to talk to devs (also on ZeroTalk?) and offer them to pay for development?",
