If you don't pay, you come here to soak up free shit and tell others how worthless the content is they are providing you.\nInteresting. Nice to see we brought all the best parts of the internet to 0net.",

			"body": "I'm a diamond pat for Nigri. Have been for several months now. I don't post stuff here because there's too many people being turds about the whole thing. \n\nBut for those of you interested, the $150 isn't just for digital content. Every month I get polaroids, stickers, 4+ prints (two 8.5x11, two 11x17, and a bonus or two), and random stuff like magnets or keychains. You also get access to a private Instagram account, occasional Google Hangouts sessions, and the ability to talk through DMs on Patreon. We also get to drop ideas for shoots, like the upcoming Mandalorean/Baby Yoda shoot she just wrapped that will be out next month.\n\nIf all you want is spank material, yeah, it probably isn't worth it. But if you want all the other stuff, maybe it is. But if you're not paying, and you're coming to this board just to be a little bitch about the whole thing, can't you find anything else to occupy your time? No? Of course not...because you still want that free shit to rub one out to.",

You're literally doing everything you could possibly do to ensure content sources dry up. \n\nWhat exactly do you think the chain of events is going to be when gumroad purchases don't match up with Patreon subscribers? Or DropBox access doesn't match the user accounts of subscribers?\n\nAss clowns like you is exactly why I rarely share content from my subscription. Because you have to always go that extra retarded mile and risk fucking things up for everyone.\n\nUse your fucking head, or at least look back through prior posts in this channel to see how this shit plays out.",
