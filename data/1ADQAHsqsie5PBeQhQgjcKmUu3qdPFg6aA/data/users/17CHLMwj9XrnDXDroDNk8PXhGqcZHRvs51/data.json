Using 0gallery, tagging or helping distribute it?\n\nMaybe I misunderstood you, but the benefit of using zeronet to host a site is, that you are no longer dependent on money to run a website. That means you don't depend on advertisers(or the host himself for that matter), that can pull out at any point because 'loli is controversial', leaving you without funding. Which is forcing you to either pay the money yourself, which can get expensive(especially for images) or begging your community for money.

At some point he moved to another country because reasons(not writing them here). He was definitely a lolicon, but I don't know for certain whether or not he also was a pedophile. By the way he acted he might have been, but he never told me, so I don't know for sure.\n>The story\nApparently he had his neighbor come over to watch a movie or something together, where he (I guess) accidentally left his computer unlocked. The guy looked through it, while he was away(maybe in the bathroom, who knows) and found out that he's into 2D lolis. They finished whatever they where doing and the guy walked home. What than most likely happened is that the neighbor told other people(in the village he was living in) what he is into. Some time later my friend got shot out in the open, on his way home. Just like that. He died right there. The end.\n\n**Some details here are made up, so I can be (somewhat) sure, that what I've written can't be linked to my identity.

I joined zeronet quite some time ago. Most of the time I was just lurking on 0chan. After the 0chan dev closed it down I got here, where after some time lurking on /l/ and /b/ the coincloud thing started, which is how I originally got to lolifox.\n\n>>10d96cde-a381-4d76-bb68-cbcebc52aae1\n>How do you know that was the reason he got shot?\nAfter he suddenly stopped responding to messages and didn't answer any of my calls, I got worried and phoned random people from his village wanting to know if something happened to him and got something along the lines of: \"That sick pervert got what he deserved!\", \"Didn't you know, he's a sicko?\" and similar, from most of the people I talked with. So yeah, It's quite obvious that that was the reason, but you are not wrong in asking, I don't know for sure. It could also have been 3d lolis or cp, but as I said earlier I'm pretty sure he wasn't a pedophile, he also had a strong opinion on the morality of cp, so that makes that even more unlikely. That leaves 2d lolis, which would make sense, since I know he had a huge collection, he was pretty proud of(probably speaking multiple TBs worth of images and videos here).\n>Did they arrest the guy who committed the crime?\nTo the best of my knowledge: No. And the most frustrating thing about this is, that it doesn't look like he's gonna be arrested or face any consequences at all(Note: I'm not implying that I know who did it, in fact, I have no clue. But the people there seemed to unanimously agree that his death was righteous, so even if did I knew who it was, they'd probably defend and protect him(or her, for all I know) in court and that is assuming the police there even cares(which they don't)). But that doesn't really matter anyways, since arresting that guy won't bring him back. He's dead, gone for ever now, nothing can change that. I've spend months looking back and trying to figure out what happened, at this point I just want to get closure, so it's best to move on, I guess.",

What nice things have happened to you in the last couple of days(weeks)?\nI'll start: I was driving home from work, where stopping at a red light, I saw a loli, around 11yo. She wore ballet(-ish) shoes, these jeans-fabric hotpants and a really short cut (belly free) shirt and was dancing around the traffic lamp pole. By dancing I mean probably reenacting something she saw on a pop or rap music video, as she was grabbing on to the pole, turning around it and doing that 'slowly-back-bending-pose' while slowly rotating around it and so on. Really made my day.\n\n>>dfc33549-d273-4ae5-9b4c-ecc2bf3f388b\n>By the way, where is that image from?\nI got that one from [lolibooru](https://lolibooru.moe/post/show/43765/2girls-ass-bag-beanie-beidan-bench-blue_eyes-boots)(Clearnet), the original is from [pixiv](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=2441758)(Clearnet)\n>It looks familiar but I can't remember from where.\nI've seen it posted on a lot of chans in the past, so maybe that's why it is so familiar?\n\nOn a related note: I have red the story of [blindmute loli](https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Blindmute_Loli#Story)(Clearnet) again and wondered how they are doing now(10 years later)? Has he posted another update since his last one in 2008? Does anyone know more?\nAnd from the bottom of my heart: Fuck Ryan! There are few things, that make by blood boil that hard, while I was reading through his 'ark'. Pic related, how I imagine him.",

Keyfiles do not increase (encryption-)key entropy as much as one would think, and have no effect at all(on entropy), if you have a 32(ASCII) character password(assuming 256-bit AES). Although, using a keyfile is in general an security improvement over not using one. One just needs to keep in mind, that it is probably a lot less improvement than one would think.\n>This resulted in me learning about this place and a few others networks.\nNeat, so we got to here using similar paths.\n>meeting one of the cutest lolis I've even seen while going to a party\nWhat kind of party lets you meet 6yo lolis?\nI've 'met' my cutest loli back when I didn't have a car and needed to use public transport a lot. She was 8, maybe 9 yo and sitting there with her(I assume single) mother. In her never ending curiousness, she was asking her mother about anything she could think of/spot from her window. You could really feel the amazement in her questions after each answer. She was just the most adorable and sweetest little thing :3\n>Unfortunately, it seems unlikely I will ever see her again ;_;\nThat sucks, but who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and you meet her again.\n>That sounds pretty nice. Is ~11yo your main AoA?\nNo, I'd say it's more like 8yo if I had to name an exact age, but it's kind of like a normal distribution centered at age 8 for me. What is yours?\n\n\nHow do you cope with ~~urges~~ that funny feeling between your legs?\nFor me, I usually turn to **child**erotica and loli-hentai, on very rare occasions I also go for real stuff (modeling, ig, streams **or cp**), but I generally try to keep my distance from these.",

So the entropy increase going from N=0 to N=1 will be way higher, than the increase from N=20 to N=21.(I'm talking about entropy here, because the number of permutations that one has to bruteforce((N+1)! and not just N+1, mind you) increases way faster, than bruteforcing the entropy of the key(**approximately** 2^n ), therefore bruteforcing the entropy becomes favorable really quickly)\n>**Children's parties.**\nSweet. **Sorry, if it's too much of a personal question:** How did you get there?

A pale-yellow-ish shirt and blue shorts, I think. Image related is roughly how I remember her(with different clothing, of course). Can't remember her hairstyle/color and eyecolor, though. Her mother was something around 25(wasn't really my point of focus).\nI think I miss my public transport times, now that I'm actively thinking about it again.

But I have never heard of anyone getting tipped of by YT, which is amazing to me.

You have no real intention or reason to seed it, this leaves tons of videos unseeded if they are older than let's say a week or so. That isn't an issue for live streams, the only time you seed/contribute to it is still while you actively watch it and then it's done and everyone moves on. Thinking about it live streams are probably also better than videos from a legal standpoint, because you have(to some extend) plausible deniability, since you can't know what comes next in the stream and you discard it the moments after you have seen it. Zeronet certainly has the best chances, can't see Tor, I2P, much less Freenet being an viable option, anyway. Maybe ipfs or gnunet, but I don't know enough about these to say anything.",

From here on out convert the private key to WIF then import it with ''bitcoinjs.ECPair.fromWIF(...)'' and let bitcoinjs create the address for that ECPair. This address is now what ''addr'' was before and the posting process can continue as it has before.\n'''Post_time+post_uuidv4+Board_Owner_Address''' will supply additional entropy and guarantee, that the key will be unique for each post.\n'''Auth_address''' is now treated as a persistent local secret. With it, it is possible to recover the address used to make the post and registered in the certificate(or re-register it, if it was deleted for performance reasons), not breaking editing and deleting posts ** not too much so anyways**.\nThat, of course means that adjustments to ''makePost(...)'', ''deletePost(...)'' and ''editPost(...)'' as well as ''checkContentJSON(...)'', ''checkCert(...)'' and ''createCert(...)'' would need to be made. Some important changes would be:\n-The uuid for the post will be computed before the certificates and content.json files are checked(no big deal).\n-The post time is no long the time of the post getting sent over the network, but the time the 'post' button is pressed(doesn't make much of a difference).\n-The ''deletePost(...)'' and ''deletePost(...)'' functions must treat posts older then date_of_update differently since they still use the old scheme. An Idea would be to introduce a new anonWIF, have the CA name be millchanV2 **or something like that** and than treat the post differently depending on the CA name they are created with.\nThis method as the benefit of keeping the user-visible-behavior in tact(stuff like: Deleting the ''Auth_address'' will reset your anonymity(or rather identity)).\nA new key for each post has, in general, the **small** added benefit of making anonymous posts more computationally expensive, which will help against spam attacks.\n\nThoughts on that?",

Considering how they reacted to the nazi induced advertiser exodus, just to protect their image, it is strange to see them doing nothing against the softcore stuff they have there (not that I'm complaining). I'd imagine x00.000 views on a 20 minute PE-exercise video featuring an 10yo girl in stretchy poses and 'funny' camera angles, not being the kind of things they would want to be associated with, but hey, maybe I'm wrong and we have some friends at YT-HQ, who knows.\nOn a sort of related note: I've heard, that there are some people who trade cp through (unlisted) videos on YT. Apparently they encrypt the videos, in a way that makes them appear as differently colored squares(like zoomed in noise), that makes them survive the YT compression algorithm and upload them. Anyone can then just download the video and decrypt it, with the key. Did you (or anyone else) hear about this? The guy I have that from, is not exactly trustworthy, but it sounds possible enough for me to give it a second thought.\n>I'm still not sure 0net is responsive enough to reliably support this type of content.\nTime will tell, but I doubt it will be long until someone at least tries to implement live-streaming.

And if you think they are already there: When do you think will the assets to generate those, become broadly available? Would this mark an golden age of 'cp'(this kind of looses its meaning after that point) or the end for cg porn and/or drawn and fictional porn in general? \nFor me, I think we are just about to make that jump and that we will have some sort of 'cp' golden age. If you consider in addition to that, the ever improving state of TTS(Text To Speech) engines, I think we have a bright future ahead of us.",

Not sure how easy you can import them, but if one of them works: Problem solved **at least for images**!\nAlternatively something that would definitely work, is just writing the image en- and decoder yourself as well as an implementation for resizing them. In a way, that: `file -> img data -> byte array -> {resize} -> byte array -> new img data -> file`. This would be normally impossible, but we are in luck, since we have direct access to the filesystem, through the ZeroFrame api. There are some decoder libraries for this out there that you can use, for example [this](https://github.com/devongovett/png.js/blob/master/png.js) is one for png files, but finding them is tricky, so you probably need to write a lot of them from scratch... this is hard mode.\n\nEdit: \nThis `file -> img data -> byte[] -> {resize} -> byte[] -> new img data -> file` causes funny things to happen, if there is an [link](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1ADQAHsqsie5PBeQhQgjcKmUu3qdPFg6aA) here. **Probably something in the link regex**",

That means out of the box zeronet will communicate with peers of any zite(=website on zeronet) you visit and reveal your ip to them(other peers of that same zite). You can activate tor only mode to hide yourself from them, since you no longer share the zites with your ip, but rather through an automatically generated hidden service. Any communication is done through them, his makes you as basically as anonymous as you can be on tor.\nIn every other aspect you couldn't want more: Zites in general cannot be taken down/offline by any entity(even government sized actors, such as china for example) and do not cost a single penny to operate(=no flow of money involved).\nThe only way this place can die is if mcdev decides to (on purpose) break the source code of millchan and just leave, which he most likely wont do since /CP/ exists and he doesn't seem to mind it.\n>Should I be using Tor?\nProbably, can't hurt to do since we are handling cp here. If you're worried about speed choose an VPN. **At some point zeronet will get i2p support, which you could then use, as well**\n>Is Zeronet safe on Windows?\nZeronet on windows comes bundled with tor, so if you use tor always mode, then yes. **Keep in mind however, that windows is able to access your machine at any time. Windows cannot be made fully secure. If you have the know-how and are able to, I'd strongly recommend you install any linux as your OS, it will increase your security by magnitudes.**\n\n>>31fb9f6d-7618-40bb-ae04-4647025625c8\n>Neat.

Even three letter exploits are more unlikely than on onionland, since there isn't someones home you could raid, to gain control over the server.

But I assure you that it's not and unlike on clearnet, I can actually prove that to you, since all zites on ZeroNet have to be open source. That's one of it's appealing properties in my opinion: There can not be any hidden server side code and there is no server that even could be v& and then controlled by some TLA.

Even still, being required to enable js, to use dynamic zites is really insecure and something I hope will soon be, well, not required for zeronet.\n>Perhaps a safer approach\nDon't get me wrong, that '''is''' the safer approach. Don't forget: To trust is to wait until something betrays you.\nDue to the way ZeroMe and hubs in general work, it is impossible for the hubs to be honeypots. Hubs act as storage zites, one could think of them as hard drives. No js from any hub(if a hub even has any js to offer) is ever executed, if you're using ZeroMe.\nSo in the case of js/html and browser level stuff, you're safe, sibyl and correlation attacks will still work nonetheless, but those work on basically anything right now, since they are really powerful attacks with very few assumptions.\nBut I guess this all requires somewhat deeper knowledge, on how things work, that not many people have, so there definitely is a point there.\nDo you have a good idea on how I could better prove that it's safe/not a honeypot?\n>**Yes.****We could talk there if you want.**\nSure, why not.

To help to get new users started, there is something called the 'ZeroMe user registry' that keeps track of all users that have an id from zeroid or zeroverse, these are the users you see in the 'New users'-section on the right. This means you are able to see(some) user accounts without downloading the hub they are on. If you click on their profile it asks you to download the hub in order for you to view their posts.

But which of both is now the real millchan?\nSome things/issues I noticed:\n- On TBB, the merger throws two `Forbidden, you can only modify your own files` errors. And also every time I try to change the css.\n- There is no favicon on either the merger or the hub.\n- The source code button still points to the not-merger repo.\n- 'recent posts' shows the hub address and not the board name.\n- The board name is not `/SomeBoard/` but `SomeBoard`\n- You cannot unfollow a thread.\n\nSuggestions/Ideas:\n- Maybe have `board.manifest` file somewhere where the board metadata is stored.(Keep board description, title and possible future info, like tags separate from the zite title and description on ZeroHello.)\n- Hub specific css files, where the hub owner can specify a default css for his hub.(the user should be able to always use the 'official' css)",

It will sync posts on clearnet-chan-boards with zeronet-millchan-board-hubs. Do you think it would be beneficial for performance to have all clearnet posted by a single user (all posts from the clearnet board in one data.json and all images in one folder) or just to make new addresses for each post? I would think the first one would be best, because it will introduce less bloat, allows easy separation of clearnet posts and zeronet posts and the time taken to read through one really big data.json should be about the same as ready through many small ones.",

Although the documentation says you need admin permission, if your zite doesn't have that permission, the user will just be prompted whether or not he wants to clone the zite.\nYou can look at the [gitcenter source code](/1GitLiXB6t5r8vuU2zC6a8GYj9ME6HMQ4t/repo/file/?18r929Hq8hE5Pi9Zf7ovMQVyn3WcGfxMgu/main/dist/js/repo.js@master#L2074) as a reference.\n\n>The hub owner has access to the hubs's private key.\n>The means they can modify and sign the data.json file of any user.\n>Unfortunately, as far as I know, currently there isn't a user-friendly way of modifying those files.\nWhy not use the `## Board Owner` interface non-merger millchan has right now?\n\nOn a related note: I just noticed, that [Blacklist] is gone on hub version\nWill you reimplement this? Transparent moderation was one of millchans big strengths.\nThis could be done, by having making a `data/mods` dir and putting another content.json in there. Make it only signable by a `[BitcoinAddress]#owner/[UserName]` certificate signed by the private key of the hub. That certificate will be generated on hub generation. `data/mods/1SomeAddress/data.json` will then contain the all mod actions. \nThis could also easily be adapted for a board volunteer system, where the BO makes an `[BitcoinAddress]#mod/[UserName]` certificate with the hub private key and then gives that to the new mod.\n\n>Either way, I think a single user would be the better option.\nProbably, I think a new user for each mirrored thread would be the best of both then.\n\nEDIT:\n>the annoying hub addresses are now the board name\n<3",

If it does, you should be worried.\n>if we say something that goes against zeronet purpose, we gets shadowbanned.\nYou don't get shadowbanned, at least not globally. Generally, individual users can choose to mute you(just like they can choose to do here). If someone runs a public blocklist, they can choose to add you to it as well, that's about it. Specific zites can implement features that would allow the moderators of that zite to shadowban people, but neither ZeroTalk nor any of the zites I know of have done so.\n>kxoid, does not work\nkxoid requires you to install the `PeerMessage ` plugin, which allows zites to make p2p connections from your zeronet client to other  zeronet clients.",

The reason for that is that the millchan devs have absolutely no control over what the site does and how it's configured. '''Only''' the board owner can do that, but that can also mean that the owner of a hub can set the files on it to required which will download all of them to everyones computer automatically. In the case of, for example, child porn this is a big issue.\n\nHubs on their own aren't really anything special, they are just regular zites, with a marker that tells ZeroNet that it's data can be used by millchan.\nThere is a list of (to my knowledge) all millchan hubs that innocentchild maintains (or at least used to maintain, I'm not sure if innocentchild is still around):\n[innocentchild's room](/1J1epG5eMc4bsmh69UctBg4PHEe5B3kYHY/hubs.html)",
