Still, it's not without conflicts, and one life is at risk. There are two simultaneous plots which creates rather long cliffhangers. The animation is top tier, and the character design correctly distinguishes characters of different age groups. I just hope there won't be too many Asuna abuse scenes, \"irl\" fights or general human abuse, which is the main thing I dislike about Sword Art Online.",

Because of the time acceleration, we have no idea about this season's timespan in the \"real world\". The events in the virtual world might take weeks, months or years in the \"real world\". More than two years have already passed in the virtual world after all. How long is that in \"real world\" time?**\n**The \"filler characters\" were clearly hinting to what happened in the episode released some hours ago. The entire season will propably be about the artificial intelligences gaining a sense of morale, and about laws vs morale and human rights, unless Kirito somehow breaks their world first.**\nI'm still waiting for Akihiko Kayaba's full story. He's quite a mysterious character in the SAO universe.",
