Prior rips of entire JN sub pre-bans\\pre-JN2, the entire Nigri 0net v1 and v2 collections (merged finally), and another collection.\n\nNow I just need to essentially go through, organize folders, overwrite\\compare sizes of images to each set, then compare checksums of videos and then I'm done.\n\nIf you ever need to have a good Image dupe finder, try VisioPics (not updated anymore), and or also an Image and Video duplicate finder (install KCP [codec pack], needs ffmpeg) use SimilarImages.\n\nThe latter really helped with sorting out my Sophia Diamond collection.\n\nMy unsorted (w/dupes)+v2sorted collection of nothing but 0net folders on my D drive is 14.6 GB while my original Nigri folder in my F\\Pics drive comes in at 16.3 GB (lots unsorted\\dupes), so it comes together at a whopping 30GB!!\nI don't have a lot of the newer videos; no one seems to post them. Also I don't keep a few of her older ones due to sheer memery in her videos making them unfappable\\not having sexier recuts either. Definitely have video dupes since some are hiding in the image folders while others are just dumped in to a single folder.\nCheers and sorry about the blog entry and being that faggot that touts he has so much shit but doesn't share. One of these days bros, I'm going to do it to give back to the communities that gave back to me.\n\nAnd shit, I forgot to count her Instagram folder+trimmed Facebook account (I deleted anything that had a width or height under 1280px for images, who the f needs small images in 2019).",
