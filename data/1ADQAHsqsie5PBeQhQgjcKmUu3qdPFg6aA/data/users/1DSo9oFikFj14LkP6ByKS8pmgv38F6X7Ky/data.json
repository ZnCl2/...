Don't be held back! Improve your drawing speed and accuracy now by following along with these videos, and substantially increase the rate at which your art is liable to improve in general.\nHow to Hold and Control Your Pencil (Stan Prokopenko) - http://youtu.be/pMC0Cx3Uk84?t=50s\nDynamic Sketching I (Peter Han) - http://youtu.be/wgDNDOKnArk\nDynamic Sketching II (Peter Han) - http://youtu.be/YFVggG7ajXM\nMotivation and Psychology:\nWhile it can be very rewarding, drawing can also be a very frustrating hobby. Having your best efforts turn out to be less than stellar (or worse!) time and time again can be a not-so pleasant experience, one that has caused more than a few people to give up their artistic aspirations entirely.

One of its biggest downsides is its reliance on cumbersome accessories in later chapters. I recommend the first couple of chapters and then perhaps trying \"Keys to Drawing\" by Bert Dodson-or simply just doing a lot of independent observational drawing after the fact. \nthe Bargue Drawing Course - http://tinyurl.com/lhwokyr\nA very robust drawing course on observational drawing skills\nPerspective Made Easy - https://archive.org/details/PerspectiveMadeEasy\nA book reducing the important and complex concept of perspective into some of its simplest terms.\nImaginative Drawing\nFun with a Pencil (Andrew Loomis) - http://tinyurl.com/npmgqyt\nIn this book the author explains the important concept of construction using \"forms\" in a simple way. It is recommended that you develop good motor skills ( http://youtu.be/pMC0Cx3Uk84?t=50s ; http://youtu.be/wgDNDOKnArk ) and endeavor to understand at least basic observational drawing before reading.\nSuccessful Drawing (Andrew Loomis) - http://tinyurl.com/ld96heu\nIn this book the author further familiarizes the reader with broad",

Americans work harder and produce more than ever but increasingly fall into debt and bankruptcy while corruption rules, and predators plunder society by merely shuffling papers. Less than 1% of the population now owns about 50% of the wealth, and receives 17% of the income! The Lost Science of Money shows how a false concept of money allowed it to happen, and tells how to reverse it.\nThe Lost Science of Money exposes the mythology created to protect those who are embezzling from society, under cover of a deceptive ideology of money. This group has immorally used economic theory as a tool of class war for the past three hundred years, while screaming accusations of ‚Äúclass warfare‚Äù against those who question their power!\nPolitical scientists refer to three branches of government: the Executive; the Legislature; and the Judiciary.\nStephen Zarlenga in argues persuasively and cogently that there is a fourth branch of government, (whether we realise it or not), called The Money Power. The Money Power is the power to issue money in any given country. Martin Van Buren (8th US President, 1782 ‚Äì 1862) coined this phrase, and it will remain capitalised in this book in honour of this truly great insight into the nature and ownership of the money-creation process.\nThis ability to create a country‚Äôs money supply should be the most important function of Government. Because private banks now create over 97% of the money supply, they are in control of the most important branch of Government ‚Äì The Money Power ‚Äì which has effectively usurped the system of checks and balances enshrined in these other three branches of Government in our Western democracies.\nStephen Zarlenga has made the greatest contribution to monetary reform in explicitly stating that The Money Power is by far the greatest of all the branches of Government. The fact that this is not so currently recognised, has led to a marked distortion and corruption of society.\nThis book also debunks any notion and disinormation about Hitler and the National Socialists working for the Rothschild bankers and being in the pockets of Big Business. In fact Hitler and the National Socialists, Mussolini and the Italian Fascists, and other Fascist/ Nationalist-populist movements in the world in general in the first half of the 20th century. Such as the British Union of Fascists led by Sir. Oswald Mosley were against the Rothschild banks. They knew that they had wrecked their nation.\nThe book show the true history of money and the conspiracies and world events that have been shaped by money power. The book is extensively researched and incredibly well cited.\nhttps://archive.org/details/StephenZarlengaTheLostScienceOfMoneyScan44Mb\nhttp://urbanartiphax.com/ebooks/files/The%20Lost%20Science%20of%20Money%20-%20Stephen%20Zarlenga.pdf\nhttps://murdercube.com/files/Money/Lost%20Science%20of%20Money/Lost%20Science%20of%20Money.pdf\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150711220544/http://murdercube.com/files/Money/Lost%20Science%20of%20Money/Lost%20Science%20of%20Money.pdf\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150419025428/http://www.conspirazzi.com/e-books/lost-science-of-money.pdf\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20160217131807/http://urbanartiphax.com/ebooks/files/The%20Lost%20Science%20of%20Money%20-%20Stephen%20Zarlenga.pdf\nhttp://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Money_and_Economics/Lost_Science_of_Money.pdf\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150830010233/http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Money_and_Economics/Lost_Science_of_Money.pdf\nhttp://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=7976EB4C8A58D52ADA4ABD1E18059400\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/275940636/Lost-Science-of-Money-Alexander-del-Mar\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6242482/The_Lost_Science_of_Money_The_Mythology_of_Money__The_Story_of_P\nPost last edited at 03/06/16 (Sun) 00:17:06\n\n‚ñ∂Anonymous¬† 03/05/16 (Sat) 03:49:10 23975a ¬†No.3619\nhttp://theblackvault.com/\n\n‚ñ∂Anonymous¬† 03/08/16 (Tue) 08:55:55 23975a ¬†No.3647\n>>1062\nbedankt\n\n‚ñ∂Anonymous¬† 03/11/16 (Fri) 07:15:01 23975a ¬†No.3654\nddedeq\n\n‚ñ∂Anonymous¬† 03/11/16 (Fri) 07:15:10 23975a ¬†No.3655\nde\n\n‚ñ∂Anonymous¬† 03/14/16 (Mon) 03:36:34 23975a ¬†No.3671\nhttp",
