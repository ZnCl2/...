I don't pay for either anymore because the cost isn't worth what you get. Nigri wants people on OnlyFans to pay for old content that was already available for purchase on Patreon and StoreEnvy. She;s double-dipping like a mofo. She also wants $30 for 3 pics (one pasties and 2 wearing a thong showing her ass). Meanwhile, Meg is asking $20 for 9 pics with actual fully exposed real tits. Not giving Nigri any more cash.",

Seems to me that would eat your data, kill your storage, drain the hell out of your battery, and if you don't allow it to run as a background process it just ain't going to work for shit. ZeroNet is meant to be a desktop app. Some things aren't ready to be ported.",
