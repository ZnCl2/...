That's an excuse to perpetuate the current political philosophy of allowing private individuals or corporations to levy their own economic power in order to privatise and extract public resources, while never giving anything back to the community, never acknowledging the effects of externalities - both negative and positive.\n\nAnyway, I'd highly recommend the works of Kropotkin, which unlike those of bulwarks like Bakunin are written in a far more simple and easier to grasp language.\n\nSpecific works:\n- Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution - an effort to find instances of cooperative behaviour in nature, early civilization and the middle ages in order to refute the Social Darwinist theories of race superiority and inevitable cutthroat competition between men of the day. For some reason the title is not at all recognized as a contribution to geography, natural history or anthropology.\n\n- The Conquest of Bread - where he advocated the communal use of public land in order to grow crops and vegetables by small non-farmers including inside the city. I think this is where he calculated that each man alive need only devote about 180 days in the year to labour necessary to produce all goods and services essential for survival.\n\n- Fields, Factories and Workshops - an overview of the productive capacities of the day (19-th century), cursory overview of intensive agriculture and gardening methods that seem unrealistically productive and might have been forgotten in time.\n\n- An Appeal to the Young - although it's only a pamphlet, it aims to remind intellectuals of the day (and today) of how important physical labour and skills are to developing well-rounded individuals who can better survive, invent and better our collective well-being. It also promotes solidarity with the working poor.",

It's \"A Homage to Catalonia\" by none other than the father of the modern oppressive dystopia George Orwell.\n\nThe book is in part Orwell's memoirs during his participation in the Spanish civil war in the late 1930-s as part of the self-proclaimed anarchist groups of Catalonia / Barcelona, who liberated farming land, factories and workshops, giving control and decision power over to the workers doing the actual day-to-day operations. It also describes how even the army somehow managed to operate without hierarchy.",
