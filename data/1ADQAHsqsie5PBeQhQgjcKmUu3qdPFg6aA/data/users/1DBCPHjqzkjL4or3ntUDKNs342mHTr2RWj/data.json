Rest of the sets were downloading just fine after seeding.\n\n>>2535fc1f-d253-4859-bb67-1b12c92a3eca \nThanks so much for a mega link! I was considering downloading each image individually but then realised that I'd have to rename them too, which would be a hassle.\n\nSorry if this is asking for too much, but can you also upload the other set into Mega if it isn't too much to ask?\nIt's 'Gom Road Pink School Girl' here on this thread",
