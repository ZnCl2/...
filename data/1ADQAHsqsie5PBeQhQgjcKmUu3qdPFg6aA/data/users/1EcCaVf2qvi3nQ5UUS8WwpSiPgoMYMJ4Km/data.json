			"body": "> Most people are skeptical because of cp, and because it may not help us \"that much\".\nTechnically the only thing it gives us (quite a big thing, actually) is resistance to shitting it down. Anonymity is even worse than on normienet and the efficiency of browsing is also noticeably worse. The ease of use is surprisingly good, although still requiring more attention to track size limits of the seeded sites, their content, etc. \n\nSo from the practical perspective the only thing it's better than normienet is a narrow domain of things theoretically legal, but in practice guaranteeing censorship, or theoretically illegal (so automatically refused to being hosted on normienet), but not persecuted in practice.\n\nThat's in the default mode. In the TOR mode the possibilities are much wider and can include everything illegal, but then what exactly does ZeroNet offer that hidden onion services don't? From the host perspective definitely higher security in not glowing with the TOR node, but the user will have to deal with all the potentially illegal content on his/her device, so the total security will be lower.\n\nIndeed it doesn't help that much. What is important, I think, is the potential of peer-to-peer networks to preserve freedom of speech in the - no doubt - increasingly authoritarian future. We want people to get accustomed with p2p technology, to have apps installed and be familiarized with them, to have their favorite pages bookmarked and be more or less fluent in navigating this parallel cyberspace, so they have safety net to fall on in case of normienet blackout. This is the true value of ZeroNet, but it will never be widely appreciated until it's too late. Practical arguments won't work.\n\nWe should try a different angle. Let's create in the collective consciousness the association:\n> Peer-to-peer network = place for NWO rebels\nLet's just make it cool to use ZeroNet. We can spread memes similar to fashwave in style, inducing the feeling of revolt, of freedom and independence, having zeronet logo somewhere and a few links. We can exploit the archetype of the revolting cyber-punk joining the underground network. We can create the aura of ZeroNet fraternity waiting for anons spit out by the ruthless system.\n\nThis is in fact the birth of the new Internet. Everyone who missed it in 80s and 90s gets a second chance now. How can this NOT be cool? Let's leverage that.\n\nDo you get what I mean, anons?",
