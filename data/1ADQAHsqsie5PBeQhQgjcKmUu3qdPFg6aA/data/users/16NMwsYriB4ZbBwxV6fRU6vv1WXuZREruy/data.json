Then click \"Clone\"\n4. copy the newly opened address of your hub to the safe place (possibly good to find your site address in zeronet/data/users.json and backup also related entries like private key)\n5. open site menu (swipe the button in the top right corner to the left) and scroll down and set SITE TITLE, SITE DESCRIPTION (possibly do not use diacritics, special characters)\n6. in the same site menu scroll up and click OPEN SITE DIRECTORY kind of option. You may backup all your site files here and then modify index.html to customize your site text.\n7. then open file data\\users\\content.json and you can add other file types support here and raise \"max_size\" value to give your users more disk space. Default 5000000 (5 million bytes) is 5MB\n8. if you made any modifications to the data/users/content.json, go to your site menu again, scroll down, click data/users/content.json link and \"Sign and publish\" button. (\"Content publish failed.\" should not be a problem as the hub may have no peers yet)\nDo the same signing and publish for the content.json if you modified index.html.[/code]\n\nAfter that share your new board link with people you want to have access to it. It will only appear in peoples' board list after they've visited once.",
