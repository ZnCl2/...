Curious if newbiew users will get new Anonymous identity by default. Because i think many users will stay like that, which would not improve problem of too many Anonymous (can not orientate and differentiate users posts).\n\n>>2e63ec56-2919-43a6-938c-6252472f62bd\nI do not have any problem with Settings menu. Firefox beta here.\n\n@admin thank you for allowing to delete post!!!",

I think the user IDs in the board list is a confusing column and a bit redundant, because the option to mute user is already under Options menu that is opened when one click board name in the board list.\nCurrently it may give impression that when i try to click the string next to board name in the board list, it will \"remove\" the board. I see that when i mute user the board indeed has \"???\" name and its posts continue to appear in \"Recent posts\" section. When i Blacklist board, then it seems to be completely hidden including \"Recent posts\" which is good. I think removing the column with board owner IDs from the board list will get rid of a confusion between muting and banning and it will be more tidy/clean, because user mutting is already there in Options menu as mentioned.",

I have attached the setup example (Capture.PNG) where http traffic (port 80) will be routed through VPN1 interface. Note that failover option is also available.\n\nThere is an article describing this feature, available for registered users: https://www.draytek.co.uk/support/guides/kb-policy-routing-guide-v2\nAlso, our UK based support team can assist you (it is free!) by email or phone: https://www.draytek.co.uk/support/contact-support\n\"\n\n- If you are planning to connect to remote VPN servers run by companies such as NordVPN etc., please make sure that they VPN tunnel requirements can be matched/are available on DrayTek or other vendors' router.\nThe setup for this might be similar to the above. \n1) Make sure that the VPN is established with the VPN provider.\n2) Local PC is set with a static IP address\n3) Route Policy similar to the attached is enabled on the router.\n\n\nPS: [Here is](/1LfvE91ZF18jdG3wW62Dw7NtfTZh737KPL/?Topic:1527007067_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/Dual+WAN+routers+for+internet+connectivity+load+balancing+failover) the NetTalk thread about dual WAN routers.

			"subject": "Testimony of Historians that Jesus walked the Earth",
			"body": "Testimony of Historians\n\nFor instance, consider the testimony of Flavius Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian who was a Pharisee. He referred to Jesus Christ in the book Jewish Antiquities. Although some doubt the authenticity of the first reference where Josephus mentioned Jesus as the Messiah, Professor Louis H. Feldman of Yeshiva University says that few have doubted the genuineness of the second reference. There Josephus said: “[Ananus the high priest] convened the judges of the Sanhedrin and brought before them a man named James, the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ.” (Jewish Antiquities, XX, 200) Yes, a Pharisee, a member of the sect many of whose adherents were avowed enemies of Jesus, acknowledged the existence of “James, the brother of Jesus.”\n\nThe influence of Jesus’ existence was felt through the activities of his followers. When the apostle Paul was imprisoned in Rome about 59 C.E., the principal men of the Jews told him: “As regards this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.” (Acts 28:17-22) They called Jesus’ disciples “this sect.” If they were everywhere spoken against, secular historians would likely report about them, would they not?\n\nTacitus, born about 55 C.E. and considered one of the world’s greatest historians, mentioned the Christians in his Annals. In the account about Nero’s blaming the great fire of Rome in 64 C.E. on them, he wrote: “Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus.” The details of this account match the information regarding the Jesus of the Bible.\n\nAnother writer who commented on Jesus’ followers was Pliny the Younger, the governor of Bithynia. In about the year 111 C.E., Pliny wrote to Emperor Trajan, asking how to handle Christians. People who were falsely accused of being Christians, wrote Pliny, would repeat an invocation to the gods and worship the statue of Trajan, just to prove that they were not Christians. Pliny continued: “There is no forcing, it is said, those who are really Christians, into any of these compliances.” That testifies to the reality of the existence of the Christ, whose followers were prepared to give their lives for their belief in him.\n\nAfter summarizing the references to Jesus Christ and his followers by the historians of  the first two centuries, The Encyclopædia Britannica (2002 edition) concludes: “These independent accounts prove that in ancient times even the opponents of Christianity never doubted the historicity of Jesus, which was disputed for the first time and on inadequate grounds at the end of the 18th, during the 19th, and at the beginning of the 20th centuries.”",
