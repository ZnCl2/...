			"username": "a7",
			"body": "Hello!\nI found the download archive fixed with the latest revision (great!)\nHowever, I found two more things.\na) Whenever I attempt to click on an image's filename (url) above the thumbnail, it does not engage a \"save image\" popup in my browser. I currently cannot save the image as the original filename as I used to before. This was also a problem when the archive issue had arrived too.\nb) Now, with the download zip/archive, it works but... if the title of the post has something that usually breaks a regex (i.e. \"/ \\ |\" etc type of ASCII) it truncates it, and only saves the zip as whatever was after the symbol. For example: a post titled \"My selfies on 06/20\" would save as an archive \"20.zip\"\n\nFor now, I need to still download photos as an archive every time, because otherwise I'll just be saving the hash filename as used with the ZN storage setup. Thanks for 0net Mr. dev!",
