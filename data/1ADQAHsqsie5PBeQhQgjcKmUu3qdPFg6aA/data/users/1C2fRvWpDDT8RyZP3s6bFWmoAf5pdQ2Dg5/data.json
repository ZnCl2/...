According to your formula it will cost only 0.0052 BTC or 43$ to instert a similar image in a bitcoin blockchain. It's affordable cost, I think. Just post link to a simple program which does not requre installation of any additional software and easy to use and somebody will definitely do it.",

Just grab something really hardcore from there or your hard drive.\nI agree with the program author that the image must contain \"something definite CP, that cannot be ignored or waved off\". Anyway it's up to a person who will spend the money to decide what to insert.\nYour results are good. Please write, how did you achieve that?",

All previous files presented in a blockchain somehow managed to avoid this sorting problem. Also adding metainforation will reduce a payload as you mentioned.\nMaybe use a different client, not Electrum?",
