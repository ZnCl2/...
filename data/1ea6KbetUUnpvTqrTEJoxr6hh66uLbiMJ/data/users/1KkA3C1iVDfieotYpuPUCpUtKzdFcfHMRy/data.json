The other day I thought about how we had these neatly curated collections of music on our hard-drives with fine tuned folder structures, covers, naming and all but these days people just stream because it's a mess to move between devices and I'd be fine with a system that allowed me to just curate myself and to export my own playlists together with the files.\n\nAnd thanks, yes metadata is the really hot issue here and I think it needs a solution that doesn't require consensus. You can't get more subjective than genres. Having to flatten multiple artists into one text string is also not very helpful if you try to aggregate stuff later.\n\nI just want something that reduces churn and enables expressive curation.\n\n\n\n",
