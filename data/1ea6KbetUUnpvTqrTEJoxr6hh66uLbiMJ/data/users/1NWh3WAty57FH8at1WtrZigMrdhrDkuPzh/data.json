			"body": "Sadly, file management is honestly the least of anyone's worries when it comes to music. You could easily toss the files in the same folder with random names, and then have the client figure it out through ID3 tags. Not a big deal.\n\nThe bigger issue is correctly tagging and managing names/labels/artists/lyrics/genres/etc. As you mentioned in the post, there's stuff like discogs or musicbrain. But these are really lacking when it comes to anything outside of what's popular. For instance, only one or two of the albums I have are actually listed on musicbrains. Discogs has nothing I listen to. They both have a weird focus on *physical releases*, which are going away. I've found, ironically, that *last.fm* tends to have the best information. But even that site comes with it's own problems: shared artist pages, the horrible management which leads to the site becoming unusable every year, the closed nature of it's DB, etc.\n\nI was thinking it might be possible to make a clone of ZeroWiki and just change the focus to be music. But ZeroWiki ends up having a lot of redundant data due to how it allows people to change the content of the pages.\n\nPersonally, my current setup involves getting music from thepiratebay or dojin.co, tagging them manually myself, and then listening through itunes and on my ipod. It works, but due to the failure of ID3, the complexity of music labeling, and the crappy tag recognition/management of apple music software, I end up simplifying the tags and things don't come out quite accurate. I also tend to lack a lot of information (I just do artist/album/track/genre).",
