			"body": "There is [a ZeroBlog that supports tag and date index](https://github.com/zeronetscript/ZeroBlog/tree/toc_by_tag), but it's based on an old version, which doesn't support alloy-editor and image inserting yet. I use the awesome [meld tool](http://meldmerge.org/) and merge the code base, also add some mobile support. [The source code](/1M5dciFFSWt4wKs9Nnxa34BgGnt7os7h3v/) is available on Git Center.\n\n![Bildschirmfoto_2017-07-14_21-05-02.png (24x24)](data/img/post_3_Bildschirmfoto_2017-07-14_21-05-02.png)\n\nThe clone function should work. But you may prefer to merge it to your present blog:\nBackup your blog first, then edit the `content.json` in your blog root directory and change the `\"cloned_from\": \"...\"` to `\"cloned_from\": \"15mSYzsDxzarssqtV1pFPKqoCTaLdjVB2f\"` and sign your site, then go to ZeroHello, from the site option (click the 3-dot button near your blog) and choose `Upgrade code`. That's all.\n\nIf it doesn't work, simply copy all the folders and files except `content.json` and `data` folder in the root directory of your blog (which contains your blog data and user comments). Finally from the config panel (drag the \"0\" button to left to open it), sign and publish your new blog, reload and rebuild your database. You may also need to restart your web browser to refresh the css code.\n\n## Bugs and Troubleshootings:\n\n[Fixed] There's a little random chance that tags will duplicate themselves... It's bug that already exists in the original version. The author even places the relative code on the top of the js file:\n\n```\n//I don't know how to write this function as coffee script\n//it's been called at two place and I don't know how to use\n//-> => @ correctly\nfunction tagToHtml(tag){\n  if (typeof tag === 'string'){\n    //input parameter must not empty nor have duplicate\n    tag = tag.split(\" \");\n  }\n\n  if (tag.length==0) {\n    return \"<a href='?Toc=tagNone'>not tagged</a>\";    \n  }\n  var ret = \"\";\n\n  for (i in tag){\n    value = tag[i]\n    ret+=(\"<a href='?Toc=tag:\"+encodeURIComponent(value)+\"'>\"+value+\"</a> \");\n  }\n  return ret;\n}\n```\n\nReload the page solves the problem.\nHope you enjoy it ;)"

			"body": "[220218] Fix text getting hidden in Markdown mode.\n[110218] Fix scrollbar returning to top when editing in Markdown mode in single post page.\n[060218] Add banner on the left panel, idea from [ZeroNet logo and banner](/1C2JhCunGLtvyX56nQ88tcb87WnXspjWN/?Topic:1_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS/Zeronet+logo+and+banner). If you prefer to remove it, simply edit `index.html` and remove the block of code below:\n\n```\n <!-- Banner -->\n <div class=\"banner\" style=\"padding-bottom: 50px;\">\n   <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"banner-link\" href=\"https://github.com/HelloZeroNet\">\n     <img alt=\"ZeroNet banner\" src=\"img/banner-s-dark.png\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n   </a>\n </div>\n <!-- EOF Banner -->\n```\n\n[030218] TOC by Tag can be toggled on left panel now.\n[020218] Small UI fix and improvement. Left panel and footer only show up after the page is loaded, so no more ugly flashy things. Left panel is dim now on single post page, except when cursor is on it.\n[161217] UI improvement, now the width of container (left & right panel) is 960px, and the container will stay in center if the window is wider than 960px.\nAdd dark theme stylesheet, if you want to use it, open `index.html` in the zite root folder and add this line:\n\n```diff\n...\n <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/all.css\" />\n+ <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"dark.css\" />\n...\n```\n\nYou can check [my blog](/1EiMAqhd6sMjPG2tznkkGXxhdwFBDdeqT9) for how it looks like.\n[151117] Rename myZeroBlog to ZeroBlog Plus. Fix pagination bug. [Source code](/1M5dciFFSWt4wKs9Nnxa34BgGnt7os7h3v/) is now available on Git Center.\n[200917] Add quite some UI improvement, tag index is now ordered by post count.\n[080917] Hopefully fix the bug that tag sometimes duplicates itself.\n[240717] Fix Pager (Prev Page, Next Page), fix list and table font size in mobile mode.\n[220717] Fix publish bar in small screen.\n[200717] Add mobile viewport suport, this feature is not upgradable, so if you have cloned this zite, you need to add it manually in `/path/to/zite/content.json`:\n\n```\n{\n...\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n{\n\"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\",\n...\n```\n\nThen sign your blog to take effect.\n[200717] Fix a bug that left panel is not editable in mobile mode."
