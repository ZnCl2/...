But yet I did not found an advice howto proceed :-(\n\nIf you really want to delete your site, and you are sure about its address, i do not know, but i know how to empty it:\n\n1. visit the site, drag & drop its (0) button in the top right corner to show menu. There find the link to \"OPEN SITE DIRECTORY\".\n\n2. Check it is indeed your site files, then delete all these and keep only content.json and index.html.\n\n3. then remove contents of the index.html file\n\n4. go back to your site where you have open its (0) menu, here scroll down and click \"Sign and publish\", it should make your site empty (not deleted) and possibly ready for your other files you want to host.",
