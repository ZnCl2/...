			"body": "Included in this torrent:\n\n* MS-DOS 3.30 OEM Adaptation Kit (source code)\n* MS-DOS 6.0 (source code)\n* DDKs / WDKs stretching from Win 3.11 to Windows 7 (source code)\n* Windows NT 3.5 (source code)\n* Windows NT 4 (source code)\n* Windows 2000 (source code)\n\n* Windows XP SP1 (source code)\n* Windows Server 2003 (build 3790) (source code)\n (file name is 'nt5src.7z')\n\n* Windows CE 3.0 Platform Builder (source code)\n* Windows CE 4.2 Shared Source (source code)\n* Windows CE 5.0 Shared Source (source code)\n* Windows CE 6.0 R3 Shared Source (source code)\n* Windows Embedded Compact 7.0 Shared Source (source code)\n* Windows Embedded Compact 2013 (CE 8.0) Shared Source (source code)\n* Windows 10 Shared Source Kit (source code)\n* Windows Research Kernel 1.2 (source code)\n* Xbox Live (source code)\n  (most recent copyright notice in the code says 2009)\n* Xbox OS (source code)\n  (both the \"Barnabas\" release from 2002, and the leak that happened in May 2020)\n\n***\n\n* 2020-09-24\n\nThis is an update to the previous torrent (2020-09-20), made for the sole reason\nof including the file 'nt5src.7z', which contains Windows XP / Windows Server\n2003 source code. Those who have already downloaded the previous torrent, fear\nnot! This torrent is 99% identical, with the only changes being to the files\n'torrent description.txt', 'md5.db', and the inclusion of this text file and\n'nt5src.7z'. You don't have to re-download the other files. Just remove the old\ntorrent from your torrent client (without deleting the data), rename the\ndirectory from 'Microsoft leaked source code archive_2020-09-20' to 'Microsoft\nleaked source code archive_2020-09-24'. Add the new torrent to your torrent\nclient and force it to do a re-hash / re-check of the files, if it doesn't do it\nautomatically.\n\nThe leak happened on 4chan, and although the file name is the same this file is\nslightly smaller. This is because my file only has one level of compression,\nwhile the original file had CAB files inside the 7zip file. The only change I\nmade was to extract the CABs, and then compress the extracted files with 7zip.\n\nBecause, fuck CABs.\n\nIt's all there. Enjoy",
