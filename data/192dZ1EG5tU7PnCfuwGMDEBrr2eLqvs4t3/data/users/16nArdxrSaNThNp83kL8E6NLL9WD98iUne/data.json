			"body": "Torrent created by Mewtwo75570\n\n##Original Description:##\nThis torrent contains the collection of Pokemon Adventures Manga Volume 1 -40 and Pokemon Black & White Special Chapters 1- 18.... Hope all u guys like it :D  \n\nAll the latest translations are done by Scanlations for /a/nonymous, by /a/nonymous!  \n\nhttp://anonscanlations.blogspot.in/\n\nALL FILES ARE IN \"CBZ\" FORMAT USE APPROPRIATE READER OR CHANGE EXTENSION TO \"RAR\"  \n\n###Pokémon Adventures###\n\nPokémon Adventures (Japanese: ポケットモンスターSPECIAL Pocket Monsters SPECIAL) is a manga series authored by 日下秀憲 Hidenori Kusaka. It was illustrated by 真斗 Mato for the first nine volumes and starting from Volume 10 it has been illustrated by 山本サトシ Satoshi Yamamoto. It is published by Shōgakukan under the Ladybird Comics Special series.  \n\nIt is popularly known as Pokémon Special even outside of Japan, and often shortened as PokéSpe (Japanese: ポケスペ PokeSupe).  \n\nUnlike the anime, which, though drawing much inspiration from the games, does not follow them exactly, Pokémon Adventures is a mostly game-based manga, with the fifteen main characters taking their names from the main series games, and their various adventures tending to stay restricted to their home region. Also unlike the anime, which has gone to great lengths to indicate the danger of a legendary Pokémon being captured, the main characters of Pokémon Adventures have captured and sometimes use their own legendaries, much as the player can in the games. Pokémon Adventures also contains darker elements than other media, including certain characters and some Pokémon actually dying.  \n\nOn October 26, 2009, it was announced that Gakunen magazine Grade 5 and Grade 6 (at the time serializing the Diamond & Pearl chapter) would cease publication at the end of the fiscal year. Publication will continue in the Grade 4 magazine, and in Corocoro Ichiban.  \n\nPokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri is quoted as stating, \"This is the comic that most resembles the world I was trying to convey.\" Game producer Tsunekaz Ishihara also praises the series, saying, \"I want every Pokémon fan to read this comic!\"  \n\n**Story arcs**\t\t\n\n**Red, Green & Blue chapter (Volume 1~3)**  \n\nThe first chapter of Pokémon Adventures, much like the first games, chronicles the journeys of Red and Blue across the Kanto region, conquering its eight Gyms and the Pokémon League. Later, a third Trainer, Green, comes into the plot. Together, the three defeat Team Rocket, an evil organization that uses Pokémon for illegal acts. Red also helps Blaine to capture Mewtwo and saves a young girl from wild Pokémon in Viridian Forest. In the end, as in the games, Red defeats Blue in the Pokémon League.  \n\n**Yellow chapter (Volume 4~7)**  \n\nThe Yellow chapter starts two years after Red obtains his title of the Champion in the Pokémon League. Red disappears for one month after he leaves to answer a challenge from someone named Bruno. One day, Professor Oak discovers Red's Pikachu, Pika, injured at his doorstep. Soon after the arrival of Pika, a young Trainer comes into the Professor's lab. The Trainer, Yellow, claims that \"he\" is a friend of Red and wishes to look for him with Pika. While Professor Oak is still skeptical about Yellow, especially about \"his\" ability of healing and sensing Pokémon's emotions, he eventually entrusts this mission and Red's upgraded Pokédex to the young Trainer. However, this event only triggers the revelation of a larger secret as Yellow is repeatedly attacked by members of the Elite Four. When Yellow discovers that the Elite 4 base is situated at Cerise island, Yellow heads there and meets up with Blaine, Blue, Green and the Team Rocket Commanders: Sabrina, Lt. Surge, and Koga. They decide to team up to take down the Elite 4, where Red also joins them.  \n\n**Gold, Silver & Crystal chapter (Volume 8~15)**  \n\nAs peace is returning to Kanto, new journeys and happenings are beginning in another region, Johto. Gold was enjoying his normal life with his family Pokémon, who have been with him since birth, until he ran into a Pokémon thief at Professor Elm's lab. As he goes on a journey of chasing the thief, Silver, with a Cyndaquil from Professor Elm and Pokédex from Professor Oak, he stumbles upon the secret plots of the Masked Man. At the same time, Professor Oak sends out a \"Pokémon Capture Professional,\" Crystal, on a journey of completing the Pokédex. She gets involved in Eusine's plans to capture Suicune and tries to do so herself. Soon after, she also gets involved with the plots of Masked Man, who is apparently after the two legendary Pokémon, Lugia and Ho-Oh. The more shocking revelation follows: this Masked Man is actually one of the 8 Gym Leaders of the Johto area!  \n\n**Ruby & Sapphire chapter (Volume 15~22)**  \n\nThings have just settled down in Kanto and Johto, but another new region comes on screen. This chapter is about the \"rivalry\" of Ruby and Sapphire, who are trying to conquer all the Pokémon Contests and Gyms in Hoenn respectively within the span of 80 days. Just like their counterparts in Kanto and Johto, they encounter two evil organizations, the land-loving Team Magma and sea-loving Team Aqua. Team Aqua steals the Heart component from Mr. Stone, President of Devon Corporation while Team Magma steals the Kaien I. Team Aqua destroys the volcano using the Grand Meteor, disrupting the balance of nature. Sapphire picks up a piece of the Grand Meteor and keeps it, but not for long, as soon she and Ruby clash with the leaders Maxie and Archie as the two new Pokédex Holders attempt to quell the two titans Groudon and Kyogre!  \n\n**FireRed & LeafGreen chapter (Volume 22~26)**  \n\nThe FRLG series continues the series featuring the characters Red and Blue as they are forced to explore the Sevii Islands to look for Professor Oak who has been kidnapped by Team Rocket. Meanwhile, Green has finally located her parents, but as she is about to meet them, they get swallowed up by a mysterious black hole after a Deoxys attacks them. Red, Green, and Blue must locate the missing relatives with the help of former foe Lorelei, the psychic mutant Mewtwo and a mysterious old lady, Kimberly, while defeating Team Rocket again at the same time. Back in Kanto, Silver is seeking his parents as well, with the help of Yellow. He is soon shocked by the revelation of who his father really is: Giovanni!  \n\n**Emerald chapter (Volume 26~29)**  \n\nThe grand opening of the Battle Frontier takes an unexpected twist when Emerald appears on the scene. Now he must conquer the seven facilities in seven days. With a seemingly unmatched ability at battles and access to every Pokémon Crystal has ever caught, the mysterious stranger that attacks Noland and is seeking Jirachi, Guile Hideout, may be more of a worry, especially if he catches Jirachi first...  \n\n**Diamond & Pearl chapter (Volume 30~38)**  \n\nAn important family from the region of Sinnoh sends their latest descendant Platinum on a special mission with two bodyguards. Platinum instead meets with Diamond and Pearl, who coincidentally match the description given to her (two boys in scarves, one in red, the other in green). They join her, believing she is the tour guide of a trip to Mt. Coronet they won as a prize in a comedy contest. But these misunderstandings mark the start of their Pokémon journeys.  \n\n**Platinum chapter (Volume 38~40)**  \n\nThis chapter follows Lady Platinum Berlitz as she enters the Battle Frontier to gather information on the mysterious Distortion World so she can rescue two very important people. Joining Platinum is Looker, member of the International Police, who aims to investigate the villainous Team Galactic.  \nMeanwhile, Diamond and Pearl set off with Sinnoh Pokémon Association Chairman and Dr. Footstep to find the Legendary and Rare Pokémon of Sinnoh using Charon's stolen notebook on Legendary Pokémon.  \n\n**Black & White chapter (Volume ?~?)**  \n\nThis latest chapter follows Black's journey across the Unova region, with the dream of conquering the Pokémon League and become the Pokémon Champion. He is joined by White, who runs the BW Agency and whose dream is to raise the best Pokémon actor out there.",

A dynamic cast of characters and it sticks more closely to the games, making for a far more interesting story than the episodic style of the anime.
