			"body": "Rogue System's goal is to depict the possibilities of space exploration and combat within a realistic environment--choosing not to ignore the \"science\" in science-fiction. Key features do/will include proper orbital mechanics for all objects in space; detailed ship system control, functionality, inter-dependency and damage reaction; and the ability to move freely from one ship to another, EVA, and effect repairs while in flight.\n\nRogue System’s Core Module (CM) will be a complete campaign-driven sim on its own. It utilizes both dynamic as well as scripted missions to allow for greater replay-ability while telling an intriguing story.\n\nFinally, Rogue System is fully moddable, allowing both DCI as well as the sim’s community to add new ships, missions, and even campaigns.\n\nLater, Extension Modules (EM) will add even more gameplay.\n\n[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/366000/Rogue_System/)\nSource (ru): https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5579243",
