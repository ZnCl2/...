This game works ONLY on Windows 10 x64, build 1607 or later. I also recommend you to install Windows Store, Xbox and Xbox Identity applications for crack to work. Also virtualization (Hyper-V Support) must be set off either in OS settings and/or in BIOS. If the setup won’t turn on Developer Mode on your OS, turn it on manually\n  - Windows virtualization (Hyper-V Support) must be set off either in OS settings and/or in BIOS\n  - Developer Mode must be turned on your OS. My installer tries to turn it on automatically, but if fails, make sure to turn it on manually\n  - If you don’t uncheck the option in the installer, the crack will automatically apply after final files verification\n  - If you unckecked the option, you must run the crack manually from the desktop icon\n  - After the crack applied, FH3 will appear on your Start Menu – you can drag the game to desktop and make a shortcut icon\n  - If the crack still doesn’t work – something is off with reqirements listed above: Windows version, dev.mode, etc.\n  - Upon the first launch the game will ask you for folder to keep saves in. You either create a new subfolder, like “FH3” or use any existing folder\n\n### Selective Download\n\nYou can skip downloading 4K videos and voicepacks you don’t need. Here is the list of selective/optional files. You MUST download at least one of speech packs\n\n  - fg-optional-4k-videos.bin\n  - fg-selective-speech-english.bin\n  - fg-selective-speech-brazilian.bin\n  - fg-selective-speech-french.bin\n  - fg-selective-speech-german.bin\n  - fg-selective-speech-spanish.bin\n\nIn example, if you want to launch the game with Spanish voiceovers – skip all “selective” and “optional” files, but download fg-selective-speech-spanish.bin & all main (01-07) files.",
