			"body": "Windows Loader v2.2.2\nThe safe and easy way to activate Windows.\n\nâ€‹\n\nAbout\n\nThis is the loader application that's used by millions of people worldwide, well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.\n\n\nThe things you might want to know\n\n    It works on 32-bit and 64-bit systems\n    It's compatible with Windows 7 SP1 and all system updates\n    It's compatible with all system languages\n    It can be used to pre-activate Windows\n    It allows you to install custom OEM information\n    It features application integrity checking\n    It supports hidden partitions and some complex setups\n    It can work alongside Linux's GRUB or any other boot manager\n    It works with VMware, VirtualBox and Hyper-V\n    It works with most hard drive encryption software e.g. TrueCrypt or BitLocker\n    It allows you to add your own certificates and serials externally\n    It will install just the certificate and serial for users with an existing SLIC\n    It features automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)\n    It won't modify any system files\n    It runs before Windows is launched\n    No extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM\n    All key parts of the loader are encrypted with a custom encryption\n    Every user has a unique version of the loader installed on his or her system\n\n\nSupported operating systems\n\n    Windows 7 Ultimate\n    Windows 7 Ultimate E\n    Windows 7 Professional\n    Windows 7 Professional E\n    Windows 7 Home Premium\n    Windows 7 Home Premium E\n    Windows 7 Home Basic\n    Windows 7 Starter\n    Windows 7 Starter E\n    Windows Vista Ultimate\n    Windows Vista Business\n    Windows Vista Business N\n    Windows Vista Home Premium\n    Windows Vista Home Basic\n    Windows Vista Home Basic N\n    Windows Vista Starter\n    Windows Server 2008 Enterprise\n    Windows Server 2008 Enterprise (Without Hyper-V)\n    Windows Server 2008 Foundation\n    Windows Server 2008 Standard\n    Windows Small Business Server 2008\n    Windows Storage Server 2008 Standard\n    Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 Essentials\n    Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise\n    Windows Server 2008 R2 Foundation\n    Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard\n    Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter\n    Windows Small Business Server 2011 Standard\n    Windows Small Business Server 2011 Essentials\n    Windows Home Server 2011\n    Windows Server 2012 Standard\n    Windows Server 2012 Essentials\n    Windows Server 2012 Foundation\n    Windows Server 2012 Datacenter\n    Windows Storage Server 2012 Standard\n    Windows Storage Server 2012 Workgroup\n    Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 Standard\n    Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 Premium\n    Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard\n\n\nApplication integrity checking?\n\nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.\n\nEven if the icon is green it's still worth checking that the applications path is the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the applications MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n\nDownload\n\n    Magnet link #1\n    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:37041ba60196e8eff7050a801ebe73cedb8c0748&dn=Windows%20Loader%20v2.2.2&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.opentrackr.org%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.zer0day.to%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fexplodie.org%3a6969\n    Magnet link #2 (alternative)\n    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:828362a97556f09baceaafa2063f009be5afa2ef&dn=Windows%20Loader%20v2.2.2-Daz&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.opentrackr.org%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.zer0day.to%3a1337&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3a6969&tr=udp%3a%2f%2fexplodie.org%3a6969\n\nYou'll need to use a torrent client to download Windows Loader (e.g. qBittorrent or Transmission).\n\n\n\nCHANGELOG\n\nVersion 2.2.2 (04/02/2014)\n* Added support for Windows Server 2012 R2 operating systems\n* Added a valid OEM SLP key for Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard (it was taken from a Dell server)\n* Added a warning for virtual machines created in VirtualBox that are using Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2 (use ICH9 for the loader to work)\n* Allowed the loader to be installed onto Xen again (if it doesn't work for you then it can't be fixed)\n* Added lots of new keys, SLIC's and certificates\n* Cleaned up the UI\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.2.1 (01/29/2013)\n* Added a new GRLDR\n* Redesigned the advanced options tab and added an option to relocate the RSDP to the EBDA\n* Added Seneca and Twinhead Windows 7 Professional keys\n* Added BenQ Windows 7 Home Premium key\n* Added Seneca SLIC and certificate\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.2 (12/28/2012)\n* Fixed Xen detection\n* Fixed a small issue with some decoded keys\n* Pressing the delete key will now remove the OEM picture\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.1.9 (12/23/2012)\n* Added a new GRLDR\n* Blocked the loader from installing onto Xen as it's not supported\n* Added notes about Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 to the read me file\n\nVersion 2.1.8 (12/15/2012)\n* Added a new GRLDR (required to support Server 2012 operating systems)\n* Added support for Windows Server 2012 Standard, Essentials, Foundation & Datacenter\n* Added support for Windows Storage Server 2012 Standard & Workgroup\n* Added support for Windows MultiPoint Server 2012 Standard & Premium\n* Added HEDY Windows 7 Ultimate key\n* Added ByteSpeed, DakTech, Genuine C&C, INSYS, WIPRO & Zoostorm Windows 7 Professional keys\n* Added ByteSpeed & INSYS Windows 7 Home Premium keys\n* Added AOC & ByteSpeed Windows 7 Starter keys\n* Added AOC, ByteSpeed, EXTRA Computer GmbH, Mustek, Velocity and Western Digital v2.1 SLIC's and certificates\n* Added a Dell v2.2 SLIC to activate 2012 server editions (only recommended for Server 2012 unless you're dual booting with Windows 7/Vista)\n* Added new launch parameters\n* Fixed a Windows key decoding bug\n* Fixed the \"Licensed\" text color for BIOS activated systems\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVersion 2.1.7 (07/19/2012)\n* Fixed a bug that was causing the RSDT to get trashed\n\nVersion 2.1.6 (07/19/2012)\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Fixed a Hyper-V installation issue\n* Added Tangent Professional serial\n* Added Dealin Starter serial\n\n\nEXE MD5: 323c0fd51071400b51eedb1be90a8188\nEXE SHA-1: 0efc35935957c25193bbe9a83ab6caa25a487ada\n\n\n\nAll credits to Daz for this amazing tool.",
