In my opinion every file you could ever possibly need should be available via torrent. I used an APK actually to install on a friends Nexus 7 tablet. Google play wouldn't allow him to install it for some reason, so we did it manually and he just connected the tablet to a mobile hotspot. And the more torrents we have on here (even if a google search or two could find them as well) the better it is for the site in general.",
