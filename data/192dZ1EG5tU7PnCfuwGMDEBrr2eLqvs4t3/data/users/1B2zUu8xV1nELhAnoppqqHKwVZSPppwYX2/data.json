			"body": "Taken from GOG site:\n\nKenshi is an open world, squad based sandbox RPG set in a brutal sword-punk wasteland. Gameplay is open-ended rather than a linear story, so you can play as a settler, a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave... or just food for the cannibals. \n\nBut first things first, you need to survive. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors, carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. You are not the chosen one, you’re not great and powerful, you don’t have more ‘hitpoints’ than everyone else and you are not special. Unless you work for it.\n\nCustomise a solo character or a whole squad and train them from puny victims to master warriors\n\nSurvive in an unrelenting world of slavers, cannibals, wild beasts and famine. Nowhere is safe.\n\nBuild your own fortress, research technologies, craft your own gear and wage war with other factions\n\nExplore and scavenge the uncharted lands of one of the largest single player open world maps to date\n\nAbsolutely no level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you and the game won't hold your hand.\n\nIt's an I2P torrent, but the tracker didn't work well for me, so I'm posting it here.",
