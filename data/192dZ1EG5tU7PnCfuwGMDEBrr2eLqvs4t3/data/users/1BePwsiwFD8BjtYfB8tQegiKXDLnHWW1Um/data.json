			"body": "Great Soviet Era film. An old torrent I was able to recover from KAT. Original torrent not by me.\n\nBased on the novel \"Roadside Picnic\". Stalker is considered by some to be one of the greatest films of all time. Quite unlike the video game series it inspired: S.T.A.L.K.E.R., the film focuses on a more subtle zone.\n\nThere exists an area in the country where the laws of nature do not apply. This area has been abandoned and cordoned off by government forces. The story focuses on a stalker -one who intricately knows the zone, and may have a connection of sorts with it- agrees to take a scientist and a writer into the center of the zone. To a room that is said to grant the wishes of any man who enters it. The film focuses on these characters and their reasons for attempting to reach the room.\n\nThis film is a unique experience. It is a very subtle film in comparison to modern cinema. This greatly focuses on the characters themselves and the somewhat unexplained symbolism at times can confuse or bore viewers who prefer more action packed flicks. Think 2001, a Russia odyssey. If you are ready for a philosophical journey of sorts though, you're in for a treat. Shrooms may enhace the experience to unheard of mindfuck levels and you may wake up in a field in Ukraine with nothing but a bottle of vodka and some rusty bolts.\n\nLang: Russian\nSub: English, French, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish\nTitle: Stalker\nYear:1979\nResolution: 720p\nFormat: MKV\nSize: 1.20GB",
