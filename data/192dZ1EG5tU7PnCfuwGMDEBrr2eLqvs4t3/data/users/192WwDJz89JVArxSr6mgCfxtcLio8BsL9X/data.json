			"body": "Rust is a 2013 multiplayer action-adventure survival game created by Facepunch Studios, the creators of Garry's Mod. The game is like DayZ, but no zombies. You have to do anything to survive. Craft weapons, kill animals, chopping trees and create houses. You also have to avoid bears and wolves at night, starvation, drowning, or the exposure of radiation at day. Fight with other players as they will try to hunt you down and kill you. You can also live as a nomad if you are a solo survival that have many good weapons with ammo. \nCan you survive in this challenging and dangerous game ever?\nFind out in \"RUST\".",
