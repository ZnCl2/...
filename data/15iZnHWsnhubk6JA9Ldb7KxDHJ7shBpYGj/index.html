<h4>HA6AN and 109HA1495 - OP Norbert</h4>
<h3>About me</h3><br/>
<h1>I'm a 20 years old tech enthusiast from Hungary,Törökbálint(10kms away from Budapest).I got my callsing in the summer of 2015,and I got my first PMR radio when I was only 9 years old.Since then,I'm fully obsessed with the topic :D</h1><br/>
<h3>My interests in ham radio</h3><br/>
<h1>My main interests in ham radio topics include chasing DX on the HF bands in SSB and digital weak signal(mostly JT-65 and JT-9) modes,and using special propagation anomalies to make contacts.For example,I had a lot of success with TEP(transequatorial propagation) in JT-65 between 10 and 15meters. <br/>Also,in last couple of months I enjoyed FM qsos on the 11m CB band.</h1><br/>
<h3>QTH and the rig</h3><br/>
<h1>As I mentioned,the main QTH is in Törökbálint,Hungary.This is a small town not so far from the capital city,Budapest. <br/>Right now I have a Yaesu FT-757GXII with a 32A switching power supply.For antenna I got a 30meters long longwire(or random wire,dependig on wavelenght,hi) in the garden,at about 7-8m above the ground.One end is attached to the house,where I'm feeding it with a twin-lead.The other one is attached to a pole on the street.In the other end of the twin-lead,I'm matching the antenna with a homemade tuner designed to be able to match very high impedance cases.With this setup,I'm able to be a reasonable station between 10-80meters. <br/>For UHF and VHF I only have a wouxun KG-UDV1P,I'm not really active on those bands.</h1><br/>
<h3>Future uprgade plans</h3><br/>
<h1>In the future I'm planning to put out a full-size 160m skywire loop,as I really want to get on air there also.Besides that,it should be a very good antenna on 80-40meters,maybe down to 20m.Of course,some kind of beam is also on my list for 10-17meters,but this is a littlebit problematic due to the fact I don't have any towers yet.<br/></h1>
<h3>If you want to meet me on the air :)</h3><br/>
<h1>In the past times,I'm quite active on weak signal modes,I speak a littlebit less on phone modes.I don't have any specific bands,I stay where the propagation does ;) Anyway,mostly I'm active on 10-12-15-17-40-80meters.Unfortunately my tuner cannot handle 30m,and to many people's surpise,I don't really like 20m.It is way too crowded for me,I never had any success there. <br/>So to cut the long story short,feel free to give me a call whenever you see/hear me :) Here's a link to my pskreporter page,you can see here if I'm online: <a href="https://pskreporter.info/pskmap.html?preset&callsign=HA6AN&timerange=86400">HA6AN spots on PSKReporter</a><br/>
Also,if you are relatively near to my qth,and wanna have a friendly chat on the air,or try out an experiment,feel free to contact and add me on my facebook profile.I appriciate any new friendship: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ha6an.joczo">Norbert HA6AN on facebook</a></h1>
