They manipulate the political landscape to consolidate power into their own hands. It doesn't matter how the landscape is configured. That is akin to designing a motocross track.\n\n![motorcross.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_116_motorcross.jpeg)\n\nCreating 'obstacles' to clear only makes the process more complex and challenging to navigate, but the 'obstacles' can and will be overcome. Believing that manufactured 'obstacles' like Constitutions, separation of powers etc. will effectively prevent a good 'rider' from doing whatever he likes is a dangerous delusion. The most successful Statists, like Putin, become anarchists in fact. They can do whatever they like. However, they are not political anarchists. Why would the best riders not believe in the 'track' and 'race' configuration that works best for them? People who can do whatever they like are not a large scale problem unless they command hordes of mindless, obedient, heavily armed followers\n\n![russian_soldier_parade.jpeg (275x184)](data/img/post_116_russian_soldier_parade.jpeg)\n\nThe problem with Putin as anarchist in fact is that he's the only one. Clawing back anarchy for the rest of us just became that little bit harder today.\n\nWith due respect to courageous people like [Alexey Navalny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u6XTUvaDBM) making cosmetic changes to the landscape (amending the Constitution, founding a political party etc.), will make little difference. What kind of 'track' do I propose as an alternative? A flat one that allows everyone to 'race' as efficiently as they are freely able to. A free market, free consensus track, with no taxation (the lifeblood of the State) and no nation states. It wouldn't be perfect, it's still a 'race', but at least it would be devoid of the distracting pretense that somehow bumps and jumps will slow down the best.\n\n![formula_1.jpeg (270x186)](data/img/post_116_formula_1.jpeg)\n\nThe _essential_ point however is that you wouldn't be _forced_ to be a member of _someone else's_ pit crew\n\n![formula_1_pitstop.jpeg (289x174)](data/img/post_116_formula_1_pitstop.jpeg)\n\nEveryone wants to relate to and enjoy the sensation of 'winning' and 'success'\n\n![formula_1_podium.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_116_formula_1_podium.jpeg)\n\nand in sport that may appear relatively harmless.

			"body": "Original:\n[Malta officials resign in broadening scandal over journalist's murder](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-daphne/malta-officials-resign-in-broadening-scandal-over-journalists-murder-idUKKBN1Y00X7?rpc=401&)\n\nMurder. The intentional killing of another. The most serious of all crimes. It should be that simple. We live in a Statist world, so it's not. In the Statist world I have to qualify the statement with 'depending on what costume you happen to be wearing'. The State ascribes to itself the 'Right' to intentionally kill. The voting process facilitates this and is part of why voting is immoral. The irresponsible [handing over of 'Rights' that people do not posses in the first instance](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/el-salvador-upholds-30-year-sentence-stillbirth-case-171215104626774.html).\n\nControl the protection rackets by making your own choices about who's services you pay for. Find this one morally repugnant? Switch your subscription to another. Not your vote, the stuff that actually matters in an un-brainwashed world, the money. There are very few _immoral_ enforcers out there who will do their dirty work without pay. It would bring clarity and alter the nature of debate. Would you choose to pay for a security service and then spend your time shouting 'fascist' at it?\n\n![shouting_fascist.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_115_shouting_fascist.jpeg)\n\nYou're choices won't be ideal or perfect in every respect and you won't agree with others choices entirely either. But they will be your choices which means you cannot escape responsibility for them by bleating on about 'politicians'. _You_ are the politician. In a free world, you control the purse strings.\n\n![purse_strings.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_115_purse_strings.jpeg)\n\nFor the inevitable (entirely understandable and legitimate) counters to this perspective please see [David Friedman The Machinery of Freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYkdEU_B4o)\n\nFor now I suggest suspending, for a moment at least, the reflex we are taught from birth that tells us that as soon as there isn't a 'higher authority' dictating what's best for us, our world will descend into chaos.\n\nI digress you may think. However the above, in my experience, touches on some very deeply held beliefs that are difficult to confront over a significant period of time (more often than not, lifetimes). This is the problem with commenting on news-pieces from day to day. Statists in the mainstream media (MM) are fond of this approach for the obvious reason that it can be used to avoid asking deeper questions about the nature of the State. However, the other side of that coin is that daily news stories can create a useful framework for discussing less popular perspectives as well. It's a question of interpretation.\n\n![interpretation.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_115_interpretation.jpeg)\n\nThis story helps us to put the process, of exchanging one set of Statists who commit murder behind the scenes with another set who shout 'mafia' at them today and continue to extort in the name of the State tomorrow, into context. If you chose the security services investigating this heinous crime through your own pocket your personnel would be motivated to find and detain those involved who you could then expose to a system of justice that you also had _chosen_ to subscribe to (not one organized and financed by the Statist Mafia). If you feel insecure about your personal purchasing power you might reflect for a moment on how much of your income is currently extorted from you in all the forms of taxation (not just income tax). Just a sample:\n\n![direct-indirect_tax.jpeg (238x212)](data/img/post_115_direct-indirect_tax.jpeg)\n\nFreed from the presumption that someone else knows best how you should spend your hard earned money, you can make choices regarding those services that you _genuinely_ believe in. I may choose to subscribe to a service that fully investigated and prosecuted this case so that Daphne Caruana Galizia did not die in vain. You may disagree with my choice. That's what being an individual is all about. That's one reason why an individual life is precious. Of course the 'Mafia' will kill people who tell the Truth. They've been doing it since the beginning of time. The question is what are you (and I) going to do about it?\n\n![what_are_you_going_to_do_about_it.jpeg (194x259)](data/img/post_115_what_are_you_going_to_do_about_it.jpeg)\nor should we let the State decide for us?\n\nIt's the idea that Ms. Galizia represented that cannot be killed. Speaking Truth to power. She will forever have lived a life of tremendous meaning even whilst having tragically confronted death at a relatively early age.\n\n![daphne_caruana_galizia.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_115_daphne_caruana_galizia.jpeg)\n\nShe inspires me to write, no matter what the Mafia (costumed or otherwise) and it's apologists do, because they will never understand that you can't cage or blow up an idea like freedom, even if you have all the power and resources in the world\n\n![julian_assange.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_115_julian_assange.jpeg)\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small><small>`45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`</small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

			"body": "Original:\n[Uber's licence in London not extended](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/ubers-licence-in-london-not-extended)\n\nThe mainstream media (MM), to which this blog is an antidote, loves to hone in on and sensationalize any story it can that promotes the idea that without the State all our worlds would descend into an unmanageable, unworkable cauldron of inefficiency, inconvenience and danger.\n\n![something_must_be_done.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_114_something_must_be_done.jpeg)\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact that we are all forced at gunpoint to pay tribune to our masters, the argument goes, we'd all be raping, pillaging and cheating our way through life in such a way that the quality of life for us all would degenerate beyond repair.\n\n![the_purge.jpeg (284x177)](data/img/post_114_the_purge.jpeg)\n\nPut simply, we need to be told what's good for us, by people who know better (politicians compete to convince us that they are, indeed, that person).\n\n![jo_swinson.jpeg (292x173)](data/img/post_114_jo_swinson.jpeg)\n\nIf the appeals fail in 21 days the lives of tens of thousands of people in London will change for the worse. No matter how good/bad the actual Uber experience is in London everyone had a choice, based on their own personal assessment of their own circumstances and their tolerance for risk.\n\nAs choices get snuffed out so does freedom. Real freedom, the freedom that actually affects the day to day lives of real people. Not the abstract claptrap of campaigning windbags who end up being controlled by the experienced professional mandarins in the background.\n\n![yes_minister.jpeg (280x180)](data/img/post_114_yes_minister.jpeg)\n\nThe format that's usually employed in these circumstances is for isolated cases of unpleasant/criminal incidents to be consistently highlighted in the MM until the 'something must be done' crowd gives the mandarins all the excuses they believe they need to snuff out freedom once again. [In this instance such cases are notable by their absence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/fake-uber-driver-assaults.html) (although I accept they may well exist). This is possible because the 'something must be done' crowd only ever believes that something can be done via the State. This is an understandable but highly regrettable state of affairs. It's understandable because we are all conditioned from birth to appeal to a 'higher authority' to have any impact on the wider world. It's highly regrettable because every time it's done it re-enforces the idea that the only way that anything can ever be managed and improved is via the instruments and institutions of the State.\n\n![govt_aid_application.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_114_govt_aid_application.jpeg)\nThe State itself has no incentive to actually improve anything (which is very different to being forced to manage it's PR - it has to give the impression it does 'good' stuff). The State is only incentivized to extend it's own power, control and funding sources (in this instance fines for 'unlicensed' cab drivers).\n\n![state_power_extension.jpeg (272x186)](data/img/post_114_state_power_extension.jpeg)\n\nI empathize with all those people who, sooner or later, are going to wake up one day to one less option for transport. More sacrifices in countless different ways as a sacrifice to the 'greater good'. Whilst that may mean that people are physically and mentally more drained doing some mundane thing they previously did more easily and conveniently,\n\n![difficult_train_travel.jpeg (292x173)](data/img/post_114_difficult_train_travel.jpeg)\n\nthe real damage has been done at the political level. Despite all the blustering about how important 'ordinary people' are to the politicians and the sense they convey that 'you matter', the reality is that your opinions, your choices, don't matter at all. The decision has been taken out of your hands. Your only hope is to enter the political election circus where you'll be encouraged to rubber stamp the process that will work against your real interests no matter what the blustering windbags pretend (or even actually do) believe in.\n\n![corbyn_on_bus.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_114_corbyn_on_bus.jpeg)\n\nThis is why voting is one thing that should not be done. Not because there aren't many things, like transportation, that urgently need to be addressed and fixed but because fixing them depends on you, not the State.\n\n![pmd.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_114_pmd.jpeg)\n\nWhen you voluntarily decide to pay for a service that gives you value for money you contribute, in your own small way, to the broader provisioning of that service. If it works for you, maybe it works for others as well. You don't know. You don't need to know. You couldn't possibly know if you wanted to. You probably don't pretend to know either. But then we're not politicians, just 'ordinary' people, trying to bring some order to our lives. The State doesn't like that. Fear, confusion and exhaustion are it's playbook. Please consider that on your next delayed rush hour Tube trip.\n\n![rush_hour_tube.jpeg (318x159)](data/img/post_114_rush_hour_tube.jpeg)\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

			"body": "Original:\n[Web inventor has an ambitious plan to take back the net](https://www.modbee.com/news/business/article237735284.html)\n\nHow can anyone criticize a scientist? Facts are, after all, facts. Scientists only deal with facts, so they can never, ever, be wrong ... about anything.\n\n![never_wrong.jpeg (226x223)](data/img/post_113_never_wrong.jpeg)\n\nNot only that but they are super smart. I thought science O levels were tough and what are they compared to a PhD or a Professorship? Not much ... only a _fool_ would question a scientist.\n\nToday we have not just any old scientist but _Sir_ Tim Berners-Lee (TBL).\n\n![tim_berners_lee.jpeg (201x251)](data/img/post_113_tim_berners_lee.jpeg)\n\nI'm communicating this to you via _his_ invention. What Right do _I_ have to say anything even vaguely derogatory?\n\nFrom a purely scientific perspective all this is true. From a political one it is not.\n\nOne of the most famous scientists with widely influential political views was Bertrand Russell:\n\n![bertrand_russell.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_113_bertrand_russell.jpeg)\n\n\"Occasionally, he advocated preventive nuclear war, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed and he decided he would \"welcome with enthusiasm\" world government. He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I. Later, Russell concluded that war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany was a necessary \"lesser of two evils\" and criticised Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament. (Wiki)\n\nWhat a mess!\n\nPut simply ... scientists are human like the rest of us.\n\nTBL perhaps differs in significant ways from Bertrand Russell in his politics. But his opinion is influential because he's a scientist. Being a better than average scientist doesn't change the equation. Not in politics.\n\nHis well intentioned call to create a “Contract for the Web” plays right into the hands of the politicians, bureaucrats and oligarchs who understand that by framing the debate around 'rights and obligations' for the Internet something originally intended to restrain them can, as usual, be turned on it's head to make the general population sign up to such a 'contract'. After all, we agree to the idea _in principle_, right? He would probably protest at such an outcome (when it's too late). Future generations could look back and cast him as a 'misunderstood genius' who's noble ideas were twisted by 'lesser men' into something oppressive (heard that anywhere else?).\n\n![karl_marx.jpeg (200x252)](data/img/post_113_karl_marx.jpeg)\n\n(Karl Marx)\n\nThat's fine for him, not so good for the rest of us.\n\nThe real mistake he's making is talking to the European Parliament in Brussels in the first instance. Raising the credibility of the Statist behemoth using his name and influence to sell an idea that the professionals in the auditorium know they can twist to their collective advantage.\n\n![european_parliament.jpeg (333x151)](data/img/post_113_european_parliament.jpeg)\n\nWe all know what free speech is and we don't need a 'charter' or any other kind of 'guideline' or 'rule-book' that attempts to define it. We certainly don't need a scientist to tell us what it should or should not be ... I leave that to you ... the _real_ expert ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

Like any technology they are neither 'good' or 'bad'. They may be more or less powerful, but that is besides the point. What matters is who gets to decide how they're used.\n\nIn my experience most people's view on this is similar to their view on many other issues. They have a great deal of confidence in their own judgement to, for example, use a weapon appropriately (ask yourself right now). It is everyone else they are concerned about (ask someone else right now). We can all think of people who's judgement we doubt and for whom we would prefer didn't have access to, for example, powerful weapons.\n\n![fool_with_gun.jpeg (250x202)](data/img/post_112_fool_with_gun.jpeg)\n\nWe are fearful of what they might do. That fear diminishes as confidence in one's own judgement, ability and an accompanying rise in personal access to powerful weapons increases.\n\n![gun_handling.jpeg (275x184)](data/img/post_112_gun_handling.jpeg)\n\nIn other words our ability to handle the aggressor. It is the imbalance of power we fear, not the power itself. The moment you, or the person you empathize with, is back behind the technology and in control, the concerns dissipate. The aggressor has to back off or face the consequences.\n\n![old_lady_mad_max.jpeg (350x144)](data/img/post_112_old_lady_mad_max.jpeg)\n\nThere is one armed aggressor we all live with, all the time. The State. The State enjoys a massive imbalance of power relative to the individual. For this reason, if we are honest, we are correctly fearful of the State. Subject to such an imbalance of power, all the time, it is natural to succumb to [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) and convince ourselves that the State is, in fact, our friend. This helps us to avoid the painful cognitive dissonance of accepting that this is far from so in reality.\n\n![police_violence.jpeg (194x259)](data/img/post_112_police_violence.jpeg)\n\nWe are simply a resource from which the State may feed itself. Despite any objections to this point a Statist will make he will never grant an exception to the plunder for any individual. 'Well, we all _have_ to pay tax', he will say.\n\n![list_of_taxes.jpeg (225x225)](data/img/post_112_list_of_taxes.jpeg)\n\nThis assertion, once the euphemisms are stripped away, is backed up by armed force.\n\n![irs_raid.jpeg (299x168)](data/img/post_112_irs_raid.jpeg)\n\nThis is why the State cannot afford to allow the imbalance to be redressed. As our own confidence, ability and self-awareness increase it's hold over us weakens. Thus, we are subject to endless streams of propaganda that reinforce the State's perspective.\n\n![gun_control_on_tv.jpeg (303x166)](data/img/post_112_gun_control_on_tv.jpeg)\n\nIt's an issue that goes way back (perhaps as far as the beginning of 'civilization' itself)\n\n![WhiskeyRebellion.jpg (500x317)](data/img/post_112_WhiskeyRebellion.jpg)\n\nWhiskey Rebellion of 1791\n\nand really nothing's changed. All the good reasons for not allowing the State to acquire unlimited resources having resoundingly been vindicated\n\n![Endless_war_on_terror.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_112_Endless_war_on_terror.jpeg)\n\nThe endless 'war on terror' is just one example\n\nThis is why stories like this one in the title, in which ordinary people use their power and control by effectively harnessing technology to redress the balance of power, are so rare. Relegated to the more obscure online publications rather than the mainstream news. It doesn't fit the narrative. It tells us that ordinary people are capable of caring for and helping each other when it comes to armed aggression, not just the passive 'do gooding' that the State likes to promote.\n\n![gov_volunteers.png (174x290)](data/img/post_112_gov_volunteers.png)\n\nIf people are prepared to volunteer their services for the benefit of the community, then what exactly is the role of the State? Theoretically every role it provides (including management and co-ordination) could be fulfilled. This is not realistic, of course, but the reality gap is then filled by market forces (although that is, like many economic domains, also highly distorted by the State's plundering process).\n\nFor the record, personally, I believe this woman should have the ability to subscribe to and call a professional security firm to retrieve her car. Those who cannot afford such a service should be free to protect themselves, and their property, however they judge fit.\n\nIn some States, particularly ones with [a notoriously aggressive stand against political dissent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh), simply possessing (without any evidence of harm to another) a firearm attracts grievous bodily harm\n\n![caning_injuries.jpeg (307x164)](data/img/post_112_caning_injuries.jpeg)\n\n(Reportedly (not verified) from Changi Prison)\n\n[and caging for many years from the State](https://www.businessinsider.sg/the-two-men-caught-for-possessing-a-gun-and-ammunition-are-also-suspected-drug-offenders-heres-how-they-were-nabbed/).

No matter what patch of the planet you happen to be residing in. The 'terrible' truth is the only 'leader' that's really worth listening to is _yourself_. Like any wise leader you will consult with experts when you know you don't know, you will be tolerant in your dealings with others and slow to judge. You will only ever respond with violence, never initiate it. You will be concerned with improving your, and those with whom you contract, material circumstances so that everyone benefits without having to subscribe to some, easy to manipulate, notion of collectivism and self-sacrifice.\n\n![kamikazees.jpeg (283x178)](data/img/post_111_kamikazees.jpeg)\n\n[Don't wait your whole life to figure this out.](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1573065/surviving-former-kamikaze-pilots-reject-moves-glorify-their-mission)\n\nThere are far more articulate and persuasive writers and thinkers on this topic than myself, such as Ayn Rand for example (I'm not a 'follower' of Rand, or anyone else). Persuasive is one thing. Armed and dangerous is something else. All the 'mainstream' politicians are armed and dangerous (via their proxy followers in the security services and collection agencies). This is true all over the World.\n\n![police_state_irs.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_111_police_state_irs.jpeg)\n\n(IRS in USA)\n\nSo it is for Morales. Following on like so many before him. Once he had kissed the ring of power he had trouble letting it go.\n\n![ring_of_power.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_111_ring_of_power.jpeg)\n\nI'm slow to judge. As an individual he appears to have many fine qualities. Like most of them he started out with noble, if often misguided, intentions. Socialism, although a great conveyor belt to popularity for politicians, [won't deliver economically over the long term](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Lw-QAHzk4) and, fortunately for Bolivia, he appears to have understood that to a degree.\n\nThe title of the article contains the essence of the problem. The people seek a leader to fill the 'vacuum'. Currently they have the army. The lowest common denominator. Even the army knows it is the political refuge of last resort. I suggest the 'people' fill the 'vacuum' and get on with their lives paying for those services that they, individually, [want and believe in including legal, arbitration and security services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUvGgs4syuE). That would require something of a mindset change. No more searching for 'dear leaders'.\n\nWhatever the OAS (another huge Statist conglomeration) is up to, abdicating responsibility, giving up and hoping for the best will ensure the people of Bolivia get what they deserve. The next aspirant on the list. One who can tell them what to think and how to think it. Good luck, Bolivia - you're going to need it if you keep looking elsewhere for that which is right under your own nose (or between your ears) ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

We all grow up learning to take from our 'overlords', our parents. It is, therefore, a natural and deeply embedded impulse. We also grow up to learn that our parents don't always act entirely in our own interests at all times and that we have to forge our 'own path', based on our own life experience and aspirations. There are tensions and a 'give and take' that everyone can relate to. In times of difficulty and stress there may be a reversion to relying on the parent, that is greater than there would otherwise normally be.\n\nI am, of course, making an analogy with entire States and, in this case, the 'stressed' State of Syria. This analogy can help to understand why, for example, in an entirely separate episode, the Russians refused aid from the UK during the Kursk crisis?\n\n![kursk_sub.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_110_kursk_sub.jpeg)\n\nTo avoid accepting a humiliating dependency.\n\nDynamics that cause rows, arguments, tensions, upsets etc. at a family level can be deadly at the State level. This view will be criticized for being over simplistic, of course. However, it is better to have a reasonable grasp of the overall dynamics than no grasp at all at that level and only a recognition of all the disparate pieces without the slightest clue how they fit together. States would prefer us not to understand the World in this, too easy to grasp, way. They all, to one degree or another, feed off the idea that we need them to 'protect us'. Without that, what are they other than a drain on the economy and an operation that is dangerously motivated to seek out and perpetuate conflict?\n\n![military_parade.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_110_military_parade.jpeg)\n\nAs an overview the analogy holds and it is one of the oldest Statist tricks in the book. Give us your money and then we'll decide what's best for you. You can even pretend you have a choice (voting) if it makes you feel better. This is how the funds are garnered. Consequently the State will go on to wrestle for control of larger areas in the wider World where it uses the same formula. Military force where possible, 'charity and assistance' where necessary (the choices, to a degree, depending on the political disposition of the population within the home State). Anything to create dependency.\n\n![dependency.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_110_dependency.jpeg)\n\n(Let's 'debate' your 'Rights')\n\nIt's within the context of this broad overview that this man died. We're expected to believe that he was simply a 'good guy', doing his best for a humanitarian cause. Looking into the media propaganda value of these activities for Western States helps us to understand that [it is that view which is overly naive and simplistic.](https://www.corbettreport.com/whitehelmets/)\n\nStatists are more straightforward when they perceive doing so to be in their own interests:\n\n'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had accused Le Mesurier of being a former British agent who has “been spotted all around the world, including in the Balkans and the Middle East ... it is not difficult to assume what the British intelligence officer did there.”'\n\n[The Russians, as arch Statists, will be up to tricks of their own as well of course.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/25/russia-africa-development-soviet-union/)\n\n![russian_tricks.jpeg (800x570)](data/img/post_110_russian_tricks.jpeg)\n\nCursory investigation (Wiki) reveals parallel operations to those undertaken by Le Mesurier, his front organization [Mayday Rescue Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday_Rescue_Foundation) and the usual suspects such as USAID.\n\nLike so many before him, he has died in a foreign land in which his State has an 'interest'. He has died for the State and everything it represents. Was it worth it?\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

I have done so because democracy involves the transference of power from ordinary people to their elected representatives. With this transfer goes the the perceived 'Right' of the politicians to direct their followers (many of whom are armed) to enforce the opinions of the voters on the remainder of the population. What is deemed 'representative' is not at all. It is the tyranny of the Mob. It works because it allows the Voter to delude himself that he is somehow an important part of the political process, even when the tyranny is visited upon him, for e.g. when he pays tribune in the form of taxation for 'services' he will never use. As well as the idea that somehow, in this way, he has acquired a 'Right' that he can transfer to the politicians that he otherwise wouldn't have (e.g. to plunder his neighbor according to his beliefs).\n\nThis is a process that has taken place in most countries around the World [with many less than satisfactory outcomes](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/11037173/Why-Western-democracy-can-never-work-in-the-Middle-East.html)\n\n![come_to_democracy.jpeg (248x203)](data/img/post_109_come_to_democracy.jpeg)\n\nIt is a flawed system and idea. It is, however, preferable to those systems that preceded it and some that still persist in many parts of the World today. It is preferable to the raw, unmitigated tyranny of the gun, that is wielded by an even more unrepresentative group of Statists. Would I critique Morales on his Statist credentials? Of course. Is an elitist coup the answer? Of course not. Swapping out one set of self-righteous, power grabbing politicians with another isn't progress.\n\n![military-coup-in-egypt.gif (2400x1783)](data/img/post_109_military-coup-in-egypt.gif)\n\n(From Mubarak to SCAF)\n\nThe issue of election rigging (e.g. in Bolivia) is a problem of democracy. No elections, no election rigging problem. Use your own wallet to consistently support/not support those things you agree/disagree with. If you are poor you are motivated to understand the World more fully and become more politically active so that you can persuade and combine with others to make your economic power more significant. Avoid supporting Statists at every turn. No money, no Statist. Naive? Then please suggest a 'solution' that doesn't involve making decisions on behalf of others 'for their own benefit'.\n\n![leading_others.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_109_leading_others.jpeg)\n\nUnlike Statists such as Jeremy Corbyn, you are not obligated to take sides in, yet another, false dichotomy (choice). I suggest choosing 'None of the above' and considering ways to then avoid the inevitable Statist backlash. Every Statist hates a 'non-believer'.\n\n![Anwar_al-Awlaki.jpg (440x586)](data/img/post_109_Anwar_al-Awlaki.jpg)\n\nAnwar al-Awlaki\n\nTo clarify, I'm not a Muslim.

However, I respond to the story as told since that's how it reaches public consciousness. If the publisher in question objects then their stories should include all the relevant details. Otherwise I suggest we all need more fully researched publications. For now, this is what we have.\n\nThere are glaring omissions from this bizarre story. Why didn't the 'enslaved black man' simply walk out the front door? This is what the 'vulnerable person' had to say: \"I want him to go to prison, and I want to be there when he go,\". So he was quite capable of appreciating what was being done to him. How many years did this abuse go on for? Was it more than 10?\n\n![glaring_questions.jpeg (242x208)](data/img/post_108_glaring_questions.jpeg)\n\nOne thing is immediately apparent. The line between actual physical violence and 'other coercive means' is quickly blurred as usual. This is important to anyone who wishes to perpetrate injustice. Initiating physical aggression against another can rarely, if ever, be easily justified. However, after that, anything else opens up endless debate about various emotional states and whether they constitute provocation, 'slavery' etc. If it could be proved with reliable evidence that this white man physically assaulted his employee, such as to cause physical injury, then any system of justice, Agorist or otherwise, may well step in to right the wrongs. Under the Statist system that would usually involve an assault charge attracting a prison sentence of less than a year, if at all, and a fine. A similar, such outcome may well occur under a _privately, voluntarily contracted,_ system of justice enforcement in an Agora.\n\nSo where is the justification for the other 9 years prison time? All that's left once the violence has been accounted for is 'emotional abuse whenever the victim made a mistake or failed to work fast enough'. On that basis almost any employer and teacher in the country, at one time or another, would have committed this 'heinous' crime. Should they all be locked up too?\n\n![gordon_ramsay.jpeg (294x171)](data/img/post_108_gordon_ramsay.jpeg)\n\nLet's be clear. Going to prison is far more akin to 'slavery' than anything this white man could have dreamt up for his employee. There a clues, like armed guards, walls and an entire system waiting to ensure that no-one escapes.\n\n![prison_slavery.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_108_prison_slavery.jpeg)\n\nWhere is the evidence for any of these things in this case? When sentences are out of all proportion to the 'crimes' committed the first question to ask is if it's politically motivated. As is apparent from the comments section of the title article 'divide and conquer' is effectively working on the minds of all. White vs Black is an old favorite. Whilst we're all focused on those hackneyed old debates that some of the [more intelligent black commentators like Walter Williams are also getting tired of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZGvQcxoAPg), the principle of politically motivated (in)justice is quietly being perpetrated on us all, with the 'People' exclaiming their approval (again read the comments).\n\nConsider an exuberant black business owner who happened to behave similarly towards a 'vulnerable' young, white employee? 'Justice for all' would demand that he too receive 10 years for 'white slavery'. It won't happen today, or tomorrow, but one fine day, when we're all truly 'emancipated', 'justice' will be completely color blind.\n\nThe State has an instinct for pressing home the advantage as the comments from it's enforcers make clear. Quoting history about which they have no real clue and hypocritical self-righteousness in the pursuit of their tax payer funded careers.\n\n![join_police.jpeg (243x208)](data/img/post_108_join_police.jpeg)\n\nStatist education systems ensure that most citizens have no real appreciation of the principles embodied in their own Constitutions, to the extent, as Lysander Spooner understood a long time ago, that it becomes worse than useless as a mechanism for protecting genuine Rights (it turns out, only _we_ can do that). Perhaps it was the real slavery that we all live under that confused this 'vulnerable' black man into not fully appreciating how outrageous his employer's behavior was and simply walking.\n\n![i_quit.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_108_i_quit.jpeg)\n\nWhen these Federal agents (or agents of any State) extort value from you in the form of tribune they are turning a part of your productive life into slavery, to the State. 100% tax is 100% slavery. 0.00001% tax is 0.00001% slavery. Slavery is wrong in principle. People have generally been so confused about this that it is possible for these agents to attempt to gaslight us by declaring that it is they who fight to save us all against 'slavery', when it is, in fact, they who are the enforcers (the whip wielders) for the true slave masters (their masters) sitting at the top of the 'plantation'.\n\nSlave management has changed a little in form\n\n![slave_management.jpeg (262x193)](data/img/post_108_slave_management.jpeg)\n\nbut not in substance\n\n![police_use_batons.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_108_police_use_batons.jpeg)\n\nIt could hardly be more perverse. Which is one of the underlying reasons for the ridiculous prison sentences that are being meted out to black, white (and, in fact, all) [who don't conform to the State's all pervading strictures all over the World]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQQ9xOhuFrk]).\n\nToday they whip this white man. Tomorrow there will be plenty of black men to whip as well. [Nothing's changed on the 'plantation'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb8Rj5xkDPk).\n\nThey hope to create enough fear, desperation and confusion among the 'vulnerable' slaves that they turn on each other in righteous indignation instead of standing back and understanding how we're all being played and undermined by these dynamics.\n\n![divide_and_conquer.jpeg (220x229)](data/img/post_108_divide_and_conquer.jpeg)\n\nLike this 'vulnerable' black man, I suggest we all learn how to recognize the slavery in our own, State created, minds. Then we can come to the obvious conclusion - just walk away ...\n\n![walk_away2.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_108_walk_away2.jpeg)\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

Anyone who thinks, rather than just avoid cognitive dissonance, has to consider that the highly connected Epstein's death was convenient to say the least. It opens up the possibility that we live in a World in which influential, intelligent and powerful people have to consider the needs of their blackmailers before anything else. The implications of this are legion. Every time a decision at the highest levels is made, that no-one wants or believes in, that inexplicably comes about despite every measure of common sense and reason standing in direct contrast to its manifestation, we have to ask ... how can it be so?\n\n![iraq_war_lies.jpeg (279x180)](data/img/post_107_iraq_war_lies.jpeg)\n\nMaybe it's so, for the same reasons it has always been so. When humanity pretends it functions at a 'higher' moral level and sets a bar so high no-one can actually attain it without living a miserable existence, it creates a perfect environment for hierarchy, and then the blackmail to back it up.\n\n![pope_and_orthodox.jpeg (277x182)](data/img/post_107_pope_and_orthodox.jpeg)\n\nI'm not arguing for 'immorality', but rather the morality that comes from within, not dictated by the outside world. Setting one's own standards, according to one's own 'morality'. Only you can know what that is. Like everything else, if you know you don't know by all means consult an expert. The key is that you remain in charge of the process. _You_ hire the expert, never allow their 'expertise' to turn it the other way round.\n\n![rev_sun_myung_moon.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_107_rev_sun_myung_moon.jpeg)\n\nIf Epstein and his mob have been up to something I wouldn't be surprised and I'd be pleased to see it exposed, so that much of the hypocrisy and illusions of institutions like the Monarchy can be seen for what they really are - Statist constructs.\n\n![collapsing_house.jpeg (274x184)](data/img/post_107_collapsing_house.jpeg)\n\nHowever, the 'victory', should it ever emerge, would only be Pyrrhic (like a firework). Dramatic and brilliant for a moment and then, what? Establishing that people, whether the 'great and the good' or just the 'ordinary' are not as 'great and good' as blustering politicians, attempting to curry favor for their place in the extortion racket, like to pretend, only gets us to first base. A delusion has been dispelled, the cracks in the foundation have been discovered, because a real 'surveyor' (the general public), finally has a medium to inspect what's actually going on (the Internet); a welcome relief from the mainstream media cowboy contractors:\n\n![cowboy_contractors.jpeg (218x232)](data/img/post_107_cowboy_contractors.jpeg)\n\nWill a 'Revolution' ensue? Are we in the midst of one already? Interesting questions. But a harder one is what will the 'Revolution' look like after the 'Revolution'? It is much better to consider such a question before any such thing takes place. We have history to thank for teaching us what happens if we don't consider this properly.\n\n![russion_revolution.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_107_russion_revolution.jpeg)\n\nInterestingly if you get the answers to this question right, you don't need a 'Revolution' in the 'traditional' sense at all. No storming Parliament or Congress. No historic footage of a 'People's Army' making heroic sacrifices for a 'better future' etc. The 'real Revolution', should it ever arise, will be relatively boring. Uneventful. This is the kind the manipulators really fear. What kind of film would Gaslighting have been if the female protagonist had simply walked out the front door and left him for another man? Not a box office smash.\n\nThe manipulators feed off 'scandal' and 'outrage'. As we've seen, Epstein is expendable. So are many others. The people at the top of the pile (it doesn't matter who it is, if no-one believes in the 'pile') will eject every person below them necessary to maintain their own position. Once enough garbage has been thrown out they will set the new agenda, with a new sense of purpose injected into every 'outraged' citizen. It's a recipe for disaster that every true Statist relishes.\n\n![pol_pot_regime.jpeg (183x275)](data/img/post_107_pol_pot_regime.jpeg)\n\nLet's inspect the cracks, understand the problem and then fix it in a level headed and straightforward way that only ordinary people can.\n\n![foundatoin_repair.jpeg (279x181)](data/img/post_107_foundatoin_repair.jpeg)\n\nBy not hypocritically leveraging on 'outrage', but by seeking, exposing, disseminating and debating, among ourselves, what's going on and what we, individually, are prepared to do about it in terms of withdrawing our consent for the entire process and leading ourselves into the future.\n\n![leave_past.jpeg (262x192)](data/img/post_107_leave_past.jpeg)\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

How many ordinary people are in a position to honestly and realistically question climate science? How many satellites have you launched and experiments have you done at personal expense to 'come to your own conclusions'? Believe it or not I haven't done one experiment. I doubt you have either.

Why would any 'ordinary person' bother unless they were out to prove some preconceived notion?\n\n![amateur_scientist.jpeg (301x168)](data/img/post_106_amateur_scientist.jpeg)\n\nThe vast majority of us, the vast majority of the time, haven't got a clue about the 'science'. As with other major topics like economics and health, in such circumstances, we become vulnerable to manipulation by politicians, especially if were deluding ourselves about what we don't really understand. We are not educated to actually understand economics, health or science. We are educated to obey; and most people are very good at it (not surprisingly since they are highly trained from young).\n\n![children_obey.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_106_children_obey.jpeg)\n\nThe general lack of knowledge on a subject is a problem if the politicians have gotten hold of it like a dog with a bone.\n\n![dog_with_bone.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_106_dog_with_bone.jpeg)\n\nI don't underestimate human capability and intelligence. In our world the rewards for successfully navigating the political process far outweigh those of a life spent in productive labor.\n\nTake your pick:\n\n![blair_wealth_foundations.jpeg (271x186)](data/img/post_106_blair_wealth_foundations.jpeg)\n\nor\n\n![stressed_worker.jpeg (282x179)](data/img/post_106_stressed_worker.jpeg)\n\nTony may be a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of them.\n\nThe benefits of being a part of the extortion racket in your particular geographical area are legion and it will attract intelligent and articulate manipulators from diverse sections of society (with a bias towards the 'upper' echelons).\n\n![boris_elite.jpeg (294x171)](data/img/post_106_boris_elite.jpeg)\n\nWhen you observe the debates on the environment between the competing politicians there will be a subtle underlying, implicit, argument which is \"who are you to question the 'authority' in these matters?\". An intelligent person knows what they don't know and there are a lot of intelligent people who don't know anything about science (including many politicians). When we know we don't know we consult an expert. The issue then is trust, not science.\n\n![trust_science.png (300x168)](data/img/post_106_trust_science.png)\n\nYou may have noticed, I don't trust many mainstream narratives. I believe they serve special interests. But that's just me. You have no reason to trust me other than that, I hope, some of what I've written might resonate to a degree. There is one person you can be sure to trust though, yourself. You may not be 'right' all the time, but you can trust that you will attempt to operate in your own best interests (whether you always present it that way is another issue).\n\nIf you trust yourself and don't simply follow what 'leaders' are telling you and yet you know, honestly, that you don't know, then I suggest you owe it to yourself to gather as wide a spectrum of opinion from the experts as possible. Not just the experts that the political process has thrown up in the form of the UN backed IPCC, but also the ones that are a 'spanner in the works'. 'Irresponsible contrarians' who simply won't bow down to the '97%'.\n\n![chaplain_spanner_in_the_works.jpeg (234x215)](data/img/post_106_chaplain_spanner_in_the_works.jpeg)\n\nBy listening to experts I have dug up (they're not household names like Al Gore or Greta Thunberg) I have come to a conclusion that I trust: there are potential issues with the environment that should be monitored and addressed in measured ways over time without imposing unnecessary economic and/or everyday burdens on people who are already economically disadvantaged (most people). There is no climate emergency that requires drastic action. I trust these scientists more than the Statist's (witting or unwitting) ideological allies:\n\n[Prof Bjorn Lomborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_Lomborg)\n[Prof Richard Lindzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindzen)\n[Dr Judith Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Curry)\n\nExamples of the kinds of hidden costs that climate regulation generates are set out in, all too rare, [articles like this.](https://reason.org/commentary/the-hidden-costs-of-environmental-regulations/)\n\nWhoever writes [Wikipedia has decided to make up your mind for you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial); and here it, eventually, after many equivocations and qualifiers, gives an (incomplete - e.g. excludes Lomborg) [list of 'deniers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientists_who_disagree_with_the_scientific_consensus_on_global_warming)\n\nLike any good propaganda vehicle Wikipedia can be a great resource (for those who _already_ know what to look for outside of the mainstream):\ne.g. [The Levon Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair)\n\n(I invite you to reflect on how many environmental activists below 25 are casually familiar with this episode?)\n\nBut the benefits can quickly dissolve when it is used as a mainstream mouthpiece, to satisfy the confirmation bias of anyone who doesn't wish to have to confront the tidal wave of pro-environmentalism that pervades the political climate around the World.\n\n![make_love_not_co2.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_106_make_love_not_co2.jpeg)\n\nWhat motivates the political class when it comes to the environment?

Why would those who want you to bow down to 'higher' authority wish for you to bow down to 'higher' authority?\n\n![bow_to_queen.jpeg (264x191)](data/img/post_106_bow_to_queen.jpeg)\n\nMotive isn't evidence of a crime. It's merely a stimulus to investigation. I don't insist that I'm 'Right' on every aspect of environmentalism, but I do urge that we answer the call to investigate, on our own terms. There is an important political struggle taking place beneath the surface of this debate that goes way beyond any potential impact this, that or the other environmental policy that may be imposed on all of us. It is the age old struggle for the locus of power between the individual and the State. Since we all occupy the same planet, the idea that human beings are somehow vandalizing it by having the audacity to improve their economic circumstances plays right into the familiar old conventions of self-sacrifice, one nation (now one World) and the insignificance of the individual in relation to the pre-eminence of the State (now World State). The same messages that the 20th Century taught us, in no uncertain terms, were devastating in their _actual_ effects on humanity\n\n![nazi_salutes.jpeg (299x168)](data/img/post_106_nazi_salutes.jpeg)\n\n![hiroshima.jpeg (318x159)](data/img/post_106_hiroshima.jpeg)\n\n_Real_, human impacts on the 'environment'.

It's unpopularity, particularly among the 'educated' classes, is a useful litmus test for the extent to which the death grip of the 'environmental' python as political phenomenon has taken hold within the minds of so many.\n\n![educated_activists.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_106_educated_activists.jpeg)\n\nIronic.\nOne of the things we do learn at school, despite all the indoctrination, is that there is a great deal that we do not know.

			"body": "Original:\n[Bloody chaos in Hong Kong as man bites politician's ear](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12282173)\n\nThis is a mixed up story. We're given a photo of a man who had his 'ear bitten off'. The article then proceeds to tell us 'At least four people were injured by a blade-wielding man'. Was it a 'blade-wielding' biting man or another man altogether? 'He was said to have argued with others over political issues before the incident.' But we have no idea from what 'political' angle he was coming.\n\nCertain features tend to creep out of stories like this. For anyone casually browsing the news, which is what most people do, it's all too easy to conflate radical, violence, protesters, and chaos etc.\n\n![violent_protestors.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_105_violent_protestors.jpeg)\n\nWe can find out a bit about [Andrew Chiu](http://andrewchiu.net/2007dc/English.html), the man who was regrettably bitten.\n\nA Statist aspirant who perhaps, one day, dreams of being a Carrie Lam replacement (with some tweaks). Despite all the fine talk, he still believes in extortion as way to get you what _he_ thinks is in your best interests. Does he deserve to have his ear bitten off for this delusion? Of course not.\n\n![andrew_chiu.gif (760x149)](data/img/post_105_andrew_chiu.gif)\n\n\"protesters succeeded in gaining access to shopping centers in several neighborhoods, forming human chains, chanting slogans and blocking entrances to prevent police officers from entering.\n\nAlthough the protests were less violent than the previous day's, they ended in bloodshed when a man charged into a crowd that had gathered at the Cityplaza mall in the middle-class neighborhood of Tai Koo Shing.\"\n\nA crowd, not a crowd of protesters. They may have been, but it's curious that it's not mentioned that way. So at this point we don't know if a person or persons, are knife wielding and/or biting, into crowds who may or may not be 'protesters'. But we are told that:\n\n'Police said in a statement that they stormed into the shopping centers after activists started vandalizing interiors and smashing windows.' By any standards \"vandalizing interiors and smashing windows\" is a desperate way to make a political point. Especially one that everyone already understands. Really this just serves to make the State appear relatively reasonable. Who benefits from the destruction of property?\n\n\"activists have continued to demonstrate against what they describe as police brutality and overall frustration at a government they feel has refused to listen to them\". Instead of ignoring the institutions of the State, they have made the mistake of engaging in the State constructed processes - only to be confronted by police brutality and indifference. But this is actually what they set themselves up for by voting. The vast majority of people who vote believe in some form of 'law and order' service provided by the State. Anyone who doesn't vote (like myself) doesn't believe in Democracy at all and may well, if non-violent, be an Agorist (whether consciously or otherwise).\n\n![agora.jpeg (440x451)](data/img/post_105_agora.jpeg)\n\nDespite the nod to balanced reporting:\n'The weekend's clashes were the latest bout of violence in Hong Kong's worst political crisis since the former British colony was returned to China in 1997\\. Protests began in early June against an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to face trial in mainland China, where Communist Party influence in the court system results in a 99.9 per cent conviction rate.'\n\n![chinese_courts.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_105_chinese_courts.jpeg)\n\nThat may be true, but the message that really emerges from this article, as is so often the case, is simply protesters, destruction, violence and chaos.\n\nThe reader is funneled into a false dichotomy (choice). Order vs chaos. Thus implicitly positioned somewhere on a spectrum between these two extremes. What seems more 'reasonable' at the end of the day (for most people the answer is simply a function of their background (programming))?\n\nThe choice is actually anarchy vs order/chaos (because 'order', taken to it's logical extreme in human affairs results in chaos at the individual level (example, the individual within the USSR/China/Cuba/Nazi Germany etc.)). Chaos for the individual, because the individual is reduced to being a mere tool of the State, self-sacrificing to the detriment of himself and everyone else, dragging the whole of society down to the lowest common denominator and eliminating all the advantages of economic and political development that enhance the quality of life.\n\n![soviet_bread_line.jpeg (320x157)](data/img/post_105_soviet_bread_line.jpeg)\n\nThe HK protesters, brave though they are, are making the simple point that the State destroys freedom. No need to shout and scream like people who are unable to handle themselves in a constructive way to make that point. I suggest simply withdrawing consent and trading outside the 'system' using the kinds of (State free) technologies I encourage below.\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

[Ayn Rand nailed it really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv3VkSwhhkU).\n\nThe Agora differs from Objectivism on the point of minarchism. My understanding is that Objectivism holds that minarchism is necessary for an absolutely minimal State for 'essential services' such as policing and defense. In the Agora these services can only be provided voluntarily and contractually on the free market.\n\n[Larken Rose sets out the differences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Rfxa8c7veU)\n\nIncidentally, following a quick review of comments in Larken's video, if the best argument anyone can come out with against your position is that very few people subscribe to it, they may, inadvertently have just made an argument for, not against that position, because they are arguing from popularity, [which is a logical fallacy if relied on heavily](https://yandoo.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/argumentum-ad-populum-argument-from-popularity/).\n\nMs Fixter used disability as a selling point (it's in the company name) and is then disappointed that the response reflects the altruism back on her (people only come to virtue signal). Altruism, whether you agree with Rand or not, has no economic value. People, quite rightly in my view, expect to exchange value for value. The solution to her problem is to create the best pizza in town, disabled workers or otherwise. If not she's in the wrong business. It's great to see people being honest and true to themselves in this kind of situation, only being prepared to exchange value where it is received. If only people were able to do this in relation to the State, since that would eventually dissolve the State altogether.\n\nIf people pay you for something they will be looking to take a piece of value away from you in exchange. This is a harsh reality that we all face on a daily basis. Only you can know if that exchange is worth it. Only you can do something about it. If you are paid for nothing then value has been taken from someone else. The State wants us all to be confused about this so that it can hide the activity that it labels a crime if we do it individually (extortion), but the 'Law' if it does it to perpetuate it's existence, partly by providing 'free services' to the needy.\n\n![free_money_from_gov.jpeg (299x168)](data/img/post_104_free_money_from_gov.jpeg)\n\nAnyone who really wants to help the needy can create a business that reduces the impact of the disability, whatever form that takes. They can 'selfishly' make as much profit as they like as disabled people will exchange whatever value they possess to obtain the advantages. Of course, any prospective business will currently have to navigate the taxes, regulations and numerous other hurdles created by the State in it's attempts to control free and open trade. Which is perhaps why some are tempted to throw in the towel and play the State's game of appealing to altruism in an attempt to fool people into making one sided exchanges. I suggest not attempting to adopt such an approach when you're completely outnumbered, outclassed and, ultimately, out gunned by the experts. The best approach, I suggest, is to expose their game for what it is, not attempt to emulate it in response to a lifetime of indoctrination.\n\n![lifetime_indoctrination.jpeg (294x171)](data/img/post_104_lifetime_indoctrination.jpeg)​​​​​​​\n\nThere are a lot of good people in this story, working hard to make a better life for themselves. I suggest they get the vision right and base it own their own true, primarily selfish, desires. Self-sacrifice helps no-one in the end and has a long history of ending in disaster for countless individuals. It serves the State, but not humanity, for you to end up like this\n\n![war_dead.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_104_war_dead.jpeg)\n\nas an example to those who remain. Is that really, honestly, what _you_ want? The lesson is obvious, but largely depends on your predisposition. I suggest seeing the world as it is with open eyes, before it is too late for your one, precious life.\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

[This is why, historically, they've had a tendency to be reluctant to recognize it.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333394/Seventy-years-late-Russia-finally-admits-slaughter-20-000-Polish-officers-Katyn-Stalin-s-orders.html)\n\nHowever, after WW2 it became impossible to ignore the issue, since it was useful to retrospectively rely on the Holocaust to justify the otherwise very thin reasons for the wholesale slaughter of the War. In 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG). As usual, in our interests of course, it set itself up as a great protector, so that it could selectively intervene in the politics of whole nations, according to the best interests of ... the United Nations.\n\n[\"The first draft of the Convention included political killings, but these provisions were removed in a political and diplomatic compromise following objections from some countries, including the USSR\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide).\n\nHowever, 'The Soviet views were also shared by a number of other States for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator: Lebanon, Sweden, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Egypt, Belgium, and Uruguay. The exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non-governmental organization, the World Jewish Congress'.\n\nIn other words, even non-State actors realized that no State comes into existence without political violence against political groups/individuals it is opposed to, so provisions protecting them could become 'problematic'.\n\nIndeed, anyone who understands what the State is, understands that it cannot logically hold two contradictory positions. It cannot destroy and protect at the same time.\n\nUnless you, as an individual, play the State game, by the State rules, the UN won't afford you any protection:\nPlease consider 'francs-tireurs' (\"free shooters\") i.e. an arms bearing civilian\n\n[\"according to Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, francs-tireurs are entitled to prisoner-of-war status provided that they are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates, have a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry arms openly, and conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francs-tireurs)\n\n(franc-tireur)\n\n![franc_tireur.jpeg (297x170)](data/img/post_103_franc_tireur.jpeg)\n\nIn other words, provided they are not francs-tireurs. So if you want to protect yourself and your family you must conform with Statist norms. [On the other hand it is Statist norms that lay the foundation for genocide](https://www.genocidewatch.com/ten-stages-of-genocide.).\n\nGrappling with this is not new, of course, but it's rarely discussed in such terms:\n\nIn an article in the 13 September 1919 issue of Illustrated London News, the writer G. K. Chesterton wrote:\n\n\"a \"franc-tireur\" is you or I or any other healthy man who found himself, when attacked, in accidental possession of a gun or pistol, and not in accidental possession of a particular cap or a particular pair of trousers. The distinction is not a moral distinction at all, but a crude and recent official distinction\"\n\n![chesterton.jpeg (258x196)](data/img/post_103_chesterton.jpeg)\n\nQuite. But who finds themselves in 'accidental possession of a gun or pistol'? It's you or I in _deliberate_ possession of a gun. Who ever knows when they will be attacked? That's _why_ we possess a gun (in this context) in the first place.\n\nThe only solution to genocide, like any physical aggression, is simply individual possession of effective weapons for all (if unwilling/unable to do so yourself you can hire those who will on your behalf). The State will continually attempt to add qualifiers to avoid making itself obsolete. Badges, trousers, hats, 'leaders', conduct in accordance with the 'laws of war' etc.\n\n![military_uniforms.jpeg (264x191)](data/img/post_103_military_uniforms.jpeg)\n\nThis recent resolution passing is likely a symptom of a more (Internet) informed public tired of the political capital that's been made out of the Holocaust. \"Get behind our Statism, because it's morally superior to their Statism\", is all they're ever really saying.\n\nAs an Armenian subjected to such an ordeal would you prefer to have available an effective weapon to resist a gang of indoctrinated costume wearers physically attacking your family or a declaration by some hypocritical gathering of power mongers 100 years later that they don't agree with 'genocide'? Which one is more likely to prevent another 'genocide'(?); the apparent justification for this new pronouncement.\n\nThe Resolution is yet another vapid attempt to cover up the hypocrisy that sits at the heart of the State. I suggest not looking to the State, for protection from ... the State ... on a small or a grand scale ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

They 'persuade' you to do this by offering a false dichotomy (choice): \"take part in the voting process (no matter how unrepresentative the 'choices') or we assume power over you regardless\".

Giving away power by allowing it to draw closer to 'ordinary' people is anathema to them. Brexit is not popular within the Parliament. Where has the authority for these laws extending the political and economic connections to the EU come from? When you understand that all these men and women jumping up and down and shouting are simply that ([but not chimps as some might imply](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/?Post:96:Monkey+Madness:+Statist+Enabler+Feeds+Off+Cheap+Insults) ), you realize it's time to start assuming responsibility for your own power and the good judgment that goes with it.\n\nIt's time to start ignoring those dimensions of the EU monolith that epitomize it's stranglehold on freedom.\n\nEven a die-hard Statist will admit it when it comes up against his own maneuverings. Environment Secretary Michael Gove:\n\n[\"Every single day, every single minister is told: 'Yes Minister, I understand, but I'm afraid that's against EU rules.' I know it. My colleagues in government know it.

Show them that they are impotent when the scam has been unveiled. If these endless extensions don't make it clear then nothing will. Don't imagine that a product of that system, Boris Johnson, is going to save you the trouble. He's there to make a song and dance and rant about how his 'hands are tied' in an attempt, once again, to make you believe that there is someone 'up there' looking out for your interests.

It can be a cause for celebration if it serves to reveal the true nature of Government, power and the State, which, to a degree, it has already. The mainstream media will attempt to use the occasion to try to persuade people to come to the conclusion (on their own of course, once they've been exposed to all the (selectively emphasized) facts) that they are 'powerless' in the face of the 'Brexit crisis'.

			"body": "Original:\n[39 Bodies Found In Essex Container](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/uk-england-essex-50152633)\n\n39 people have died a horrible death. Who or what is responsible? What led them to pay for and voluntarily undertake what they must have known was a risky, extremely uncomfortable and potentially deadly trip?\n\nState regulation of borders and trade meant that these people had to hide inside the truck.\n\nWe all have borders. Like anything else, if it's something we care about, we can either pay to protect them ourselves or combine with others to pay for them. Such a Border Protection Force would only be as effective, and extensive, as your group would be willing to pay. As a liability of no productive economic value it would be a drain on resources so over extension would make no economic sense, which would serve to limit such a force's range. You may be in possession of such an effective force and such a desirable economic region that people would pay for assistance and risk their lives to enter it undetected. That would be their choice. I suggest we don't allow State activity, such as war and/or internal oppression, to justify State activity - creating an extortion racket to keep 'undesirables' out. Confusion then sits on top of confusion to create a problem that no-one can solve and no-one wants to take responsibility for.\n\n![confusion2.jpeg (297x170)](data/img/post_101_confusion2.jpeg)\n\nAn economic zone into which migrants have entered is of no use to them unless they engage in economic activity within it. In the Agora this would be free economic activity, unencumbered by the regulations of an extortion racket. If whatever services they could provide were required they could be paid for, otherwise the incentives to remain would rapidly diminish with little need for enforcement to eject them. This, of course, assumes the absence of such Statist constructs as 'social security' etc. again obtained via extortion, which, as ever, would distort the markets and complicate the issue.\n\n![simple_or_complex.jpeg (276x183)](data/img/post_101_simple_or_complex.jpeg)\n\nCurrently, the people who, quite understandably, feel great empathy for the migrants in this lorry have no way to practically exercise their goodwill towards them e.g. by only subscribing to border protection forces that accurately reflect their values and exercise relatively tolerant standards. They are trapped inside the Statist paradigm. They can only bleat their disapproval and perhaps wait for the next round of the false dichotomy ritual referred to as voting in the vague hope that a subject of the State correctly represents their values.\n\n![blairs_war.jpeg (299x168)](data/img/post_101_blairs_war.jpeg)\n\nIf they're not prepared to pay for their own service, or, perhaps, would prefer one with a very high barrier to entry, then the consequences would fall squarely at their own feet and be a matter for their own conscience. There would be no 'Government' to conveniently blame.\n\n![blame_the_government.jpeg (355x142)](data/img/post_101_blame_the_government.jpeg)\n\nIn such circumstances anyone who wanted to help migrants might contract with them for services of economic value.\n\n![gardeners.jpeg (299x168)](data/img/post_101_gardeners.jpeg)\nJust an example\n\nIt may not be ideal for anyone. Few things are. But neither are empty, meaningless expressions of empathy whilst we wait, under the current paradigm, for the next container to horribly kill another batch of people who inhabit the same planet we do, attempting to make a better life for themselves and trying to avoid Statist constructs to do it. We can all relate to that ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

Yours vs theirs. Who are they? The State. The people who force you (at gunpoint if necessary) to 'follow' them. Who are 'you'? That may seem like a facetious question but anyone who is stripped of all their power (a slave) can be degraded to the point that they do not know who they are or what they believe in (Frederick Douglas). The State gaslights you into self-doubt and confusion so that you can more easily be manipulated into giving away more real power. Brexit is an attempt to mitigate the gas-lighting, but, as is often the case, longer term solutions often require greater short term pain.\n\n![confusion.jpeg (210x240)](data/img/post_100_confusion.jpeg)\n\nThe British Parliament is an institution of Statism. It's members all swear allegiance to the Head of State, the Queen. Devolving power is anathema to their instincts. It reduces their options for deal making, compromise (at the expense of their 'constituents'), maneuvering, politicking and power accumulation in general. To tell big lies, you need a big platform.\n\n![colin_powell_un.jpeg (318x159)](data/img/post_100_colin_powell_un.jpeg)\n\nColin Powell - UN\n\nWhen everyone agrees that violently forcing ideas onto others is a good thing, getting to be the one who everyone agrees is 'in charge' is important. Simply being 'in charge' of oneself and one's voluntary interactions with others won't cut it. It's all about forcing others to do what they '_know_' is best. The more 'others' there are to force, the better. An 'institution' is required to facilitate the process. This one was adequate for a while\n\n![parliament.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_100_parliament.jpeg)\n\nBut to wield power over a truly large number of people something truly ambitious in scope is required\n\n![eu_parliament.jpeg (342x147)](data/img/post_100_eu_parliament.jpeg)\n\nThe impulse of the State is towards the expansion of it's power at the expense of yours. This is how the EU came into being. People have noticed. They want to reverse the trend. An 'elite' statist politician has emerged who appears to be their 'champion'. He appears to be exercising the 'will of the People', but he is compromising with the EU and about to extend the 'deadline' yet again. His 'hands are tied', he's 'forced into a corner', he 'cannot easily revert' etc.\n\n![powerless_boris.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_100_powerless_boris.jpeg)\n\nIf he, the most powerful individual 'champion of the People' is powerless, how powerful are you, really?\n\n![powerless.jpeg (276x183)](data/img/post_100_powerless.jpeg)\n\nThey will pour over all the details, use the old, worn out expressions like 'responsibility', 'considering the economy', 'understanding the delicate Irish political situation' (originally caused, as well, by the State's attempts to resist separation). Lies, excuses and the blustering of politicians to create a smoke and mirrors theater that undermines any meaningful separation from the European super state.\n\n![escape_from_europe.jpeg (252x200)](data/img/post_100_escape_from_europe.jpeg)\n\nI suggest not working for the State in any capacity. Only with other, real, people. Organize trade and security via negotiated contracts, both within your traditionally recognized geographical area (referred to as your country) and elsewhere (anywhere in the World). The State will never represent _you_, unless you believe in violently forcing your ideas onto others. In which case, you will be right at home in Europe, but not in the Agora.\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

The only thing standing between each one of us and deadly violence is the thoughts coursing through our minds at each moment. How many thoughts does each one of us have in a day? How many billions of lives have passed that never came close to realizing deadly violence against another? In all of those lives countless thoughts. Fortunately, a very tiny proportion, if not all 'good', are, at least, not deadly.\n\nTwo major contributing factors for violent thoughts are a climate of fear and a credible threat. Two criteria that State's have a track record for exacerbating.\n\n![crucified_soldier.jpeg (200x253)](data/img/post_99_crucified_soldier.jpeg)\n\nViolent thoughts are almost always connected to defending something even if that may not be tangible (honor, pride, nation etc.). Unprovoked, mindless violence for no defensive reason at all is most often connected to mental illness and cannot reasonably be treated any differently to how we might consider a dangerous, unpredictable, wild animal (so that category is not under consideration here).\n\nThe problem is the human that believes he/she needs to defend themselves against something and there is disagreement about what that 'something' is. Is it a 'legitimate' defense? The State, with it's contorted logic, can convince itself that the use of deadly force to secure it's plunder is legitimate because, for example, that [plunder is used to 'defend the nation' etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion)\n\n![WhiskeyRebellion.jpg (500x317)](data/img/post_99_WhiskeyRebellion.jpg)\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion of 1791\n\nThe distinguishing feature of 'legitimacy' - violent extortion.\n\nIt all depends on what we are taught to consider 'legitimate'. One vehicle for instructing us all on what is/is not legitimate is the hallowed institutions of the Law. In the title article there is a difference between how the defense and the judge view the evidence:\n\nDefense:\n'The lack of evidence [linking to terrorism] is not a proper basis for drawing a conclusion there is evidence of a terrorist connection.'\n\nJudge:\n'You replicated the acts of others who undoubtedly have acted with terrorist motives'.\n\nIs replicating acts the basis for connecting a defendant with an 'illegitimate' motive?\n\nI used my mobile phone today. I expect a terrorist somewhere in the World has done the same. I replicated his acts and he has undoubtedly acted with terrorist motives. Am I now a terrorist? Perhaps we all are? How convenient.\n\nHow about if I unloaded a gun into a uniformed policeman? That would replicate the act of a terrorist. Have I 'undoubtedly' therefore acted with terrorist motives?\n\n[What if that policeman had broken into my flat and was about to shoot me?](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/?Post:95:Off+Duty+Statist+Caged+For+Mistake) What if I was known to have written an 'illegitimate' blog because it questions the legitimacy of the State? There is plenty of evidence for that. It might all depend on what we imagine is actually going on.\n\n[It seems the 'legitimate' are allowed to imagine things where the 'illegitimate' are not](not: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/fbi-memo-conspiracy-theories-domestic-terrorism), because ['conspiracy theories' are always wrong - right?](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1175375/9-11-world-trade-center-twin-towers-September-11-conspiracy-theories)\n\nIn the climate of fear we live under how many would concur with this judge and make that all too easy leap of faith away from the evidence and into a massive extension of State power? All for our own 'good' of course.\n\nFor clarity, I don't mind if this bizarre individual receives a harsh punishment, ultimately, for his ridiculous, dangerous behavior. An armed citizen could have shot him if really necessary. But the real danger is not abortions like this chap, [no matter how depressingly frequently they arise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-ramming_attack), but rather how such behavior is interpreted and manifested among the sane and 'legitimate', to undermine the freedoms of the rest of us, which is essential in countering the climate of fear the State attempts to foster for it's own ends.\n\nWould this headline have been possible without free speech?\n\n![blair_apologises.jpeg (294x172)](data/img/post_99_blair_apologises.jpeg)\n\nBeing opposed to the manifestation of the law as expressed by the State does not imply opposition to the fundamental principles of the law such as the necessity for evidence. I suggest we not allow 'odd' cases like this one to blur the distinctions, especially when the blurring is done by a 'legitimate' representative of the State."

It's an easy way to avoid responsibility for understanding what's actually going on and our role in it (for example, by voting).\n\n![corrupt_politicians.jpeg (271x186)](data/img/post_98_corrupt_politicians.jpeg)\n\nThe net worth of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, is approximately $3.1 billion according to Forbes as of 5 March 2019, whereas Bloomberg estimated his wealth at $2.8 billion\nSource: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Donald_Trump)\n\nWhat is the salary of US President in 2019?\nSalary $400,000 annually\nSource: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States)\n\nWhy would someone who's personal wealth stands at approximately $3 billion opt for intense scrutiny and constant pressure for a relatively measily salary?

However, the problems of the World are, in part, created by the State that aggresses, not the State that withdraws. For sure a withdrawing State may only do so for tactical purposes or for other ulterior and self-serving reasons. That should hardly come as a shock. Withdrawal is, almost always, preferable to advance for those inclined towards peace. The U.S, has advanced in so many places, on so many occasions, that it's presence is now taken for granted by it's 'Allies'. Who are these allies the author is so concerned for? The Kurds, Tony Blair's favorite justification for invading other countries. They're all so keen to support separatists who want to break free from the oppression of the State.

Physically and to the quality of life (of which freedom is an essential component). We're always told that there is a 'separation of power' and that the court systems are distinct from the political legislature and executive. This is a convenient lie. Courts are deeply political by default as they represent the existing order. If the existing order is an extortion racket you have a problem. If you peacefully object to this political scam you will be caged for a substantial period as per the article title. If you violently resist you will probably not be as good at violence as the entity you are attempting to replace (if you are, you may become the new 'State', either way no actual progress, or even, quite probably, regression).\n\n![one_step_forward_2_back.jpeg (305x165)](data/img/post_97_one_step_forward_2_back.jpeg)\n\nThe problem that these brave Catalan leaders have discovered the hard way is that their ideas are not too strong, but too weak. They are proposing replacing a larger state with a smaller one. A step in the right direction, but it still leaves a State. The Catalan leaders believe they can create a better extortion racket than the national Spanish State. The national State is playing the statist game by statist rules. It's bigger, more powerful and prepared to use violence to have it's way. All principles the Catalans leaders believe in as well, just not when applied to themselves as a group. They would have no problem applying these principles to sub groups within a Catalan State and this undermines their position on principle.\n\nI suggest understanding the true nature of the State before challenging it, otherwise you might find yourself having a great deal of time on your hands to contemplate the distinctions (you may anyway, but at least the principles upon which you are caged could be more sound and represent a clearer delineation between the violent (State) and the relatively harmless (individual)).\n\n![long_term_prison.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_97_long_term_prison.jpeg)\n\nThese people haven't done any physical harm.

All over the World such sentences help reveal the true nature of the State. These brave people's suffering will not be in vain if the idea of freedom from the State, which they partially promoted, grows as a result of this savage treatment.\n\n![catalan_leaders.jpeg (265x190)](data/img/post_97_catalan_leaders.jpeg)​​​​​​​\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

Has it been done before?\n2\\. What exactly are you subverting?\n3\\. Does the work relate to your own experience?\n4\\. What’s at stake?\ntl;dr: Take risks but no cheap tricks.\n\n1\\. For me this tedious picture has all the originality of a seaside resort postcard. The ubiquitous 'Dogs Playing Poker' style comes to mind:\n\n![dogs_playing_poker.jpeg (265x190)](data/img/post_96_dogs_playing_poker.jpeg)\n\nHardly original\n\n2\\. Good question. If you've read any of my other posts in 'Agora' you will be aware that I'm quite far outside Overton's Window when it comes to political discourse. This is because I believe the time has come for us to question the very foundations of our political structures so that we can re-build in a more constructive and enlightened way towards a better future. One of the most pernicious problems of our current system of Parliamentary democracy is that it has a tendency to encourage irresponsible 'hands off' attitudes towards politics, dumping everything onto a politician and then spending the rest of the time bemoaning the 'incompetence and corruption' of politicians. I believe many Parliamentary politicians never seriously contemplate alternatives systems to the State and are, it appears to them, forced into playing the game by the State's rules. It is also the belief of the vast majority of society that there is really only one way to go in politics (via Parliamentary democracy). As such they have voted for, what they believe, are the most articulate and intelligent to represent them. Dissatisfaction that arises as a result comes from that politician mediating his politics through the State apparatus in such a way that it is ultimately the State that succeeds in extending it's power and control at the expense of the people who brought it into existence. Who's fault is that? The politicians? Not entirely. They, like everyone else, are simply taken in by the process. What does depicting your most articulate and intelligent representatives as chimps say about you? It is hard to imagine a more stark Statist message than the one being depicted in this 'art'. 'You and your representatives are sub-human and need to be shown the way by a 'higher authority''. But it is subversive. It is subverting ordinary people and re-enforcing the idea of the State.\n\n3\\. 'Banksy' is anonymous! How is that even possible? I'm surprised no-one is interested in attempting to track him down. In our information overloaded age all those who question the State are ending up with one of everything. One persistent information source - Wikileaks, one persistent whistle-blower - Snowden (with a bit of man/woman/man/woman etc. Manning), one persistent 'subversive' artist - Banksy. Whether by accident or design we should be skeptical of such simple story-lines, it's too easy for them to be controlled. So Banky's 'experience' cannot be assessed. How convenient...\n\n4\\. Not much, it seems, as an anonymous person cannot be imprisoned or otherwise sacrificed. In the broader sense what's at stake is our gas-lighted minds. This Banksy nonsense is the lights being dimmed in the house of the film. On the one hand there are just random meaningless messages plastered about all over the place that say almost nothing and on the other we get undermining insults directed at ourselves, the Commoners, to prevent us from gaining the confidence to use all the information on the Internet to figure out what's going on (with the economy for one example).\n\nIf there are puppeteers at the very top playing this game they might well heed the summary point. The tricks are getting cheaper and easier to spot. From the child crusaders like Greta, to the cardboard cutout 'rebels' like Assange and Snowden and the 'subversive' artists like Banksy, it's all getting a bit predictable. The message is that we are shameful, stupid animals. Cast your mind back over history to figure out how that message plays out...\n\nWe need something truly inspiring, truly enlightening and truly subversive. A seaside postcard won't do. How about a quiet but irresistible movement towards greater understanding of how ordinary people are being manipulated by confusion, fear and deceit through a larger uncensored network of intelligent debate, the open minded acquisition of new (which are often actually old) ideas and an informed and detailed look into the true mechanisms of power? Just a suggestion ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

Unless the journalist somehow got it wrong I find the details a little confusing. No one appears to question this was a mistake, but the report states she was found guilty of murder. You cannot commit murder by mistake. A mistake is manslaughter (or a similar offence in US). The distinguishing feature of murder is intent.\n\nOn top of this we find that the 'crowd' jeered at the sentence but the brother gave her a hug! There can be a wide disparity between what an individual wants and what 'society' thinks it knows is best. Without being specifically told, pondering the point for a moment and treating it as simply an unusual anomaly we could be forgiven for assuming that the brother would have been jeering along with the crowd. Contrary to the impression we are so often encouraged to adopt in the mainstream media(MM) the vast majority of individuals can and do 'rise above' in small ways in their daily lives. Perhaps not to the same extent as this extraordinary brother, but even so, to a greater degree than they are often given credit for. Unspoken, conflict free, co-operation in hundreds of small ways throughout each and every day. Like many things that actually work well it only gets noticed when it breaks down, which is the exception rather than the rule.\n\n![black_friday_shoppers.jpeg (284x177)](data/img/post_95_black_friday_shoppers.jpeg)\n\n(Black Friday shoppers)\n\nWhen it does break down it is raked over by the State serving MM and often, seemingly innocently, implicitly touted as 'evidence' of the need for 'authorities' to step in and take control. The 'thin blue line' between civility and chaos (which is usually mislabeled 'anarchy'). Level heads, benevolent values and good judgement will all trickle down from the 'dear leaders' at the top.\n\n![dear_leaders.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_95_dear_leaders.jpeg)\n\nWhich brings us back to our hapless shooter.\n\nGood judgement can ultimately only come from within. We are often told that it is fine to (sometimes heavily) arm huge sections of the population as long as they have a badge, a costume and become dependent on the State's plunder.\n\n![heavily_armed_police.jpeg (268x188)](data/img/post_95_heavily_armed_police.jpeg)\n\nOf course, they will be trained as well, as anyone who handles anything that could negatively impact others should _volunteer_ to do.\n\n![learning_to_shoot.jpeg (275x184)](data/img/post_95_learning_to_shoot.jpeg)\n\nIs the State sanctioned 'judgement' 'better' at the end of this process? Where is the aggression initiated? How often are peaceful protests attacked by the State?\n\n![police_attack.jpeg (283x178)](data/img/post_95_police_attack.jpeg)\n\n(Catalan demonstrations attacked)\n\nWe all make mistakes, even when handling potentially deadly machinery like cars. Whose mistakes do we want to live under? One's in which the responsibility lies entirely with ourselves for all the decisions made leading up to the mistake or one's we edge towards under duress?\n\n![blair_iraq_war_speech.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_95_blair_iraq_war_speech.jpeg)\n\n(Blair's Iraq War)\n\nBy paying tax we are forced to finance security services known as the police 'for our own good'. One of the primary reasons given for this is that somehow the 'judgments' that are made by such enforcers are supposedly superior to the one's you, I or millions of other ordinary people might otherwise make. This will be the position taken by Statists in Hong Kong after the recent shooting of a protester. \"You must conform to our agenda for the suppression of freedom because we are the only entity capable of preserving 'law and order'\". The problem for them is that the ranks of their 'morally superior' enforcers are actually populated by (very) ordinary people whose judgments are no better, or worse, than anyone else's, as the title article helps us to appreciate.\n\nThe only enforcers that can reliably reflect our own values are the one's we have chosen ourselves (and pay for). Our choices will be mediated by the market. We won't get exactly what we want in every instance ... the crucial difference is that the choice will have been ours and we individually bear the responsibility for the consequences, taking our business elsewhere the moment we become 'concerned' by the activities of our chosen agency. A good deal more effective, I suggest, than [reading Guardian articles](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/priti-patel-record-human-rights-extreme-concern) and writing to your MP (or other State representative).\n\nAs an (albeit costume wearing) civilian she has a heavy price to pay for her mistake. It will be interesting to see how the Hong Kong shooter's treatment compares.\n\nWhatever happens, the real lesson is that the biggest mistake, and one we have an opportunity to avoid right now, is to imagine that costumes, badges, training and an 'authoritative' tone transform anyone from ordinary human into something somehow superior.\n\n![gen_sir_mike_jackson.jpeg (292x173)](data/img/post_95_gen_sir_mike_jackson.jpeg)\n\n(Gen. Sir Mike Jackson - juggling the complexities)\n\nThe State is a fiction founded on aggression. The sooner this is understood around the world the sooner we will create an environment in which good judgement is rewarded and poor judgement has real consequences for all of us as individuals.\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

Except for an important new twist. The Statist enforcer pulls out his gun and shoots a protester in the chest.\nDepending on the protester's survival there will be a prima facie case for (attempted) murder against the enforcer (people aren't yet indoctrinated enough to believe this is part of a 'War on Terror' in which case no PR ritual trials would be required).\nHis defense will lie, in part, on self-defense, mainly because of the stick and perhaps partly on other factors like the other protesters and the general atmosphere of conflict.\n\nSo what evidence is there of 'premeditated'? This is not difficult. He had a gun loaded with live ammunition! We only need to switch costumes to see the dynamics. The protester has the gun, the enforcer has a stick (which he was using in a desperate attempt to save his life[?]). Is the protester guilty of murder? What was he doing turning up to a peaceful rally fully armed with a lethal weapon? Surely that would make him a terrorist!? A good moment to pause and consider why the US Second Amendment exists ... (it's not because people have an irrational love of guns and/or violence, in fact, the exact, as this moment shows, opposite). The imbalance of power has fed the impunity of this enforcer, which has led to his tragically violent behavior.\n\nUntil the DARPA scientists have [fully implemented their genetically engineered Statist enforcer programme](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/military-technology-pentagon-robots/406786/) let's assume they are both human beings as the term is currently understood.\n\nSo everything turns on 'unlawful'. This is where the defense will really lie, because all other factors being equal, this was clearly a disproportionate use of violence in the application of 'self-defense'.\n\n\"Unlawful\"\n'not conforming to, permitted by, or recognized by law or rules'\nOxford\n\nDoes the law permit and recognize rioting? Only in the sense that it will cage, for years, anyone it convicts of doing it. Who made up the 'law or rules'? The State. This is a State enforcer. His acts are transformed from unlawful to lawful by the receipt of plunder, a costume, a badge and a lot of people who think he's a 'jolly good fellow'\n\n![us_veterans_honoured.jpeg (260x194)](data/img/post_94_us_veterans_honoured.jpeg)\n\nThere may well be [a PR exercise referred to as a 'trial', but everyone knows which side the bread is buttered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/hong-kong-police-officers-cleared-2014-protester-beating-190726053552384.html):\n\nThis is the context in which this enforcer will be judged in his actions towards someone who otherwise would not have been shot had it not been for their desire to protest the imbalance of power and their inability to 'protest' effectively via a lawfully recognized mechanism which is the one set up by ... the State! [This is why appeal to the law is a logical fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/73/Appeal-to-the-Law)\n\nThis doesn't resolve until it is understood and recognized that the State is premised upon violent aggression in the first instance. How 'necessary' you believe that is will inform how you view this moment captured on video.\n\nDoes Statism encourage peace, stability and good judgement on the part of ordinary people (which both these 'human beings' are) or does it encourage poor judgement that leans towards violent solutions? Where did that gun come from? What ideas about 'right' and 'wrong' went through the enforcer's mind in that moment? How is he, and millions like him, encouraged to think by Statism that conditions our minds from birth?\n\nIn Hong Kong these distinctions have been highlighted thanks to the courage of the people forcing it out into the open. But you don't have to actually riot to make them. Once enough people can think beyond the State's hypocrisy and lies it only becomes necessary to withdraw consent. That's the peaceful route away from this Statist chaos. That's Anarchy. That's Agorism."

Dragging their family members into the debate suggests an agenda on the part of the title publication. It's a weak assertion, arguing by association. However, like many otherwise throw away headlines, it touches on a significant issue: free speech.\n\nDefinition of tasteless:\n\n\"considered to be lacking in aesthetic judgement or to constitute inappropriate behaviour\"\n(Oxford dictionary)\n\nSince we're talking politics and not aesthetics we focus on the second part 'inappropriate behaviour'. As you break it down it is clear that the definitions hinge on subjective values. In other words not saying anything other than 'I don't like what you're saying'.\n\n![dont_like.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_93_dont_like.jpeg)\n\nIt is a pointless headline other than that it prompted me to consider, once again, what free speech is.\n\nIf you are unable to express yourself you are not free. This is self-evident but not appreciated. Your self expression may disgust other people. They are free to avoid your non-physically aggressive expressions (sight and sound taken as non-physical). I suggest that people must use their own judgment and have the means to repulse physical aggression that violates their own free expression (that itself doesn't impinge, of course there will be 'grey' areas, that's for us to work out). Otherwise they are not free in any meaningful sense of the word. They may be many other things, happy, protected, secure, comfortable etc., but not free. You may find that opinion disgusting, in which case I would find your opinion disgusting. The most that can ever amount to is circumstantial evidence of intent. If you, or I, converted that 'disgust' into acts of physical aggression something materially different would be occurring. A physical act may require a physical response. A non-physical act does not require a physical response, despite what this, intelligent, man might have said:\n\n![oliver_wendell_holmes.jpeg (198x254)](data/img/post_93_oliver_wendell_holmes.jpeg)\nin Schenck v. United States\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr\n\nYou can falsely shout fire in a theater, but you can only cause a panic in me if you have any credibility with me (Dick Cheney, George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and 9/11 spring to mind).\n\n![cheney_bush_rumsfeld.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_93_cheney_bush_rumsfeld.jpeg)\n\nFear, like it's physical expression, aggression, is not a sound foundation for a free society. It can never be completely eliminated, it must be managed. The best way to manage fear is understanding. Understanding comes from communication and communication, for humans, comes from free speech.\n\nFree speech, like many other issues, will be used in form by Statists to deceive their way to popularity and abused in substance like the title Statist publication, among many others, is doing. E.g.\n\n![45_minutes_from_attack.jpeg (196x258)](data/img/post_93_45_minutes_from_attack.jpeg)\n\nIn the context of this relatively high stakes political drama called Brexit terms such as the 'Capitulation Act' don't even approach disgusting. At any level attempting to confine debate by characterizing such innocuous phrases as 'tasteless' actually reveals where so many of the real problems may originate. The fear of anyone to actually exercise free speech in their attempts to play the game by Statist rules ([one of which is to never question the sanctity of the pantomime](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-defends-prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-comments-a9078171.html)).\n\nAs I have mentioned before one reason we have the Royal Family is to serve as a Statist 'little red book' of accepted behavior for everyone to follow. If you only ever said what is acceptable to the Queen over tea, you would never say anything at all (job done).\n\n![trump_with_queen.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_93_trump_with_queen.jpeg)\n\nAs I've also said before, Boris Johnson, either consciously or otherwise, is being set up to demonstrate the 'unacceptability' of 'populism' (a familiar theme elsewhere). The UK may stagger out of Statist clutches of the EU in form, but it will be much to the chagrin of the Statists both within the UK and beyond who are predominately 'remainers' at heart. They will be keen to interpret 'lessons learnt' from Brexit in such a way that it ultimately supports the Statist impulse for centralization and control. That's if current events don't indeed result in a Humiliation/Capitulation Act, as they well might.\n\nOnce the dust settles we will still be left with a State. A little bit of Statism is no better than a little bit of slavery. Both are morally flawed. Not least because of the impulses against freedom (of which free speech is a vital part) that both imply.\n\n![frederick_douglass.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_93_frederick_douglass.jpeg)\n\n(Frederick Douglass)\n\n'Trivial' appearing headlines like this can in one sense help us to understand how politically impoverished we have become but, in another, will continue to help us appreciate the fundamental issues long after Brexit has blown over.\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

It is no revelation that Statists will squabble and fight for the reins of power and some may represent more dangerous symptoms than others. But that's all they ever are. Reflections of ourselves. If you don't like what you see in the mirror I suggest you spend less time focusing on the reflections and more on yourself and how your own life corresponds to _your own_ values.\n\nThat way we can prepare for Statism, in all it's forms, when it inevitably comes knocking, uninvited, on the door.\n\n![waco.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_92_waco.jpeg)\n\nWaco, Texas\n\nConfronting the State on it's own, violent, terms, is dangerous.

The manipulator's tool. Along with fear, a favorite. With 'climate change' we have a powerful combination of the two. Delivering the message via an innocent young child makes for a neat package. She doesn't know that she's there because they want her there. She doesn't know that the louder she screams and jumps up and down the more they will applaud. She doesn't know that she's being used to deliver their message. It's so obvious even a child could work it out. One who's mind has somehow immunized itself against the constant, ubiquitous, worldwide propaganda of 'climate change' that follows children from the classroom to the television and everywhere in between. In other words very few.\nShe got one thing right \"I shouldn't be here. I should have been back at school\". Indeed, where she could, for example, study the [Children's Crusades of the Thirteenth century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Crusade) and how their pious idealism resulted, for many, in death or slavery. Fortunately, back then even Philip II wasn't so cynical, corrupt and desperate as to rely on the children as a vehicle for espousing pious, guilt inducing nonsense. He advised them to go back home.\n\n![childrens_crusade.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_91_childrens_crusade.jpeg)\n\nGreta shows us that despite the computers, airplanes and 'smart' phones etc. the broader population has actually become less politically astute. People will always be liable to manipulation due to those aspects of our nature that make us human. You cannot, and I obviously wouldn't ever want to, remove those attributes we all share, such as the empathy required in giving children space to speak despite appreciating the naivete and ignorance. But I suggest we regularly audit how they might be affecting our adult thought processes.\n\nThe ranting child hasn't yet learnt that the broader world doesn't really care about her at all. Her message is useful to the manipulators at the top who want to impart ideas that limit the growth and potential of ordinary people. That's how they get to stay on top. Persuading people to self-police so that their aspirations never develop to the point at which they may have the confidence and audacity to challenge the right of others to rule by decree rather than organize themselves through voluntary consent, in their own lives and out in open, free markets.\n\n![agorism_free_markets.png (225x225)](data/img/post_91_agorism_free_markets.png)\n\nPeople who claim the 'science is settled' are rarely aware of any scientists for whom the 'science' is far from settled. They are hardly ever mentioned in the mainstream media, of course. But can be found via YouTube if one's beliefs haven't been 'settled' by those of a 16 year old. Which scientist has proved the existence of \"irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.\" caused by human contributions to climate change? Please don't quote the IPCC (well, you can if you must), an institution purpose built by the [U.N. for the political manipulation of science](https://youtu.be/LOyBfihjQvI).\n\nLike most adults we face the parent's dilemma. Give her enough rope to hang herself, and her generation, on, or try to find a way to make her face the 'real world'. It usually ends up being a combination of the two, but the latter is clearly more humane in the end. In the meantime, I suggest, any adult that actually falls for any of this childish nonsense start reviewing some of the alternatives to the avalanche of propaganda seeping from every mainstream media pore around the globe currently.\n[Prof. Tim Ball](https://youtu.be/M1VJtER2IUE)\n[Dr. Patrick Moore](https://youtu.be/kHZKo13HV2A)\n\n[Dr. Judith Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Curry)\n\nhow this 'scientific consensus' really came about\n[Dr. Peter Ridd](https://youtu.be/QbKa015q4cI)\n\n[Prof. Bjorn Lomborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_Lomborg)\n\nand the human capacity for solutions (few children were involved in the making of this solution):\n[Thorium](https://youtu.be/ayIyiVua8cY)\n\nTalking about the weather has always been a useful social distraction when one has little else to say.

The absurd suggestion that U.S. citizens would inspect their own property because they suspect their own military is, in fact, a domestic enemy. Who is the 'enemy'? Everyone knows it's whoever your State says it is. The State doesn't need to be morally or even legally 'right' ultimately since it controls the man/firepower (which it buys with your (stolen) money).\n\n[This is what your money will buy](https://twitter.com/heathencandor/status/1175448798585327621/photo/1)\n\nBut threatening your own citizens makes it a little harder to hammer out the old 'we're doing it to protect you' lines. American citizens who have failed to take these threats seriously enough include Anwar al-Awlaki and his son 16-year-old Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.\n\n![Anwar_al-Awlaki.jpg (440x586)](data/img/post_90_Anwar_al-Awlaki.jpg)\n\nAnwar al-Awlaki\n\n![Abdulrahman_Al-Awlaki.png (216x300)](data/img/post_90_Abdulrahman_Al-Awlaki.png)\n\nAbdulrahman\n(I'm being unfair. I'm sure they took the threat very seriously)\n\nThe trick with coercion is to make it appear that the victim is willing, whilst actually both sides know they have no choice. The coercer gets angry if it has to overtly enforce it's power because that shows it up as the bully it really is and the true nature of the power relationship. A great deal of time and energy is spent, not least by politicians, attempting to construct a 'reality' in which these threats are implicit only. This is the basis of democracy. A useful (to Statists and their politicians) facade behind which they can attempt to hide their violence. It is what creates so many of those 'none so hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe themselves to be free' that inhabit our world under Statism.\n\nOne disadvantage these intrepid 'stormers' had was that they were completely exposed in the desert. How keen would anyone be to protest if, for example, the center of the HK protests was Area 51? That would take a brave soul indeed. In such a positon, I would take any threat by the Chinese State very seriously. Area 51 was probably cleared of any real military value some time ago (who knows?). Bombing it and taking out a few 'troublemakers' might only cause slightly more disturbance among the indoctrinated masses than the al-Awlaki episode did. Even if people were 'enraged', so what? What are they going to do about it? Appeal to the Constitution? That recourse blew out in the 19th Century with the likes of Marshall and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Very few, like Lysander Spooner, saw it all coming.\n\nManaging all this is a question of degree and PR. That's why the military has it's own PR dept., the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS). These guys decided they may have let the mask slip more than necessary. Everyone's going through a learning curve in the 'information age' and the military are, after all, only human. Sitting behind their monitors and eking out an existence that is entirely paid for by extortion they owe everything they have to the State that needs to look good on the outside and is same old on the inside.\n\nBombing innocent civilians is stock in trade for the Statists. From Dresden through Hiroshima to today's 'sophisticated' drone strikes what's important is moral self-delusion and a deep desire to be 'one of the crowd' and seek approval among your peers. Never questioning what the Master's say, no matter how obviously perverse it is.\n\nIt may appear like a 'joke' today, but everything about how the logical developments stemming from the the destruction of the Constitution, and more importantly the principles of individual autonomy that lie behind it, tell us that this really isn't so funny after all. If you object to the extortion and attempt to shake off your slave status, you will quickly understand that the State doesn't really 'joke about' at all.\n\n![joker.jpeg (311x162)](data/img/post_90_joker.jpeg)\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

The State is a sinister and crafty entity at the best of times but 'environmentalism' provides an excellent vehicle for selling the idea that humans are a problem to somehow be 'resolved'. The anti-humanism that lies at it's heart is one of the most dangerous of our times. It dovetails so well with Statist agendas for the modern age. It can be used to purportedly justify interfering with every nook and cranny of our existence. If you study history at all it becomes apparent that ordinary people are conditioned to often end up behind the curve when it comes to perceiving, anticipating and neutralizing dangerous ideas.\n\n![blair_election.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_89_blair_election.jpeg)\nA dangerous, lying [Jihardist]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad])\n\nAs the State twists and turns in it's attempts to distract, bait and switch between issues it can be hard to understand what's happening without considering basic positions (consider how the debate, in this instance, has changed from 'Global Warming' to 'Climate Change'). The State comes into existence, and sustains itself, by subordinating the interests of the individual to those of the State.\n\n![Stirner-on_the_state.png (327x154)](data/img/post_89_Stirner-on_the_state.png)\n\nAs an individual you are almost completely irrelevant to the State, unless you happen to say or do anything that interferes with it's processes of power and control accumulation. There is nothing overt to prevent you from absorbing and repeating it's propaganda regarding 'helping' and 'protecting' you. The only way is to reflect on what the foundations, and actual consequences, of it's ideas are. That information won't be served up, it has to be sought out. It's available today like never before.\n\nOf course, using children as a device for selling otherwise questionable ideas is not new.\n\n![hitler_youth.jpeg (200x252)](data/img/post_89_hitler_youth.jpeg)\n\nthis doesn't always work out so well for the children involved either:\n\n[Stalin - 'The Children's Friend'](https://www.rbth.com/history/328538-stalin-children-gelya-markizova)\n\nand to bring it up to date\n\n![trump_kissing_children.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_89_trump_kissing_children.jpeg)\n\nWhat kind of monster would attack an innocent little girl? A young girl who asks you not to listen to her because she is a child, but because she wants you to appreciate the 'science':\n\n“I am submitting this report as my testimony because I don’t want you to listen to me,” she wrote. ”I want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take action.\"\n\nListening to scientists, and only scientists (and young children), is unwise to say the least when it comes to the social and political.\n\n![von_braun.jpeg (309x163)](data/img/post_89_von_braun.jpeg)\n\nVon Braun\nExtremely capable people, but **not** necessarily at perceiving the bigger picture and Man's place in it.\n\nA great deal of science depends directly or indirectly on the largess of the State. An empathy with the State and it's objectives is baked into the DNA of science in a symbiotic relationship. The genuinely successful individual scientist, working and funded alone, is rare indeed.\n\n![marie_curie.jpeg (292x173)](data/img/post_89_marie_curie.jpeg)\n\nMarie Curie\n\nOne thing that a focus on children and scientists reveals is that the advocates of this position are keen to narrow the debate to these two spheres.\n\n\"Co-sponsor of the green new deal bill, Ed Markey, told the activist: “We need your leadership. Young people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before, and that is creating a new X factor.”\n\nWhy is that? What, for example, are the economic consequences for ordinary people of switching from nuclear to wind energy? To what extent is personal autonomy and freedom affected by giving up a family car to take public transport? What are the practical realities of riding a bicycle to work instead of driving? Is there a Statist advocate who will declare 'I want you to have to pay considerably more for you daily essentials', 'I want to give up your freedom' or 'I want you to arrive at work exhausted, sweating and filthy from rain and mud'. It's never sold that way despite these, and other aspects, being real world consequences of such ideas.\n\nThe debate on the science itself could quickly become complex and specialized. As it does the children will rapidly disappear, but that will be quietly forgotten. If you haven't researched any alternatives to the Statist's narrative on 'Global Warming' yet then now might be a good time to start. No-one will help you.\n\nThere are some troubling aspects to how far this child is managing to cast her dark, anti-human philosophy and the extent to which she's being enabled to do it.\n\"Perhaps surprised by the bluntness of Thunberg’s accusation that they were not doing enough to address the climate crisis, some politicians reportedly laughed while others applauded\"\n\nWhilst we'd expect notorious Statists like Obama to take a front seat in this bandwagon, I find it disturbing (but perhaps not surprising) that the entire Senate didn't laugh out loud and dismiss her as a ... well ... child. But it is logical. This Statist institution that abandoned any real adherence to it's founding principles a long time ago has an instinct for survival. The ones who didn't laugh will have the last laugh ... unless this farce can be taken more seriously than might appear necessary simply because she is 'just a child'.\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

The essence of human conflict. What makes me/you 'right'? Remove the unique human capacity for contemplating the world outside of our own immediate wants and needs and you're left with a power relation. One of the most pervasive aspects of that power relation is physical violence. There are others, like the desire for social recognition, approval, inclusion etc. But when the subtleties subside we're left, like every other natural phenomenon, with violence as the final arbiter. It is the worst, lowest form of arbitration, and it is one over which the State tends to seek full control, as it is what brings the State into existence and sustains it.\n\n![cromwell.jpeg (276x182)](data/img/post_88_cromwell.jpeg)\n\nSo what are people actually doing when they make a 'demand' of the State? What actually happens is what we've seen in the headlines during our lives and which continue to this day. Hong Kong, France and here, Sudan. There are many others of course. When people 'take to the streets' they are taking a lot of risks and creating a lot of dependencies for themselves and, quite possibly, others around them. Caging terms for 'riot' and 'unlawful assembly' can be for many years. They will have to beg the State for forgiveness if they want to reduce their sentences. Such treatment is especially reserved for those who cherish freedom more than most. It's a curious mix of PR, appeal to the 'conscience' of the State and violence. On all three counts the 'People' are at a huge disadvantage. PR is managed by the media in their own State and abroad.\n\n![cnn_demand.jpeg (284x177)](data/img/post_88_cnn_demand.jpeg)\nThe media's role is predominately one that re-enforces the 'righteousness' of the State. Appeal to the conscience of the State makes about as much sense as appealing to the 'conscience' of any extortion racket ... not much.\n\n![godfather.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_88_godfather.jpeg)\nLastly, the most pointless of all, resorting to the language of the State, which is violence.\n\n![violent_protesters.jpeg (274x184)](data/img/post_88_violent_protesters.jpeg)\n\nDriven to it by 'desperation' they may claim. But 'desperation' can also be a motivator to seek out and contemplate completely new ways of understanding the world. How to focus one's energy?\n\nBy making 'demands' of the State they are picking up the 3 'weapons' the State has chosen for them and left the most important one's on the shelf. The important one's are the ability to withdraw consent/co-operation\n\n![no_tax.jpeg (179x135)](data/img/post_88_no_tax.jpeg)\n\nand the dissemination of ideas that work for everyone (which means having the ability to make your own judgments).\n\n![who_judge.jpeg (327x154)](data/img/post_88_who_judge.jpeg)\nYou do ... that's a powerful idea and, so far, it hasn't cost me, comfortably sitting behind my computer, my life. Unless the State finds a way to overcome this weapon ... and it obviously tries very hard to do so ... I am fortunate enough to be able to continue ... for now ...\n\nNot so the 87+ slain by the State in Sudan. I didn't know these people. I don't know anyone from Sudan. I expect they were looking for the same things that the majority of humanity looks for, most the time ... peace, prosperity, freedom etc. They had enormous courage and made the ultimate sacrifice (no medals and parades here).\n\n![military_honours.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_88_military_honours.jpeg)\n\nWhat have they died for?\n\n\"The protesters called for the appointment of a new head of the judiciary and a new public prosecutor\". Presumably people who's judgement they believe better reflects their own values. However, if they are so in tune with their own values and beliefs why appoint someone else to reflect them? If 'the People' know best, then why don't 'the People' use their own judgement in their daily lives to manage the world around them in a way that reflects their values like peace and prosperity? Confronted with such a question the 'People', in my experience, will start referring to how the problem is not their own personal judgement but that of other 'People'. As the debate progresses they go on to reconstruct a new State in their mind, which is not surprising since it is all they, and almost everyone, has ever known.\n\n![the_eternal_state.jpeg (188x267)](data/img/post_88_the_eternal_state.jpeg)\n\nThis is why their demands for 'justice' for the deaths of their courageous fellow protesters might ultimately be somewhat in vain. For sure some scapegoats might be sacrificed to consolidate the 'new' State but it will be virtually indistinguishable from the 'old' State in daily life, and very little will actually have changed. At some point, perhaps after a few years, a younger generation will grow up and start to appreciate what's happened. 'Nothing's really changed!' they will cry. How will they respond? Let's hope it is with something a little more substantial than playing the State's game and 'taking to the streets'. It doesn't matter how 'developed' a nation is if it's ultimate aim is to render the vast majority of people totally powerless and enslaved\n\n![china_surveilance.jpeg (318x159)](data/img/post_88_china_surveilance.jpeg)\n\nafter all, isn't that what these protesters really died for?\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

			"body": "[Original Feed](https://www.newsnow.co.uk/h/Hot+Topics/9~11+Anniversary)\n\nThere's something missing from the news aggregator mentioned above. 9/11 conspiracy theories. They don't appear in the MSM and are not brought up even by 'hostile' regimes like Iran. [Has the weight of evidence lessened over time?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories)\n\n[Have the many eye witnesses to pre-collision explosions in the building basements all suddenly decided that they 'must have just been hearing things'?](https://youtu.be/irNqB5N0o30)\n\nWhat the plotters of the 9/11 narrative knew, because they have seen it many times before, is that people tend to pander to the Statist within. If 9/11 was exactly what we're told it was, everything, no matter how terrible it may be, at least makes sense. That means we don't have to look 'weird' to the people in our lives - friends, family, partners, colleagues, associates, clients etc. We can be 'normal' - fit neatly into the pack where there's little chance of being singled out, isolated and prevented from leading a comfortable life.\n\n![dianna_conspiracy_headline.jpeg (198x254)](data/img/post_87_dianna_conspiracy_headline.jpeg)\n\n'Royalty' always shows us how it's done\n\nDespite all the self-help books and 'inspiring' figures out there imploring us to 'dare to be different', it's a difficult natural barrier to transgress and it never gets easy. 'In time the truth will come out' is a popular platitude, but, with the lure of 'normality' constantly tugging at the inner soul, this isn't necessarily the case at all. There is a lot of evidence but [little enthusiasm for any of it to be explored and little resistance to it's censorship.](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12198090)\n\nThis makes sense from an Agorist perspective. The State conditions it's subjects from birth registration to death to follow it's narratives. Everything it does is designed to ensure that extortion appears as a timeless and natural process that cannot be avoided, no matter how much some 'dreamers' may wish to think otherwise.\n\n![overworked_child.jpeg (287x175)](data/img/post_87_overworked_child.jpeg)\n\nOnce those ideas are firmly embedded the 'growing' mind learns that the less time and energy spent questioning the extortion and the more spent becoming, in some way, an integral part of it, is what gets rewarded by Society.\n\n![jimmy_saville.jpeg (209x241)](data/img/post_87_jimmy_saville.jpeg)\n\nActual reality then has little to do with anything that matters on a daily basis to 'normal' people. This was most succinctly summed up by Noam Chomsky when asked about 9/11 - he replied 'so what?'. Quite striking from a figure that is held up as the epicenter of thoughtful resistance to the State by many (perhaps only the 'normal'[?]).\n\n![chomsky_rebel.jpeg (182x268)](data/img/post_87_chomsky_rebel.jpeg)\n\nSo what indeed? What does 9/11 mean to any of us now? Nothing has changed. Those who questioned the State after 9/11 are the same ones who did so before 9/11 (perhaps a few converts both ways), for the same reasons - an appreciation for the relations of power in Society and how they manifest themselves. The Founding Fathers understood these dynamics. Surveying the political landscape after their departure they would, I suggest, conclude that 9/11 is a natural, unsurprising and logical part of how they would expect freedom to be undermined in that geographical region they call the U.S. Just a false flag operation. [They had them then, so why wouldn't they have them now?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#Russo-Swedish_War)\n\nWhat matters is the Will to resist. You can write down 'protections' on a piece of paper but without that Will they become worse than useless, providing a cover from which Statists can claim 'legitimacy' whilst actually extending the plunder, power and control.\n\n> The Supreme Court has identified some categories of unprotected and less protected speech where the government has more latitude to regulate than usual under the First Amendment.\n> \n> Incitement of illegal activity – advocates illegal acts or the overthrow of the government (Schenck v. United States)\n> \n> Fighting words – speech that is directed at another and likely to provoke a violent response (Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire)\n> \n> Obscenity – material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to the indecent interest (Miller v. California)\n> \n> Commercial speech – expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience. (Central Hudson. v. Public Service Commission)\n> \n> Defamatory speech –speech that is injures reputation (New York Times Co. v. Sullivan)\n> \n> Symbolic speech – conduct that communicates through symbols (such as flag burning) rather than words (United States v. O’Brien)\n\nThe idea of free speech is vastly more important than any of these trivial justifications. The World we live in today is a living testimony to how successfully 'Supreme Court' cases like the ones above have undermined freedom and everything that flows from it (consider how much has been spent on post 9/11 wars for example). Anyone who wants to confront reality on 9/11, or many other political matters, is going to have to confront the inner Statist that tells them that violent coercion is a normal and natural part of life. That has emotional and psychological consequences that few have been prepared for.\n\n![royal_family_together.jpeg (309x163)](data/img/post_87_royal_family_together.jpeg)\nHow it's supposed to be - if you are 'normal'\n\nLoneliness and isolation are not rewards. Coming to understand the World for what it really is, warts and all, and thinking about ways to improve it are, but in a rather different way. Not so much comfort and pleasure as a kind of satisfaction. That may or may not be worthwhile to you, but I often have to remind myself that nothing worthwhile comes easily ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

As such he has always been a good Statist. The 'bizarre' element comes from the fact that Trump got himself elected by openly supporting, and surrounding himself with, men like Bolton. Many people like their Statism toned down, so that it's hypocrisy and ruthlessness, isn't, at least on the surface, quite so blatant. But then it's easy to forget how weary the public had become of the faux liberalism embodied in characters like Obama, Hilary Clinton et al.\n\n![obama_hilary.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_86_obama_hilary.jpeg)\nThis, sadly, is what was so 'refreshing' about Trump's appearance on the political scene. Not that he was going to get to grips with the lies and deceit at the heart of the 'Swamp', but that he was going to proudly declare the 'Swamp' as something to aspire to and the creatures in it, like himself, as people to follow. Whilst that approach appealed in the short term as an antidote to the 'Obama/Hilary' effect it's been wearing thin as his tenure unfolds. People realize again that the Swamp is still actually a Swamp. Their Swamp in fact and it's starting to get a little embarrassing. Time for a makeover.\n\n![extreme_makeover.jpeg (307x164)](data/img/post_86_extreme_makeover.jpeg)\n\nSoon a new Swamp monster will appear. Somewhat smoother, somewhat more 'reasonable', slightly less mustachiod perhaps. Someone who can make the Swamp Monster in Chief look good. But underneath all the makeup it'll be the same old Statism working away to increase it's power relative to ours. It's not a pleasant thing to wake up next to ... we can either find a way to live with the lies or call them out for what they are ... genuine choice is at the heart of freedom ... and we'll never have it as long as these characters (however shiny their suits and 'Presidential' they appear) are holding a gun to our heads ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

There is his own journey from 'disciplined', as is often the case, Jesuit, education, through radical activism to, finally, 'corruption'. There is the way this journey is viewed and interpreted by all the other Statists throughout his life and also now that he is dead. It's a familiar story and one that, in essence, can be applied to most, if not all, 'successful' Statists. Emotionally cold formative years, a strong intellect, a growing interest in politics and the welfare of the 'Nation', an ability to turn on the charm when required. All the Statists will pick and choose those interpretations of Mugabe, through the various stages, in accordance with their own narrative at a particular time. It's relatively easy to survey the life of Mugabe and judge. But who's considered the Mugabes among us now and the Mugabe within? Mugabe was corrupt. So are we all. The 'evil' comes from abandoning one's own judgement for the sake of someone who appears to be a useful repository for many of the responsibilities I suggest we may carry ourselves. Someone who will 'protect' us, someone who will 'save us from the oppressor', someone who provides a 'moral compass'.\n\n![robert_mugabe.jpg (440x291)](data/img/post_84_robert_mugabe.jpg)\n\nTo quote Mugabe himself:\n'An evil remains an evil whether practiced by white against black or black against white.' in 1980.\n\nBy 1998 this had become:\n\"strike fear in the hearts of the white man, our real enemy\"\n\nSimply noting that a politician is a dangerous liar and hypocrite, provides little to zero insight. The mistake is ever being taken in by the blustering proclamations of a power seeking Statist at a time and in a context when it appears to fit our own agenda. The Statists involved with Mugabe in the machinations of the State, like Lord Carrington, for example, will simultaneously apologize for and condemn him, being careful to be consistent with their own worldview, which is always that others should, at some point, abandon their own judgement and follow a 'leader'.\n\n\"As late as 1988 Carrington wrote he had been fortified by Mugabe’s magnanimity and intelligence, seemingly unaware of the slaughters Mugabe instigated in his political rival’s power base, the two Matabeleland provinces of eastern Zimbabwe, from 1982 to 1987.\" source: [Guardian newpaper](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/07/how-uk-foreign-policy-effort-to-dislodge-mugabe-ended-in-failure-zimbabwe)\n\n![Lord_Carrington.jpg (440x804)](data/img/post_84_Lord_Carrington.jpg)\n\nMugabe didn't carry out the massacre of over 20,000 black Ndebele civilians in the Gukarakundi ... his followers did. Ask any follower why he harms others in accordance with the orders of his 'leader' and you will hear a litany of familiar phrases that have echoed throughout history. 'Respect for the leader', a 'higher purpose', 'one Nation', 'unity', a better future, some kind of 'greatness'. A 'better future' may be a good idea, but I suggest that physically harming others on the orders of a 'dear Leader' has a very poor record as an approach to the problem. It may be true that in a particular context it is difficult to convince 'simple' people of these things, but how many politicians even begin to try? 'Follow me' or 'take responsibility for your own judgement'? Of course, the cunning one's will manage a subtle combination of the two that ultimately amounts to 'follow me'.\n\nHow would you have felt, if, as a member of the British armed forces, you received the order to invade Zimbabwe?\n\n'British prime minister Tony Blair had an antagonistic relationship with Mugabe and allegedly planned regime change in Zimbabwe' - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe).\n\nOf course, this 'fact' will be disputed. I mention it to illustrate how conflicting and inconsistent the World can appear without understanding the nature of Statism and Statists everywhere. [Recourse to violent coercion is never far from the politician's heart and soul, wherever they hail from](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/5373525/Tony-Blair-believed-God-wanted-him-to-go-to-war-to-fight-evil-claims-his-mentor.html).\n\n![crusader_blair.jpg (460x296)](data/img/post_84_crusader_blair.jpg)\n\nConsidering the Statists of the past or the present, nothing will change unless we see the dynamic of Statism unfolding throughout our own societies and lives. By being such a blatant example of the disingenuous nature of all politicians, Mugabe may actually have done some good. It's all a question of how _you_ interpret it ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

In law duress can make a contract void or voidable for similar reasons. Statists know that their power to control a disproportionate number of people comes from the threat of violence (coercion). Their power is diminished by the use of actual violence although it is necessary at times to make the threats credible. They have a huge imbalance of power in their favor through their monopoly on violence, control of weapons and plundered loot to pay for manpower. These realities combined means they like to pretend they are having a 'conversation', 'dialogue' (in places like Parliaments) or whatever euphemism of the day is in the particular Statist territory. The more draconian the concessions the negotiator can extract from his target as a result of the imbalance of power the greater the incentive to make those concessions appear to have been the result of a 'fair and balanced dialogue'. When the draconian measures are carried out a great deal of potential opposition can then be neutralized by the simple refrain that 'it's what you consented to'.\n\n![corcion.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_82_corcion.jpeg)\n\nWhat has really just happened in HK? A 'victory' for the Commoners? Over 1000 facing fines and/or being caged, some after having been beaten. The article, from a mainstream news conglomerate, is replete with Statist slants - Freedom is 'enjoyed' in HK in a way that equates it with something like a trip to DisneyLand.\n\n![disneyland_HK.jpeg (255x198)](data/img/post_82_disneyland_HK.jpeg)\n\n'Many are furious at perceived police brutality' ... but there's no 'perceived' qualifier for the 'pitched battles' by those who 'drove the former British colony to the edge of anarchy'; using, as ever, the term 'anarchy' in the pejorative sense that the mainstream media ensures the public understands it to mean i.e. chaos.\n\n![chaos.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_82_chaos.jpeg)\n\nInstead of what it really means which is simply 'leaderless'.\n\nBy 'too late' what is meant is that Carrie Lam's gang should have withdrawn this bill at a much earlier stage, perhaps when the protests with large numbers were predominantly peaceful? People can, and perhaps will, endlessly debate what constitutes the 'right' moment for a politician like Lam to do such a thing. All these debates miss the point, which is that any 'dialogue/conversation' etc. that takes place between the State and it's antagonists does so under the shadow of violent coercion.\n\nPeople 'taking to the streets' is an absurd way to carry on. I appreciate they are forced into it out of sheer desperation, however any 'victory' forged in this fashion is hollow. It sets the precedent that every time anyone wants to 'negotiate' with the State they must spend months out of a busy and demanding life, hanging about in all kinds of weather, with the prospect of being violently assaulted/caged ever present and the very real chance that whatever issue it is they are campaigning for will not be 'heard' at the end of it all. That millions do this is a testament to human Will. However, I suggest a little more of that Will be spent examining the true nature of the relations that exist in society and a little less time wasted making your cause appear like one of a disorganized rabble that is then characterized as 'the edge of Anarchy' by mainstream media conglomerates that have vested interests in the State and all of it's machinations.\n\n![hk_chaos.jpeg (284x177)](data/img/post_82_hk_chaos.jpeg)\n\nPeople with a point to make can do so online, in their conversations with those around and by organizing their own lives to be consistent with the values they purport to espouse. Don't agree with the violent coercion of the State and/or being shipped out to an even more draconian State? Why stamp a seal of approval on the idea that violent coercion be used against others implicit in a vote?\n\n![dontvote.png (224x225)](data/img/post_82_dontvote.png)\n\nA seeming Statist concession, because violence and chaos were threatened, plays right into their hands. This is playing their game, by their rules. Thank goodness the 'leaders' are level headed and reasonable negotiators. They have decided not to brutally suppress the population with their instruments of destruction. The next step is returning to the 'negotiating table' and starting all over again. People will have to be prepared to continually march out onto the streets for some long, wet days. At the end of it all very little will have changed ... just the way the State likes it as it continues to probe for new avenues of control ...\n\n![internet_control_china.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_82_internet_control_china.jpeg)\n\nshaping young minds for example ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

An opportunity to re-enforce it's propaganda among it's own population and a threat in that some aspect of the individual's existence may go counter to the official narratives.\n\n![opportunity_and_threat.jpeg (279x180)](data/img/post_80_opportunity_and_threat.jpeg)​​​​​​​\n\n'Begpackers' are ordinary people who are doing something the State doesn't like. They are living in a relatively independent fashion. In each containerized State the people within it may have been programmed to believe that their State is somehow special. That being subjugated and extorted from has a particular character and local flavor accompanied by values that aren't held elsewhere. It's true that diverse cultural psychological coping mechanisms do exist, but the underlying reality behind all the diversity is remarkably consistent. Few societies are extortion free.\n\n![taxes_they_take.jpeg (252x200)](data/img/post_80_taxes_they_take.jpeg)\n\nWhat people in South East Asia don't understand about the West is that the wealth that they so much admire is generated as a function of freedom, not oppression. Aligning with the narratives of the freedom sapping machine that feeds off that wealth we call the State may win short term favour, enriching, for example, the Government contractor and it's employees, but ultimately the schism between personal aspirations of the individual and those mandated by the State becomes so wide that wealth creation (the root of the tree) starts to deteriorate and die. It becomes a better option for the individual to live outside the regulated and distorted productive world that the State carefully controls to it's own advantage. Parasitism off the productive forces is the lifeblood of the State. The idea that anyone should/could/can live in such a way is dangerous indeed to the State.\n\n![bank_bail-in.jpg (417x464)](data/img/post_80_bank_bail-in.jpg)\n\nThe title headline, on a seemingly relatively trivial issue, has some deep implications. The State has to hope that it's population has been adequately programmed to come to the conclusions they have been set-up up to come to. If they are 'enraged' at such behavior it is relatively easy for the State to respond to the 'Will of the People' by introducing yet more legislation/regulation/bye-laws etc. to make the lives of these relatively free souls just that little bit harder than they already are.\n\nSince the mainstream media in all States are simply propaganda vehicles for the State we can expect to see stories that highlight those 'begpackers' that cause the most outrage and frustration among local populations so that the State can introduce it's measures without appearing to be freedom hating. The option of saying 'no' to the State is not one that it wishes to make easy. Many of these begpackers will be painfully aware of this from their lives in their 'own' State and, in fact, their begpacking may well be part of an attempt to discover if there is greater freedom to be found elsewhere in the World. Sadly they find that Statism's' roots go deep in every society and they are about as welcome in the new one as they were in the old, albeit with the value systems somewhat rearranged on the surface.\n\n![begpackers.jpg (1200x800)](data/img/post_80_begpackers.jpg)\n\nThere is one aspect of the begpacking that the State would approve of although it wouldn't admit it openly. Begging lies at the heart of how the State functions. Once you have been extorted the State expects you to coming begging back to it for it's benevolent consideration. In it's narrative to the media the State may well purport to dislike this 'begging' dimension of the issue. But please consider how the State actually behaves in relation to it's own population and you start to understand the source of the cognitive dissonance that the sight of 'wealthy' Westerners engenders in the populations of South East Asia.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRYbYlgejX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRYbYlgejX0)\n\nThe State is adept at feeding off the anger, that it helps to create, in it's perpetual cycle to accumulate more power and control. Peaceful people who live outside it's narratives can generate this anger if they are not properly understood. I suggest we all look in the mirror and ask ourselves how much begging we're engaged in and to what extent do we all long for a life outside of the tightly controlled dictates of the State, in all it's forms.\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

This is a threat. The wannabee wants what the 'Queen' has - the power to extort. Since any State will educate it's population to view violent extortion as a natural and inevitable phenomenon, it takes a great deal of de-programming for any individual to realize that everything in their World, including any kind of political aspiration to 'improve it', is conditioned upon this principle.\n\n![unplug_from_the_matrix.jpeg (299x169)](data/img/post_79_unplug_from_the_matrix.jpeg)\n\nIt is this principle which is the source of all contemporary political problems.

is the argument promulgated by Hobbes in Leviathan. He held up the prospect of a 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short' life without such 'stability'. His 'evidence' for this proposition appears to have been primarily his experiences of the English Civil War. Perhaps if he had the benefit of hindsight he could have considered the lives of children in famine induced Soviet Ukraine, the innocent civilians of Hiroshima and the young men slaughtered in all the wars of the 20/21st century.\n\n![young_men_at_war.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_79_young_men_at_war.jpeg)​​​​​​​\n\nThe idea that 'stability' is derived from institutions of the State such as the Monarchy or Parliament is based on a faulty assumption. History has demonstrated that they can just as easily be the source of massive instability. The interpretation entirely depends on which end of the violence you happen to be sitting. Unfortunately history is written by the 'winners', who become the next kings of the anthill:\n\n![leviathan.jpeg (231x218)](data/img/post_79_leviathan.jpeg)\n\nHobbes articulates an old Statist favorite:\n\"he that complaineth of injury from his sovereign complaineth that whereof he himself is the author, and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himself, no nor himself of injury because to do injury to one's self is impossible\".\nIn other words 'you signed up for the State, if the State takes all your property and kills you, you did it to yourself'. What we find is that from birth to death we are signed up to the State in various forms of 'registration'. Try divesting yourself of all these 'registrations' and you will have a difficult life.\n\n![birth_register.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_79_birth_register.jpeg)\n\nYou will hear this Statist position of, essentially, 'the beating will continue until morale improves' trotted out over Brexit, Hong Kong, Kashmir and all of the past and current 'areas of tension' (people seeing through the hypocrisy and attempting to do something about it). Where the State 'triumphs' through violence it will justify it by recourse to this absurd, State serving, line of reasoning.\n\n![beatings_will_continue.jpeg (183x275)](data/img/post_79_beatings_will_continue.jpeg)\n\nSo it is hardly surprising that the 'Queen' will attempt to remove herself, once again, further from the fray, despite actually sitting in the middle of it. She, along with her Statist minions, whoever that ends up being, will wait for the betrayal of the people to occur and then simply point out that 'you did it to yourselves', it is what you deserve for being 'troublemakers' who don't sign up for the 'stability' the State provides. The 'solution' is conformity and the essence of conformity is the acceptance of the principle of extortion as a 'good', for the 'benefit of all'.\n\n![golden_ring_and_triangle.jpeg (222x227)](data/img/post_79_golden_ring_and_triangle.jpeg)\n\nIf you see through all this no 'golden triangle' or any other kind of political device, or secret society structure, will preserve the extortionists distorted positions; not for the 'Queen' or any of the other aspirants over the control of your life."

			"date_published": 1567057766.389,
			"body": "Original:\n[The Queen Approved Boris Johnson's Plan to Dissolve the British Parliament by October 14th](https://www.novinite.com/articles/199778/The+Queen+Approved+Boris+Johnson%27s+Plan+to+Dissolve+the+British+Parliament+by+October+14th)\n\nIf you buy into the lies it appears complex. Step back, understand that these are professional con artists, see what they get up to, ignore them completely in your own actions and get on with your life. Of course, it's not that simple because so many people buy into the multi layered con tricks (history, economics, politics etc.) that there's a vast [supply of minions ready to carry out the State's bidding](https://www.ft.com/content/13012836-86ad-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2) and interfere with any non-State activity you may indulge in to improve the quality of your life.\n\nThe logic of the State is to gradually centralize power, away from ordinary people and into it's own, vast, impersonal hands. The politicians will dance around this simple reality because it has terrible consequences for the people who accede to the process and from whom the politicians believe they derive their power. The State is looking for a way to turn a potential disaster, ordinary people having more power and control over their lives, into an opportunity to amass more actual power for itself whilst selling it as a great step forward for 'freedom'. May tried and failed. Too obvious. Now we have Boris.\n\n![boris_and_union_jack.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_78_boris_and_union_jack.jpeg)\n\nBoris is the champion of the People. Courageously standing up to the arrogant might of the European bureaucrats. A plucky Churchillian ready to save the nation in it's hour of darkness etc. etc. Like Churchill this servant is well placed to stab the people in the back. So well placed that few will realize, in the ensuing confusion, how the fallout suits the objectives of the State. Boris is a Trojan Horse.\n\nJust as the Second World War was a disaster for freedom and democracy, so will it be with Brexit.\n\n![Dresden.jpeg (277x182)](data/img/post_78_Dresden.jpeg)\n\n(Dresden)\n\n![hiroshima.jpeg (318x159)](data/img/post_78_hiroshima.jpeg)\n\n(Hiroshima)\n\n![iron_curtain.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_78_iron_curtain.jpeg)\n\n('Liberating Europe')\n\nNot because ordinary people didn't have the right instinct in wanting to escape the EU, but because any political process, managed through the institutions of the State, can be manipulated into whatever best suits the interests of the State (which is not your freedom).\n\n![state_vs_freedom.jpeg (265x190)](data/img/post_78_state_vs_freedom.jpeg)\n\nReferences to the interests of the 'Commoners' is a necessary inconvenience to the State. Necessary because without it the relations of power are too easy to perceive. I'm not a supporter of these institutions because of their ability to cloud these relations. However, since they are the only avenue currently whereby any recognition of ordinary people's political perspectives exist, suspending even this fig-leaf is **ominous**. If Boris is the champion of the People why does he need to cut off this feeble channel? If you swallow the argument that in extraordinary times, extraordinary measures are required etc. you have taken the bait. It is the old Statist argument used to justify dropping any pretense at a concern for the 'interests of the people', often used in times of war etc. If you fall for this how can you respond when Boris emerges out of some 'special' meeting with EU leaders with a compromise deal that ensures the State extends it's power at the expense of the many, with a thin veneer of ultimately meaningless emancipation?\n\n![boris_and_the_eu.jpeg (278x181)](data/img/post_78_boris_and_the_eu.jpeg)\n\nLike the results of WW2 it will be the worst of all possible outcomes having achieved nothing it proclaimed, but everything that suits the State's hidden agenda. If you support this move now and subsequently complain it's not as if you weren't prepared to ignore other's opinions and aspirations (however poorly mediated through Parliament) when it politically suited. You will have shot yourself in the foot to gain a Pyrrhic victory motivated by the (entirely laudable) desire for freedom. There is a principle at stake and Boris will drive a stake right through it.\n\nIn the aftermath, to ease the cognitive dissonance, we will be encouraged to not look too closely into the details of the 'deal' and lionize Boris as a 'savior of freedom and democracy', by our gas-lighting 'leaders'. We will be encouraged to do this by our fellow slaves as well, all anxious to apply a palliative to their own dissonance.\n\nThat's the plan. It's worked before and it has a good chance of working again. I urge you to see this for what it is ... but, as ever, it's _your_ judgment that counts ..."

Not if you're a 'citizen' of the country the Statist is currently preying on, obviously. Anything and everything they say will, ultimately, be designed to accumulate as much power centrally at your expense. But when the State that the Statist presides over is itself vulnerable and, for whatever reason, subject to malign influence and coercion from the others, the Statist will suddenly start coming out with a stream of logic reserved only for 'the Nation'. Suddenly 'Sovereignty' is under attack. Suddenly 'we don't need your help, we can manage alone'. Suddenly we are being insulted and undermined by the very suggestion that we need 'assistance'. Suddenly other States 'should stop meddling in our affairs' and so on.\n\nThe same line of thinking that, when confined to an individual within a State (for example an Agorist), is considered 'bizarre', 'irrelevant', 'unrealistic', 'irresponsible', 'selfish', 'stupid' etc. I would ask you to take a moment to really ponder this. This is why the logic of unfolding international affairs tells us that we are being drawn steadily, in fits and starts, towards a centralized international 'order'. Centralization of power is at the heart of the history of the World over the past decades (and perhaps for all time). Some people see it to a certain extent and balk at it, hence Brexit. But it touches on deeper issues than the predominately negative ones that many refer to such as immigration. In some ways it goes right to the heart of what it means to be free and autonomous. If you are 'weak', 'incapable' and isolated you would be 'crazy' to refuse offers of 'help'. A 'self-hater' bent on your own destruction. You need protection, whether you know/like it or not. Once you've accepted that idea you've opened the door to a whole world of manipulation and ultimately slavery (when you have no choices left).\n\nIt's a tricky one for the Statist. Every argument he's used to claw his way to the top of his own little ant hill is now dispensed with and reversed once he's reached the top and has to fend off his Statist rivals.\n\n![anthill.jpg.jpeg (246x205)](data/img/post_77_anthill.jpg.jpeg)\n\nOnce again the title article contains many references to these deeper issues, reflected within a topical event, which, like many these days, has the environmental element thrown in for it's gas lighting effects.\n\n![gaslighting.jpg (45x67)](data/img/post_77_gaslighting.jpg)\n\nHe fights back: \"The fake news campaign built against our sovereignty will not work.\"\n\nYou may, reasonably, point out that the article refers to Bolsonaro being 'open' to foreign aid. The details, however, see him playing the game. Balancing the competing interests in such a way that, hopefully for him, he can come out on top. Just as one would expect from a professional politician:\n\n'Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro is willing to accept foreign aid for fighting fires devastating the Amazon rain-forest, but only if the country controls the funds, his spokesman said Tuesday.'\n\nYes, indeed. 'Controlling the funds'. Imagine paying your taxes but getting to 'control the funds'. In other words, not paying your taxes.\n\nHe knows how to hit a politician where it hurts - his ego:\n\n'The announcement suggests Bolsonaro has dropped an earlier demand that French President Emmanuel Macron withdraw \"insults\" made against him before he would accept a G7 offer to help put out the fires in the world's largest rain-forest.' Whether this 'suggestion' is true or not, the swing has been taken. All the politicians know they can hide behind fighting talk to get at what they really want\n\n![aggressive_trump.jpeg (232x130)](data/img/post_77_aggressive_trump.jpeg)\n\nin this case the money, no strings attached, with the 'Nation's Sovereignty' in tact, with himself the Savior of it (and the Rain-forest) - a double whammy, if you can pull it off.\n\nHis domestic rival, is quick to wade in:\n\n'Bolivia's leftist President Evo Morales on Tuesday gave a halfhearted welcome to the G7 aid pledge, which he described as \"tiny.\"'\n\nHe can't give a 'whole hearted welcome' because he too wants the image of maintaining the 'Nation's Sovereignty', but his leftist bent means he also slips in that the amount is 'tiny'. He doesn't want to undermine the principle of forcibly taking and spending other people's money and to do that he needs to leverage on the idea that no amount 'from above' is ever enough.\n\n![money_from_above.jpeg (240x210)](data/img/post_77_money_from_above.jpeg)\nThe 'aid game' can be played at all levels and across large numbers of people or simply between two individuals. It's vast, complex, vague but affects all our lives in one form or another - a perfect incubator for the political class. It's relatively easy to perceive at the personal level where we all grow up (hopefully) and leave our parents. As the same issues permeate wider society it's not so easy to avoid getting caught up in the mists of 'experts', 'intellectuals' and politicians, all reinforced by the vested interest media barrage.\n\nIt's a jungle out there my friends. I suggest you use your own judgement, and some independent opinions, in your journey navigating it ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

It, and the other offshoots of Orwellian dystopia that have been spawned in recent decades, is rapidly fulfilling it's mission as the new mind control medium for the World (searching is a bug, we'll tell you what you want to know - trust us - we're 'Authority').\n\n![what_do_you_think.jpeg (221x228)](data/img/post_76_what_do_you_think.jpeg)​​​​​​​\n\nIt is quite apparent from the title link article that for me to work in such a place would be the willful abandonment of any pretension to individual autonomy. But the same could be said of a vast sway of corporations and even smaller businesses. I suggest each individual assess how much this autonomy means to them. Unlike Statists, I don't attempt to dictate what people should or should not do (unless they physically attack me). By extension why should I know any more than anyone else if one company or another is 'good' or 'bad' for them?\n\nWith such a culture that exists in Google, and with it out in the open, I would find it difficult to take any employee seriously if they mentioned anything outside of the narrowly technical sphere about which they spend most their time. I respect that they can choose to work for whomsoever they want. That doesn't mean I need to respect that choice.\n\nGoogle, like the State, can, and will, do whatever it wants until it is no longer kept alive from public funds and is forced to justify it's existence in the market alone. Regulation (asking the same people who kicked it off in the first place what to do) is not the answer. I believe it's given it's employees (some highly capable I expect) great reasons for leaving (and perhaps joining another firm that believes in little things like freedom?). That would be a more effective way to have 'their voices heard' than endless internal meetings attempting to ensure that 'everyone is respected' etc. It would also be 'giving back' in a rather more meaningful way than doing an early morning eco-cleanup in the park to 'show you care' or similar.\n\nComfort and stability have their price.

There are socially 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable' ways of getting it. The 'acceptable' usually involve some form of 'earning'. The 'unacceptable' are too easily acquired. What constitutes 'too easily acquired' might be the subject of much controversy, but suffice to say that drugs get straight to the reward, bypassing what may be required in, for example, sport or business.\n\nWhat I find fascinating about a film like 'Pulp Fiction' is that it functions as mirror on our own World. Seemingly exaggerated from the perspective of the ordinary person's life but, tragically real if you happen to be unfortunate enough to be caught up in the State's mechanisms of oppression.\n\nThe Gimp is a 'sub' in BDSM parlance. BDSM is defined as:\n\n'BDSM is a variety of often erotic practices or role playing involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics ... Activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of informed consent of both the partners is essential.'\n\nOne objection may be that the State is not an expression of anything 'erotic'. However, most States have extensive laws directing how sexual relations and the 'erotic' should be conducted. 'Often' implies not always, so activities outside the 'erotic' are, technically, covered. The 'erotic' is simply one path, among many, to a dopamine hit. Numerous laws regulate how such hits are achieved - via 'worthy' or 'unworthy' activities.\n\nHow often does the State attempt to characterize our relationship to it as 'consensual'? One of the major, and enduring, features of parliamentary democracy is the idea that it represents the 'Will of the People' so that the truly coercive nature of it's false dichotomy can be concealed. The Gimp was broken long ago and has forgotten how to say no. He may go along with the proceedings and even enjoy them; but there can be no doubt he is the 'sub' in this game.\n\nIt's time to come out of the closet and take off the mask ...\n\n![the_gimp.jpeg (333x151)](data/img/post_75_the_gimp.jpeg)"

Unnecessary to who? People who want to be free, or the State? The State needs to accumulate as many laws as possible so that whenever you do something that threatens it's power over you they can declare your activities illegal, rob and cage you to the applause of your fellow slaves. This can get so absurd that [it's possible to commit an illegal act in some States by NOT having sexual intercourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377A_of_the_Penal_Code_(Singapore).\n\nNoticing that the State has laws that it can potentially draw on but hasn't actually used is helpful to a degree, but misses the point; which is that we don't need any laws that come to us via the State at all. An extortion racket is not a sound foundation for the generation of anything 'good' and/or 'moral'. You and I may disagree, of course, on what constitutes 'good' etc. but I suggest that violent aggression isn't the best starting point (violent _defense_ could, potentially, be the only remaining option in certain circumstances, but that is the _end_, not the beginning, of the issue).\n\n'What we need is for people to understand the warning signs and for law enforcement to step up and actually investigate.'\n\nThis is a heavily loaded statement. Who is 'we'? 'What _I_ want' would be more accurate. If _you_ want something _pay_ for it. If you want people to go around investigating things - suspicions, likelihoods etc. pay them yourself and you can be happy, or not, with the results of your investigations. By doing so you will, at least, be stimulating the economy. Who knows, one of your investigations might actually turn up something important. In which case all the facts and evidence can be turned over to someone else, who again, must be paid, to take the matter further. Remember, of course, that if I, or anyone else, became too disturbed by all these busy body investigators (I have 'weapons' at home - a knife, a screwdriver, some spoons etc. and what many people consider a fairly 'extreme' set of political views), then I might pay to find ways to make it harder for your investigators to interfere in _my_ life. The difference is you get to choose what's important to you and pay for it. Not pay under the threat of violent coercion and retrospectively pretend that you have any control over the results; for example, by telling people what 'we need'.\n\nThe writer is confident that _he_ understands the warning signs. If that's true, which I personally doubt (but so what?) his targeted, well thought out and fully paid for investigations would, I suggest, be of great benefit to society. Detecting and neutralizing all those 'likely' mass shooters before they even knew they were a 'shooter' themselves.\n\n![terror_signs.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_74_terror_signs.jpeg)​​​​​​​\n\n(Spot the signs)\n\nBut, of course, he wants 'law enforcement' to do it for him. That's the 'law enforcement' that we're all forced to pay for whether we agree with anything they do or not. He wants them to 'step up and actually investigate', the implication being they're all lazy and stupid and require some 'leadership' to inspire them into 'doing the right thing'.\n\nFinally,\n\n'We’re just lucky other laws didn’t fail the people.'\n\nAll the laws have failed all the people. Not because of what they say, but because of where they came from. Busy body 'leaders' who think they know best what 'we' want and that they are the best judges of what is right and wrong, good and bad, likely or suspicious ... spot one of those and it's time to reach for the 'Red Flag' ...\n\n![red_flag.jpeg (251x201)](data/img/post_74_red_flag.jpeg)\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

People have always fought over it. Not surprising since if you can't exist on the land, you can't exist. It's an issue you can't just walk away from - literally. Whilst it may appear, and actually be, less contentious when it involves land with relatively low marginal utility the principle is the same - 'they ain't making any more of it' (ignoring reclamation etc. for the moment). The utility of land can suddenly change e.g. oil is discovered or, in this case, it's rather useful for conducting secret operations of one sort or another. Who determines what is done with any given piece of land? As with every other major political issue we have two sides fundamentally - the people and the State (not one kind of State vs another kind of State as Hobbes attempted to argue). Free market (you choose) or extortion racket (you get what you're given and you _will_ like it). We find elements of this deep division in this simple story. I therefore believe this potentially could be more important than it may at first appear with all the 'alien' confusion trivializing the issue.\n\nWho owns this land? The Government. Simple. Stupid question. Until you continue to ask 'well, who then is the 'Government'?'. If you break it down enough you'll simply end up with millions of individuals just like you and me who've sided with the extortion racket. A lot of the things they do, 'services', unfortunately in some instances, would anyway have to be done without a State. Wearing costumes and badges and walking/talking about with 'authority' is something privately hired security guards do as well. There's no point in getting worked up about that overt manifestation of power relations, no matter how obvious a target of your angst it may appear.\n\n![angry_protester.jpeg (269x187)](data/img/post_73_angry_protester.jpeg)\n\n(Minus the costumes this HK pic could be a scene from outside a nightclub)\n\nWhat's important is from where is that 'authority' derived? Via physical aggression ultimately. That can be mediated either from the people's choice mechanism (free markets) or via those 'who know what's best for you'. I would say 'you choose', but you don't get to. The choice is made for you from the day you are born. Voting abstinence is, of course, interpreted as _accepting_ either candidate, rather than _rejecting_ both/all candidates, which it is more likely to be. Accepting/rejecting is the _entire_ point, if you _reject_ that point you have _no_ legitimacy.\n\nWithout the option to reject, you are born into slavery. Giving up varying degrees of your value accumulation to the 'master' as you grow down through life. What to do about this is something that people are either forced to contemplate relatively consciously (e.g. in HK at the moment) (Orwell) or that is 'managed' throughout someone's life in a relatively unconscious fashion (Huxley). Either way it's there whether you recognize it or not.\n\nThese Area 51 'raiders' are recognizing it to a certain degree. The reason that so many others choose not to recognize the reality of our existence as slaves is that doing so makes the slavery so much more painful to bear. That's why one of the biggest barriers to emancipation is the other slaves (read [Frederick Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass) for more on this). The 'raiders' have a problem:\n\n\"Oh, we're taking this seriously,\" Lincoln County Commission Chairman Varlin Higbee told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nThis Statist understands what's at stake. If large hordes of ordinary people believe they can simply walk onto any government land, what's next? The Pentagon, the White House, Congress?\n\nand so the story logically unfolds ...\n\nThe State gets itself legally covered to escape responsibility for it's acts:\n\nEric Holt, county emergency manager, asked commissioners to \"pre-sign\" the emergency declaration.\n\nNext a revealing point that may appear like a simple truism:\n\n\"The county only has so much money to deal with\" (the State's Achilles Heel)\n\nand then, relatively honestly, admits to the power relations:\n\n\"We don't want civilian people in contact with the military at all. That will get ugly.\"\n\nNot 'might', but '_will_ get ugly'.\n\nAlthough it's all wrapped up in the usual 'you conform so we can protect you' facade that you would expect from any extortion racket:\n\n\"They have to have their security, medical, parking plans and few other things (ready),\" Higbee said.\n\nThank you to the Area 51 Raiders! Whilst I wouldn't personally recommend taking on the State at what it does best, getting as close as practically possible tends to bring these otherwise relatively hidden realities further out into the open - a potentially more interesting and important 'secret' than any actual 'alien technology' or whatever is still left in this military enclave (surely, if they are actually allowed to get through somehow, anything actually secret/important will be long gone(?)).\n\nWhatever actually happens in Area 51 the fact that people are beginning to 'take matters into their own hands' is broadly a positive sign that they're seeing through the legal/propaganda/Constitutional/media/social/political etc. facades that hold us all back from ever daring to confront the State and it's minions. I suggest the State is weakest financially and in the realm of ideas (where it tends to pluck 'authority' from thin air), but everyone wrestles with the same 'Beast' in their own way\n\n![multi_headed_hydra.jpeg (268x188)](data/img/post_73_multi_headed_hydra.jpeg)\n\n... good luck ...\n\n<small>![Monero_-_XMR.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_Monero_-_XMR.png)</small> `45fhpAMoRv4BPhnuLrSQkWYNuEykatoDUdn59SmzdJ2GQ8RUtEf6qir8Ai3JE7gJGz9RAPLJwDPUME7eCbVMMv9SKrBPhLj`<small></small>\n\n![BC_Logo_.png (64x64)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1NKRzUcFsMC6ihXDMtKi5EVwKopShVtYHE/data/img/post_48_BC_Logo_.png)\n\n`1QAJsWSospHreu479y5TAAJFhjnEhqwoV8`"

Perhaps Agorism, and many other ism's, are appealing when we consider the big picture but one might legitimately ask 'what happens when you get right down to the human level?'. Surely, if there were no State, there would be _nothing_ to prevent this kind of tragedy from occurring far more frequently? The owner of these dogs could laugh in the face of the father and walk away from the entire incident, changing nothing until another hapless child suffers a similar fate. Is that what _you_ would do? If you knew you could 'get away with it'. Unless this chap is a psychopath (about 1% of the World's population) it is probable he is feeling quite a bit of remorse, just as you or I would. Our common humanity is not a reason to gather round the State, as we are so often told, it's the key to being able to live together in a better, but never perfect, World.\n\nSo what's the solution? 'Something must be done!' is the clarion call of the Statist. By whom, how, when, where, what etc.? You probably have some opinions, but imagine if your opinions actually mattered. Currently your opinion doesn't really matter no what you're told. You can say almost anything you like but at the end of the day the 'solution' will be to vote for a politician and let them tell you the answers as they do here\n\n'The dogs will likely be euthanised, city officials said.'\n\nOr the employees of the State\n\n\"Certainly the owner has a responsibility when they have violent animals that those animals are to be secured at all times. If you can't secure the animal, you shouldn't have the animal. Period.\" (Detroit police Chief)\n\nYou may or may not agree.

Perhaps it would have a little more leverage than you could muster in an argument with your neighbor. It would have to compete and mediate with other similar security services subscribed to by all your fellow humans (which, unfortunately or not, might include the psychopaths and/or your neighbor) and that may not deliver the _ideal_ solution in your opinion, but you can achieve a better approximation than a 'solution' that is effectively forced upon you as it comes as a single, indivisible entity in the form of the politician and his State.\n\n![xi_and_communist_party.jpeg (301x168)](data/img/post_72_xi_and_communist_party.jpeg)​​​​​​​\n\nIf this sounds outrageous to you please ask yourself why you are so outraged at being able to make _your own_ choices about how we secure ourselves and family in this world. Or is it the thought of _others_ being able to do the same that is worrisome? Common humanity collectively making these choices through a genuinely free market minimizes the impact of the psychopaths relative to the current Statist approach that rewards, promotes and hands power over to them\n\n![reno_and_clinton.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_72_reno_and_clinton.jpeg)\n\n(Reno and Clinton)\n\nSaying that we don't like/disagree with the politicians after the fact equates to not actually addressing the issues at all.

All the problems originate in violent aggression by groups, large or small, that believe they somehow have acquired the right to attack other people and undermine or completely destroy their lives. When attacked and the response is simply legitimate defense this can be understood in an isolated incident. When it drags on for decades in an endless tit-for-tat or all out war the tangled knot gets dumped on generation after generation, each brought up on their own tribe's version of events.

Whilst such a development, Palestinian Muslim women in Congress, may start a long process towards redressing information and understanding gaps and ultimately an improvement in the particularities of the Arab/Israeli conflict, it won't address the basis upon which Congress, it's representatives and the 'House' in general functions.

It's been tried before\n\n![clinton_Rabin_Arafat.jpg (439x300)](data/img/post_71_clinton_Rabin_Arafat.jpg)\n\nThe problem is that these 'leaders' sit atop giant nations of people who believe that the violent imposition of their ideas onto others is a good and righteous way to operate.\n\n![tax_cheating_mag.jpeg (196x258)](data/img/post_71_tax_cheating_mag.jpeg)\n\nIf the 'leaders' didn't believe that and the people didn't believe it, then there wouldn't be a 'nation' to fight for (which would be, I suggest, a good thing). With their beliefs in mind it is hardly surprising that the politician's PR exercises eventually collapse as people beneath them do what appears to come naturally. It's true that it may be a relatively small group of 'extremists' that actually give expression to the idea, but that's all it takes. Their position will remain logically consistent with the activities of the State however it's configured after some 'settlement'. That's a debate almost no-one wants to have (including I suspect these new congresswomen) .\n\nIt's unlikely that anyone, including myself of course, will properly appreciate all the nuances of this conflict without having been deeply embedded in that part of the World. When you know you don't know you only have principle left to guide. My principle tells me I wouldn't take up arms on behalf of anyone in this mess and I wouldn't send financial and logistical support either ... but wait a moment, how many billions of tax dollars did this article state is being sent to Israel each year?

You can argue that the individual is not the nation, however, this doesn't sit well with the constant _Statist_ clarion call of 'acting together', 'acting as one' and all the other expressions of 'national unity' they are so fond of espousing. An important hallmark of Statism is meddling. They don't know how to leave anyone or anything alone. Taxation, regulation and a constant propaganda bombardment are just some of the more obvious manifestations of their incessant meddling in the lives of ordinary people. When they consider themselves as 'one nation' within the 'international community' however, the narrative suddenly changes. [Everything that the individual is supposed to simply waive away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain) becomes a [matter of great 'national pride' and the 'sovereignty of the nation' is jealously guarded.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/china-will-guard-its-sovereignty-not-concede-an-inch-of-land-xi/articleshow/63375606.cms)\n\nSo, for as long as it exists, you will find the arch hypocrite, the arch meddler, complaining about other 'meddlers', while it gets on with the [business of 'meddling'](https://foreignpolicy.com/2008/08/18/the-list-the-10-worst-chinese-laws/) in the lives of it's 'own people'.\n\n![govt_meddling.jpeg (269x188)](data/img/post_70_govt_meddling.jpeg)\n\nOne of the popular refrains whenever one dares to question the State, is 'if you don't like it why don't you leave and go to ... (X country)?' The irony is that the more Statist the world becomes the more absurd, yet powerful, this statement is. In a world of genuine individuality and free markets it's quite true that if X doesn't like Y, and Y's preferred environment, they can avoid them with little consequence. Simply move on to a more conducive environment, or find a way to work out the differences, often via a value exchange of some kind. In a world of nation States, with vast areas of land under control of different States, it is far harder to simply change one's environment and move to a more conducive one; more likely simply jumping from the 'frying pan into the fire'. Taken to it's absurd logical conclusion, with a global super-State, such a refrain would mean moving to the Moon or similar.\n\nThe Statist making this refrain is avoiding the real issue, which is the right to 'meddle' backed by violent aggression that lies at the heart of voting, which is a major justification that's used for the existence of the State. Y may want to meddle in X's life by, for example, voting for a law that restricts free speech. X may want to meddle in Y's life by, for example, voting for a law that X considers protects the environment. Both want their positions to, ultimately, be backed by physical violence. Otherwise they're simply having a debate; which is fine, but there's a big difference between a debate and aggressive violence. Voting and Democracy appear to involve the former, but actually revert to the latter by default and stay that way unless explicitly repealed. Anyone who doesn't conform to the Law will be fined and/or beaten and/or caged. If something matters to you, e.g the environment, back that up with your economic value (i.e. pay for whatever measures _you_ believe will improve the environment). In other words use your economic, not your political, power. Your political power is virtually non-existent as it manifests today, no matter how much you are told otherwise, and is highly susceptible to manipulation. We tend to be far more discerning and honest with our economic power; if not _we_ more clearly and fairly bear the costs of _our_ mistakes, delusions and in-competencies from which _we_ are able, or not, to learn from as _we_ grow up. This may appear to be an unnerving prospect. No 'Big Brother' to save us from ourselves. Pick up the pieces when we make a foolish error. Look after us when we don't make enough medical provision etc. But 'Big Brother' doesn't come for free either. Every part of his existence is paid for by you in terms of economic, political, social and virtually every other existential dimension you care to think of. You're going to pay, one way or the other. The difference is which 'way' do you individually have more control over?\n\n![abortion_law.jpeg (267x189)](data/img/post_70_abortion_law.jpeg)\n\nSo next time you hear them talking about 'meddling' via their talking heads, ask yourself what's really being said. Do they really believe that 'meddling' is a bad thing in _principle_? See how far they're prepared to carry that principle in practice. It won't be long before you start hearing excuses and logical fallacies relating to 'pragmatism' and similar intellectual escape hatches.\n\n![escape_hatch.jpeg (259x194)](data/img/post_70_escape_hatch.jpeg)\n\nFor once the Chinese State is right. It's not ok to meddle. But do they really look for the wisdom within themselves or are they just looking out and lecturing the rest of the world like all the others?\n\n![xi_and_the_queen.jpeg (269x188)](data/img/post_70_xi_and_the_queen.jpeg)"

Completely unable to perceive the underlying problem of the State - it's ultimate reliance on violent aggression. Of course the United States is a giant, bloated, bullying, out of control monstrosity; but then so is every other State on the planet. They're just not as good at it ... yet. Observe the contempt that any State holds for weaker opposition in their own given 'spheres of influence'. If any individual were to deny the 'Right' of the State to plunder their resources at gunpoint (taxation), the true relationship will immediately become apparent. They all believe in violent aggression and the imposition of what they 'know best' for the 'greater good'.\n\nIt looks good, it sounds good\n\n![Ocasio-Cortez.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_69_Ocasio-Cortez.jpeg)\n\n([Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez))\n\nbut, someone has to pay for it\n\n![yellow_vest_and_police.jpeg (301x167)](data/img/post_69_yellow_vest_and_police.jpeg)\n\n(France)\n\n![crisis_in_venezuala.jpeg (308x164)](data/img/post_69_crisis_in_venezuala.jpeg)\n\n(Venezuela)\n\nYou don't solve a problem by using the same thinking that got you there in the first place. What is the solution that all these politicians (gangsters with a strong track record) propose to containing one of their own, who just happens to have been better at it than them, and for some time now? Gang up on the U.S. and violently force it to join a new, bigger, better, improved, international association of organized violence and internal suppression, of course. Give the 'solution' a nice fuzzy, warm sounding name like '**multilateralism**' and you have a new banner to 'unite' under in which forcing your self-righteous 'solutions' down the throats of ordinary people can be done on a scale hitherto un-imagined and with a breath taking ferocity that only deeply indoctrinated Statists are able to stomach\n\n![Nanjing_massacre.jpeg (220x195)](data/img/post_69_Nanjing_massacre.jpeg)\n\n(Nanjing Massacre one of a large number of possible examples)\n\nPerhaps we will have (yet) another sample in Hong Kong over the coming weeks?\n\nThe clever part about a problem-reaction-solution dialectic is that you get well intentioned do gooders to do all the heavy lifting for you. Which brings us to the title article. When representatives from regimes like Russia and Iran are making pronouncements on behalf of the 'people' you know there's something up. Just imagine how much _your_ opinion will count in the world that _you_ live in when all these Statists have managed to rid themselves of the last vestiges of individual freedoms supposedly enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\n![un_general_assembly.jpeg (349x144)](data/img/post_69_un_general_assembly.jpeg)\n\nGet ready, for example, to have every aspect of your life tightly controlled for the 'sin' of being human, or, more topically, possessing a 'carbon footprint'\n\n![carbon_footprint.png (1064x599)](data/img/post_69_carbon_footprint.png)\n\nSame old wolves, new sheep's clothing\n\n![pope_denounces_climate_deniers.jpeg (307x164)](data/img/post_69_pope_denounces_climate_deniers.jpeg)\n\n[Pope denounces climate change deniers](https://www.dw.com/en/pope-francis-denounces-climate-change-deniers/a-40452499)\n\nIndependent, free thinking individuals, 'bad'. Giant, self-righteous, 'moral' bureaucracies 'good'.\n\nMr. Zeese is right about one thing 'We need to prepare for a new era as the 2020’s offer potential for significant social and political transformation'. But might I suggest that we let the people who actually live in the real world determine what shape that transformation takes through unfettered free trade, no artificial borders, free from the delusions and distortions of voting (when that means violent coercion) and, of course, taxation which feeds the whole facade. I suggest it now, before [everyone becomes labelled a 'terrorist'](https://theglobepost.com/2018/11/04/pittsburgh-terrorism-trumpism/) and we all fall victim to the globalist monstrosity we helped to build."

Picking and choosing to suit the political proclivities of the moment. The only principle at stake is pragmatism, which is no principle at all.\n\nI don't suppose many thinking people will be taken in for a moment by Trump's 'humane' gesture. But how about when things get a little more 'Tienanmen Square'? Won't Trump, the 'American Way', 'our system', 'democracy' etc. all start to look rather 'good' by comparison? Who wouldn't look good sitting next to Ted Bundy over time?\n\nThat's a pretty low bar, by anyone's standards and the repeating implications and hypocrisy of such headlines, that we get bombarded by on a daily basis, should, I suggest, be understood for what they are ... symptoms of a dangerous game that no-one should be playing, supposedly on our behalf, in the name of 'humanity'."

This is not new. History is fundamentally a story of the tension between State and social power.\n\n![police_at_hk_airport.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_67_police_at_hk_airport.jpeg)\n\nI have written before about how I support the spirit of these (and the yellow vests in France) protesters, but not the tactics. How many of these protesters have voted, recently, or in the past? At the moment of voting you have not 'made your voice heard at the ballot box', as we are led to believe. At that moment you have just given away all your power. You have endorsed the extortion. You have given in to terrorism. Now you just look stupid.\n\nOne of the age old devices of the State is to offer an exchange of freedom for security. For large sections of the more vulnerable in society (not exuberant youth) this is a tempting offer, which has been accepted more times in the past than I care to list here. To appeal to these sections of society the State needs to present itself as the 'reasonable, moderate and safe' 'pair of hands' that it is not.\n\n![carrie_lam.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_67_carrie_lam.jpeg)\n\nPuppet of the moment, Carrie Lam, trots out the usual lines: 'she said it would be her responsibility to rebuild Hong Kong's economy' as if it has been totally destroyed by people's desperate attempts to backtrack on their support for the system in the first place. 'and address the people's concerns after the unrest'. Isn't that what 'democracy' (I know it's a deeply compromised Statist parody of 'democracy') does already? That was the route into this, not the way out. That is the 'Abyss'.\n\n'Mrs Lam's superiors in Beijing have demanded an end to the protests before addressing any underlying grievances.' How exactly would the protests end if nothing has changed? These 'superiors' know this, of course. They are salivating at the prospect of a 'deepening crisis' that they will not, ultimately, allow to go to waste. What are the the 'underlying grievances'? The extension of State (in the terrifying form of China) power. They have every intention of 'addressing' the grievances, in the same ways they always have:\n\n![tiannamen_30_yrs_on.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_67_tiannamen_30_yrs_on.jpeg)\n\n(Tienanmen 30 years on)\n\nThe Statist double speak is clear: 'Chief Executive Carrie Lam yesterday repeated her defence of the police's use of tear gas against protesters, saying she would not question law enforcement tactics.' Further on: She added: \"I am sad about anyone injured during protests and violent acts. I hope that they will get well soon.\" This is how 'responsible' she really is. She is the lying hypocrite that any politician, and by extension voter, has to be the moment they kiss the Statist ring.\n\nThe journalists, self-righteously sitting on the sidelines taking pot shots, manage still to remain on both sides of the equation:\n\nFrom the tedious and banal:\n\n\"You blame your own political misjudgment on others and refuse to acknowledge your mistakes,\" said a reporter from Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK.\n\n'Political misjudgment and mistakes' from whose perspective?' What astute decisions would this intrepid journalist have made in the same position?\n\nTo the idiotic:\n\n\"Mrs Lam, many citizens have been asking recently when you will die,\" yelled another.\n\nWith 'freedom fighters' like this, their political masters in Beijing will be purring.

If you are not free to speculate, you are not free. The freedom to speculate is an important battleground in the struggle between the individual and the State. It's a key to narrative control:\n\n![blair_and_bush.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_66_blair_and_bush.jpeg)\n\nThe State's 'Right' to monopolize it should always be challenged and negated, just as apologists for the State will generally object to any individual that dares to challenge the State's prevailing narratives, even if that individual is the State's own puppet:\n\n![cnn_trump_conspiracies.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_66_cnn_trump_conspiracies.jpeg)\n\nSpeculation carries more or less weight depending on the full context. The full context may well initially require speculation to be properly appreciated. In other words, like friction in engineering, you may try to minimize it's effects but it is still necessary to a certain degree. It is defined as:\n\n'the forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence' (Oxford Dictionary (online))\n\nThis is one reason why the State ensures that it has evidence gathering capabilities far beyond anything the individual could ever hope for\n\n![nsa_data_center.jpeg (274x184)](data/img/post_66_nsa_data_center.jpeg)\n\n(NSA)\n\nThe imbalance in access to 'firm evidence', in a similar way to the imbalance in access to physical violence, is an important component to the broad imbalance of power that exists and the individual [is not protected by pieces of paper such as the Constitution](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/which-types-of-speech-are-not-protected-by-the-first-amendment/)[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts)\n\nWhat's this got to do with Epstein? You will see/hear this dynamic played out in any discussion you may encounter on the topic. It's an important and interesting issue on many levels but, I suggest, in the discussion the sanctity of your 'Right' (whatever that may actually mean) to speculate without 'firm evidence' will crop up at some point. Speculating doesn't make you 'right', of course, but doing so isn't 'wrong' either. If anyone tells you that you shouldn't speculate think about what it is they are actually trying to take away from you - your ability to express your ideas in the light of the evidence that you _do_ have (for e.g. we have fairly firm evidence that he is, at least, _supposed_ to have died and was connected at high levels). If you don't have that ability, then what are you (because it's one of the few things that separate us from the rest of natural creation)? Whatever your position on the topic, [could any animal you know of have speculated on it like this?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness)\n\nIf there are dubious mechanisms managing the dark underbelly of the State, what would you replace them with? More laws, regulations, 'morality', outrage, demands etc.? None of these things have ever made any real difference over time because people know best for themselves what is best for themselves. Simply creating new sets of morality based narratives around the 'discovery' of such activities will, more often than not, play into the hands of the State.\n\n![ECHR_judges_insulting_not_free_speech.jpeg (308x164)](data/img/post_66_ECHR_judges_insulting_not_free_speech.jpeg)\n\n[Insulting prophet not free expression say judges at ECHR](https://www.dailysabah.com/europe/2018/10/25/insulting-prophet-muhammad-not-free-speech-ecthr-rules)\n\nLet the free expression of the free market decide such matters, not the State's employees."

If by 'capitalist' it is meant 'free marketeer' then I am in alignment. If one's definition of 'capitalist' covers vast swathes of real world industry and capital investment in artificial constructs such as 'public-private partnerships' then I am not. A Chinese state run 'firm' is very far from 'free market' by almost anyone's standard so I won't debate that here. If by 'firm' it is meant ongoing extortion racket then the title headline starts to make more sense.\n\nWorking for the 'big boss' and living off his stolen loot comes with certain conditions, the first of which is a limitation on freedom.

It will garner all the forces at it's disposal to attempt to ensure the spirit of resistance is snuffed out. Galvanizing it's own army of slaves to be part of that effort is entirely logical. Whether it is successful is up to them although it may not appear that way when they believe they depend on the State for their subsistence.

There is no reason for this to change as the numbers multiply, right up to the billions in a State like India. When you watch the news on this topic there will be a lot of discussion about Article 370, two wars, 70 years of an arrangement set up after independence from Britain etc. from all the talking heads. The closer you get to the center of mainstream politics the more talk of 'it's complicated' and 'requires restraint' etc. there will be. Less talk about what is actually happening, which is that a large army of heavily armed men, taking orders from a political ideologue has just re-imposed it's views about 'order' on another set of people. Let's go, once again, to our (Google supplied) definition of 'terrorist':\n\n'a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.'\n\nOf course, 'lawful/unlawful' means whatever the politician/terrorist wants it mean. 'Due process' means whatever the politician/terrorist wants it to mean. What it actually means, as the people of Kashmir know only too well, is that you will find yourself starring down the barrel of a gun unless and until you are 'reasonable' and 'show restraint'.\n\nThe State is built on terror. It should not surprise us when a State, any State, seeks ways to extend it's power and control over ordinary people. The logic doesn't change and you will find it at the heart of every large scale conflict where ever you go.\n\nThe aggressor politician has the perverse job of presenting his own acts of terror as somehow righteous. So in the age old way that politicians and 'leaders' always have this one is 'justifying' the violent aggression by slapping illogical labels onto phenomenon and then denouncing, and threatening of course, anyone who objects as a 'troublemaker' (or potentially even a 'terrorist'), on the basis that his side represents the [circular reasoning](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/66/Circular-Reasoning) of 'lawful' authority. What this means is 'I have the guns'. I'm a bigger terrorist than you so I get to do the labeling.\n\nNot much good is likely to come out of this Kashmir move. Not least that all the other Statists will be considering how best to 'not let a good crisis go to waste' and manipulate it for their own agendas. The only positive I can think of is that it may help, through it's audacity, to reveal what 'responsible' politicians are really all about and how self serving language can be. Unfortunately, as well, how often people will allow themselves to be seduced by these labels into convincing themselves that such activities are, at least on some level, legitimate."

They fulfill the role of 'protector' by avenging the boy, they get to cage another 'citizen', they can leave the part about 'respecting the national anthem' quietly implied (an unspoken 'truth') and they (State employees), most importantly, get to make themselves appear like the sober, reasonable and just arbiters of what is 'good' and 'evil' when they send him down for what will probably be a lengthy term. In fact this character's biggest mistake was being too obvious (violent coercion is axiomatic to the State). They'll be happy to sacrifice him as a propaganda tool. Very few will reflect, at any length, over the root cause of such violent outbursts.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the boy has been made stronger or weaker from the experience. We'll know it's the later, perhaps, if we get to read a similar story in a couple of decades time.\n\n![teen_boy.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_63_teen_boy.jpeg)\n\nMore telling, on a daily basis, that you can experience for yourself, is the subtle and sometimes not so subtle endorsement of the same values and ideals of 'respect' for the 'Nation State' in your conversations with those around you. If you find yourself agreeing with many of those ideas perhaps you could ask yourself where they originally came from and did you always _voluntarily_ subscribe to them. Do you even today?"

Disliking and _hence_ caging anyone who disagrees or disliking and attempting to persuade others to agree with your perspective? Unless you personally have control over a policing and imprisonment system, when _you or I_ condemn everyone can safely ignore what's said. When a Statist in power condemns it could mean mass arrests and caging or not, depending on the political climate. There is a substantial difference between the two 'condemns'. Why, then, fall into the trap of adopting the language of Statist double speak?\n\nDespite all the endless appeals to 'equality', everyone thinks they're superior in one way or another. Intellectually, morally, practically, physically, ethically ... etc. the list is endless. Not all at once, but along certain dimensions. In proportion it's normal, I would argue that it's healthy. Like many other normal and natural aspects of the human condition, we are coerced into feeling guilt, when _we_ manifest such 'superiority' in a way that could lead to a lessening of control over us. When it's out of proportion it's unhealthy. Which is not a problem until you add the power that Statism bestows upon the deluded maniac with extreme views about 'superiority' (starting with his own and somehow trickling down by association to the rest of the 'Nation'):\n\n![hitler_in_car.jpeg (325x155)](data/img/post_62_hitler_in_car.jpeg)\n\n![netanyahu.jpeg (299x168)](data/img/post_62_netanyahu.jpeg)\n\n![trump_smug.jpeg (277x182)](data/img/post_62_trump_smug.jpeg)\n\netc. (insert almost any Statist you care to think of).\n\nWhat is a 'supremacist'?

It is the ideology that ultimately pulls the trigger. That is the issue. But it's only a problem when people believe that _their_ ideology is superior to everyone else's and they have the _power_ to impose their ideology on others. This is why the State wants/needs to disarm people wherever they are. The Statist knows, deep down, that the basis for his existence as Statist is the imposition of his 'superior' views via the initiation of aggressive physical violence, because there is no ideology that otherwise justifies it.\n\nAs a good puppet Trump knows he needs to go after the ideology of freedom first before the reality of physical power in the hands of ordinary people can be neutralized. Whether he takes the politically sensitive step of enacting his views into the mass disarming and caging process remains to be seen ... whether he, and his fellow Statists across the entire political spectrum, will ever stop trying cannot be in doubt."

Medication can exist in a free market, insurance can exist in a free market, charity can exist in a free market. All these things are possible without being overseen by an extortion racket.

No. Does removing officially sanctioned extortion and self serving [State and oiligarch narratives](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/17/nhs-health) help us to have and make better choices?

This kind of media coverage helps to ensure that it occurs to few that rattling around inside this false dichotomy is simply another one of many distractions which enable the continued existence of the State's iron grasp over people's lives, as any other approach is quickly dismissed as [anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy) (misconstrued as chaos) ... and everyone _knows_ that can't be right ..."

Well, market forces (distorted by a huge stash of stolen loot). The harder something is to get hold of (demand side), the more you have to pay to get it (supply side). It's encouraging that people are playing hard(er) to get. The State's recruiters complain when an apparently (actually short lived) improving economy makes it harder for them to do their job. This is telling when it comes to understanding why a State has ambiguous approaches to a burgeoning economy (increasing taxes, tariffs, regulation etc.).

Only one thing stands in the way of my complete endorsement: logic.\n\nReduced to it's essentials, by labeling more accurately, it violates one of the most fundamental principles of logic - that you cannot assert something and it's opposite simultaneously. An assertion cannot be true and untrue at the same time; not for most people, most the time (tell your partner you're 'having an affair, but not having an affair' and see if that works for them).\n\nI won't elaborate on the historical antagonisms between the State and free speech, with which we're all familiar.\n\n![burnt_at_the_stake.jpeg (875x679)](data/img/post_55_burnt_at_the_stake.jpeg)\n\nand continue to this day in it's multifarious modern forms:\n\n![police_and_free_speech.jpeg (267x189)](data/img/post_55_police_and_free_speech.jpeg)\n\nThe original article does a good job of reminding us of just how long the fundamental principles of the U.S. Constitution were actually subscribed to (22 years, at best, given the Alien and Sedition Act was enacted in 1798).\n\n'Free speech' is a marketing slogan for the State. When it's new and young it needs it's 'citizens' support to feed it into existence. Once they are more dependent on the State than it is on them 'free speech' can be eroded back out of existence as 'free speech', which underpins 'freedom' of any kind, is anathema to a State.\n\nAll this is obvious. Where's the contradiction?\n\nWhat is meant by 'American'? The assumption is that 'American' is somehow different to the Statist axiom of 'anti-free speech'. But 'America' is, and always has been, a State itself. All the people who supported the American Revolutionary War, the Declaration of Independence, voted for Representatives etc. believed in 'America' and 'America' functioned, at it's core, through violence to ensure it's survival as 'America'. Anyone who understood this and attempted to resist it was quickly put down. [Not just by the 'elites' that setup their new State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion), [but by their fellow 'citizens'.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion#Aftermath)\n\nIn other words people had fled the oppression of their European homelands to a new life of 'freedom' but not been able to rid themselves of the Statist within. That part of their thinking that told them that violently forcing your opinions on others through vehicles like taxation is 'responsible' and 'good'. They hadn't realized where the 'oppression' they had escaped in Europe really came from (their own ideas and beliefs). The subsequent history of America has unfolded logically from there, as the article nicely summarizes.\n\nNot understanding this principle is why we are lurching headlong into a Huxlean/Orwellian dystopia whilst all the time declaring our undying support for 'free speech'. No-one who debates anything can logically claim to be opposed to free speech since the moment even the idea of being opposed to free speech is communicated the principle has been exercised. The anti-free speech advocate, however it's presented, is an _instant_ hypocrite.\n\n![free_speech_hypocrisy.jpg (540x287)](data/img/post_55_free_speech_hypocrisy.jpg)\n\n![free_speech_hypocrisy2.jpg (300x168)](data/img/post_55_free_speech_hypocrisy2.jpg)\n\nIdeas, opinions, values, beliefs etc. are one thing. Physically _initiating_ violence against others is something else. _Defending_ against the physical violence of others is something else again. Which applies is down to _your_ judgement. It only matters if you have the _ability_ to defend yourself. You don't need a piece of paper used as a marketing strategy by a bunch of 'Elites' to work that out. You do need a great deal of patience and tolerance to do it wisely in _your_ life ....... or you can leave it up to this guy (and all the others like him) ...\n\n![aggressive_trump.jpeg (300x168)](data/img/post_55_aggressive_trump.jpeg)"

The problem is that 'person' is a [psychopath gas-lighter](https://newrepublic.com/article/145953/stalin-starved-ukraine). The solution is to see it for what it is and withdraw from it. Once a victim of such manipulation this is easier said than done, even on an individual level. At the level of broader society it is a monumental challenge.\n\nIt is that challenge the people of Hong Kong face. I salute them. Although I suggest it would help for them to have a clear understanding of what they are up against. They are not up against China (it's just another geographical region). They are not up against 'oppression' (that could mean almost anything). They are not up against the 'Law' (insofar as 'Law' is merely an expression of shared norms - a reflection, not a source, of conflict). They are up against a State (which is just a (deluded) state of mind). No other State will support the protesters ([no matter what rhetoric is used to advance inter State rivalries](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/uk-support-for-hong-kong-freedoms-is-unwavering-fm-hunt-11680428)), for the obvious reason that if they actually did, in an effective way, it would undermine the basis for their own 'existence'. This is easy to appreciate if you consider the Spanish Civil War which virtually all major powers at the time conveniently ignored, despite justifying their own bloodbath (WWII) as a fight for 'freedom and democracy'.\n\nThe way the Chinese State will proceed is the same way that all States proceed in these circumstances. It will use the 'protesters' misunderstanding of the true nature of their relationship to the State against them. It will appear to 'order', 'calm' and to it's own 'authority' as the basis for claiming that the protester's behavior is ill-founded and that only an entity as 'responsible' and 'powerful' as the State can elicit a positive resolution. Once it is accepted that the State does indeed fulfill such a role, anyone running around in the streets exercising the only option left available for expressing themselves, will be framed as a disruptive and destructive 'troublemaker', whose behavior and particularly ideas need to be 're-orientated'. This will seem 'natural' for anyone (most people) brought up and educated in societies that have never known life without such a State pervading and controlling all aspects of their lives. Without the State being the final arbiter of what is 'right' and 'wrong'.\n\n[No State will tolerate real opposition to the ideas upon which it is founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States).

Applied as a principle. Of course, if you murdered someone you might not 'consent' to be jailed/executed for it afterwards.

Why do I mention this in relation to an article about Ilhan Omar?\n\n![Ilan_Omar.jpeg (108x135)](data/img/post_50_Ilan_Omar.jpeg)\n\nIt is because she is a politician in the normal sense of that word. This means, by implication, she does not adhere to the principle above. Every politician seeks to be a 'leader' with the 'authority' to force others to do things to which they don't consent (if you don't believe me please name one who doesn't). The concerns regarding whether or not a particular individual reflects your personal outlook on the World are fundamentally predicated on the assumption above. Without the ability to violently coerce why should I have the slightest concern, what Ilhan Omar, Donald Trump, Clintons, Hitler, Mickey Mouse or any of the others think, how they live their lives or what their background is? If I agree to contract with someone for some mutually beneficial arrangement such as a trade I might start to become interested. Otherwise, unless they are organizing a threat against me personally I will not worry. Why am I writing about her then? All these politicians are part of an organized threat against myself and everyone/anyone else whose values don't exactly coincide with their own. They are, therefore, dangerous and it is unfortunately necessary to have some awareness of what they're up to, although the vast majority of the time the best 'solution', as with any potential threat, is simply to walk away and ignore.

This means outside of state sanctioned violence. When 'law' itself is founded upon violence and intimidation the term becomes superfluous. Under Statism if you choose not to vote (the false dichotomy) and/or not pay tax (tribune) it is not your law, it's their's. They will then visit their 'unlawful' violence upon you. Terrorists according to **their** definition. Knowing this is not the issue, accepting it's implications is.\n\nSo what does it mean if a State bans a 'terrorist' group? It means it has become some kind of threat to their monopoly on violence in their particular sphere of influence or, far more likely most the time, that flicking the switch from 'lawful' to 'unlawful' can assist in the complex chess game of outmaneuvering your Statist rivals.\n\nThe journalist writing this article believes 'The designation is not only timely, but it also provides the global support and legitimacy required for any crackdown\"\n\nIn this context 'terrorist' IRGC Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, \"If Pakistan fails to punish [Jaish al-Adl] in the near future, Iran will do so based on international law and will retaliate against the terrorists.”\n\nInternational law is notoriously inconsistent and ultimately as flawed as individual State laws for the same reasons:\n\n\"A system of legal norms should be free of contradictions. The idea of justice is incompatible with an erratic interpretation and, subsequently, arbitrary application of norms. Systemic contradictions make actions by state authorities unpredictable. However, at the domestic as well as at the international level, considerations of power and interest have often made of the respective body of norms a “hermeneutical minefield.” The international legal order contains contradictions even between the most basic principles such as state sovereignty, self-determination and the rules of international humanitarian law. While, at the national level, the authority of constitutional courts may help to eliminate contradictions and inconsistencies, there exists, apart from limited regional arrangements, no such separation of powers at the international level. The article analyzes the systemic, destabilizing impact of normative contradictions in exemplary cases related to the interpretation of the UN Charter and the system of international humanitarian and international criminal law.\"\n\n[Source](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190848194.001.0001/oso-9780190848194-chapter-9)\n\nThe U.S. has been [desperately looking for ways to ratchet up confrontation with Iran](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/bolton-keeps-trying-goad-iran-war/592108/). So rather than 'a confidence-building measure that could lead to negotiations and a new nuclear deal' there is the at least equal possibility that this 'positive signal from the United States to Iran' could be part of that game. 'Unlawful' Iran has been setup to potentially overreact to an attack emanating from 'lawful' Pakistan. Iran might consider these 'Greeks bearing gifts' rather cautiously, unlike Saddam Hussein who [made a similar mistake in relation to his attack on Kuwai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Glaspie)t.\n\nHow quickly and easily such things could escalate and create the conflict that Statism feeds off. Will it happen this time, in this way? Who am I to say? One thing I can be relatively confident about - the State will almost always interpret 'lawful' in it's own favor, whether in [domestic](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/16/london-bridge-attack-police-lawfully-killed-terrorists-inquest-finds), or international affairs.

When you live in poverty every new dollar you receive makes a relatively big difference to your circumstances. Once wealthy, as the saying goes, 'how many yachts can you water-ski behind?'. The transitions and adaptions to these new circumstances are one of the things that make life interesting and challenging. China has clearly undergone a transition. At the same time it's wholehearted adoption of the Statist philosophy has always been patent.\n\n![chinese_statism.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_48_chinese_statism.jpeg)\n\nBut, [with the help of Western financiers](https://www.corbettreport.com/deal-with-the-devil-how-the-global-elite-re-colonized-china/), it has added material wealth in the familiar Statist two-step of managing the benefits of freedom for the purposes of theft, in the form of taxation, with political dominance, to ensure those benefits only serve to expand State power and control. Then it's just a question of narrative management to ensure the State comes out looking like the champion for 'freedom' ('we made you wealthy didn't we?') or 'the oppressed' ('where would you be without us?') according to the particular political requirements of the moment.\n\nXi Jinping epitomizes this Chinese State as you might expect. If his image ceases to fulfill the role of representing the sacrifice of personal responsibility and development to the 'greater good' of the State, he will be replaced by another symptom, who perhaps reflects it in a slightly less unflattering (to the individual) light. However distinct most commentators would have you believe they are, Statists are still Statists at heart:\n\n![trump_and_xi_are_the_same.jpeg (290x174)](data/img/post_48_trump_and_xi_are_the_same.jpeg)\n\nUntil ordinary people confront the Statist within themselves it makes little difference what puppet happens to be the repository for all their hopes and dreams (and delusions).

When changes take place in society and there is a degree of uncertainty and confusion it's harder for many to override the programming and place the new changes into their proper context. A context in which the State, which controls how we are all 'educated', isn't perceived as the solution to all our problems.\n\nSo it is with technology. New technology represents an enormous paradigm shift for society. It presents new opportunities and challenges and disrupts old ways of thinking and doing things. Figuring out what's 'right' and 'wrong' in these circumstances might appear overwhelming. But actually it's not at all. Technology is just a tool. A powerful one, but merely a tool none the less. It doesn't change the fundamental relation between Man and State. That is, the historic struggle for Man to rid himself of the State. Once it is understood that a violent extortion racket is a poor basis (in principle and practice) for the advancement of Man's condition, putting technology's relation to it in context becomes a great deal more straightforward.\n\nThe State is often said to be 'behind', 'slow to adapt' etc. to rapidly changing technological circumstances, but here we see it nimbly taking advantage of the lack of awareness of how State power extends itself and confusion regarding 'privacy' to not only take a huge dip into the profits of this company (which ultimately translates to higher consumer prices) but deliver a lecture on what it deems 'appropriate' behavior at the same time. Facebook is not a State. No representative from Facebook has ever appeared at my doorstep threatening to rob and cage me because I don't subscribe to their services. Facebook has never sent me threatening correspondence coercing me into conforming to it's corporate code of conduct. I am free to ignore Facebook and I do.\n\nIf you are concerned about the activities of any organization you freely trade with (tech or otherwise) you are free to stop your patronage according to the contract you have freely made with them. You are in control. You call the shots.\n\nWhat this implies is taking responsibility for one's own life and choices. What that means to you is up to you and I'm not about to succumb to my conditioning and start delivering a self-righteous sermon of my own. I'm going to assume you know best for yourself, what's best for yourself - something the State will **never** allow unless they've already painted you into a false dichotomy of their own making (e.g. voting).\n\nThe technology is new, but the age old frighten, coerce and plunder routine has the flexibility to adapt to it very successfully. Similarly technology alone won't save us from falling for the same old tricks if we don't start to question our own assumptions about what the State is (a delusion) and what it's role should be (non-existent)."

They live in fear of, and are deluded by, the State. It's true that the Western States are deliberately provoking and undermining the lives of people in Iran. That is what States do. They feed off conflict. They need an 'enemy'. They did it in the process of establishing themselves as the State in first place and it is only logical for them to continue doing it once 'in power'. \"Who's not suffering?\" asks one man rhetorically, referring to US sanctions. But what are 'US sanctions'? They're restrictions of free trade by a Statist power. People in Iran are just as accustomed to the State interfering in their trading relationships as the people in the US. Conflict enables the State to distract it's local population from the realities of their own oppression and focus on some external 'threat'. This is so well known that it is merely a platitude. However, people fall for it every time because it creates an 'acceptable narrative' within their own society. \"'Iran' is furious\" declares the article. As if a collective delusion can have an emotion like fury. It's the equivalent of saying 'Christmas is furious' as festive sales drop. 'Iran', like the 'U.S' or 'the West', is a man made construct. If I were to open a lemonade stall at the edge of a market in Tehran and a State official closed it down I might well be furious. This is because there is a principle at stake. He is using the delusion of State power to justify violent coercion to interfere with free and consensual trade between people. It is not a question of scale. My local State official doesn't suddenly become a righteous savior as a function of 'external' threats from even bigger bullies. Not understanding the true source of one's individual 'fury' can easily lead to channeling it into well established estuaries of thought that suit the Statist agenda. We're told \"They were already on the margins before sanctions\" and 'the economy is slumping', but reasons as to why aren't covered in this article. Suffice to say briefly here that the relationship between Statist interference and 'economic slump' is manifest.\n\nSo the 'People' slip into the simple narrative that 'their' State has prepared them for \"I'm not sure what Donald Trump gains by hurting us,\" - the answer is the same thing he, and many, many others gain by hurting you (and the people of the US) - power and control.\n\nIt takes a Statist stooge to complete the delusion in case the 'People' haven't fully conformed to their programming:\n\"There is not going to be a war. Of course, it's possible somebody will make a mistake. But we do not want a war.\" [How easily such a diplomatic statement would sit with the diplomatic jargon of earlier conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_I). Understood as a giant stack of Statist delusions it becomes clearer how each individual justifies his perspective without having to challenge the essential mindset that has created the tinderbox. In other words the diplomat who said this genuinely believes it and is sincere about not wanting to go to war. As are the vast majority of ordinary people. But, given pause for reflection, an ordinary person comes out with:\n\n\"Maybe it would even be better for us if a war happens,\" she said.\n\nI asked: Why would someone want war?\n\n\"It might actually lead to a change in our ruling system. It might lead to a better situation. But if it's going to lead to a civil war then no, it's not going to be good at all,\" she replied.\n\nJust as you might expect from any ordinary U.S./Western person she has forgotten that the real power lies with her and ticked all her Statist master's boxes: 'War could be good', 'I feel the oppression', 'but any kind of **internal** change is out of the question'.\n\nThese guys know that such a line of thinking can easily be harnessed to their purposes:\n\n![iranian_statists.jpg (925x610)](data/img/post_46_iranian_statists.jpg)\n\nBleating about 'oppression' is not a problem.\n\nSame for these guys:\n\n![trump_and_the_military.jpeg (329x153)](data/img/post_46_trump_and_the_military.jpeg)\n\nAs the BBC puts it:\n\n'But when Iran is confronted by America, most Iranians, conservative or liberal, will put their country first.'\n\nSo the answer is that they will think whatever their Statist masters want them to think, which is essentially not to think at all - merely to obey. That is no 'mistake', it is setup that way by design. The only mistake _you_ can make is to fall for it ... (again) ..."

			"body": "Original:\n\n[Police slam ‘untrue, baseless' allegations that checks at MRT stations target Malays](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/police-slam-untrue-allegations-checks-at-mrt-target-malays-11708536)\n\nWe all know that otherwise potentially delinquent, irresponsible and dangerous youths ([in other contexts](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1068316X.2013.772182)) are suddenly transformed into paragons of virtue by the simple application of a costume and their arming with deadly weapons. However, this is hardly new:\n\n![hitler_youth.jpg (612x394)](data/img/post_45_hitler_youth.jpg)\n\nand is unlikely to change over time. What is important is how these young minds are managed and to what end. Youngsters, quite naturally, have a tendency to see the world in less nuanced, more black and white terms. Part of growing up is, of course, coming to terms with reality that doesn't always match our expectations. The cognitive dissonance that results from such episodes can be quite unpleasant and most people therefore try to avoid it. It's comforting to 'know' that your gang is better, more noble, more courageous etc. than who/whatever it is you've been setup to oppose. Simple, comforting but actually quite dangerous if unchecked. History is replete with examples, too numerous to mention here, of the worst atrocities and injustices being committed as a result of an arrogant certainty in the 'righteousness' of one particular idea/race/cause (insert whatever here).\n\nSo what do we _do_ about it? Not easy. What you _don't_ do is imbue these young minds with a sense of invincibility and moral superiority. Growing up in a world in which riding one's electric scooter at 11km/hr is deemed worthy of criminal sanction it must come as quite a revelation that, by the simple application of a costume and the blessing of the Elders, it is not possible for anyone to even _allege_ that you have done anything wrong. Of course, such a circumstance has been contrived by the gang Elders in the first place: 'Don't worry, we've got your back' they can re-reassuringly explain to their young charges; and to prove their total confidence in the arrangement, deadly weaponry will be issued to each and every one of them 'just in case'.\n\nWhen a gang with a monopoly on violence promotes 'peace, harmony and respect' what it really means is 'shut up' if you dare to question our right to rule over you. Imagine I'm a Jew in 1930's Germany and I am beaten up by a gang of SA outside my shop. I go to the 'authorities' and 'allege' that a crime has been committed against me. However, I am put in a cage for 'stirring up racial conflict'. Make sense? Depends who's shoes you're in. From the perspective of the State it makes perfect sense. It justifies it's existence to the 'People' by providing 'protection' services. To the Jew? Which one do you identify with most? Who benefits from this arrangement?\n\nWhen you cannot allege, you have no voice. When you have no voice, you do not exist. If you do not exist then what difference does it make what is done to you?\n\nWho's touting this dangerous idea? Perhaps a more 'grown up' approach would be to demonstrate to these young men that anyone is entitled to allege, but it is the evidence that counts in the end. Taking that to it's logical conclusion is something the 'Elders' are not quite so keen to promote. It takes the shine off the honor and nobility PR tools that allow the whole scheme to justify it's existence ( in contrast to yours)."

Any State, however good it is at dressing itself up in philosophical verbiage. It is entirely dependent upon it. If you disagree simply consistently refuse to pay tribune (they call it 'tax') to your State of choice and wait for your armed reality check to eventually visit. Keep going and you can experience the thrill of armed conflict for yourself.\n\nWar, whatever form it takes, is simply the logical extension of this underlying reality. We're conditioned to oppression via the extortion of our property so some may be inclined to believe it is 'natural'. Conflicts of interest are, of course, an inevitable part of life. From squabbles as children on up. We've all learnt to resolve them in one way or another. Distinguishing between _your_ interests and those of people who have much to gain from widespread conflict is, I suggest, an important issue to contemplate, unless you wish to live in complete ignorance.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that the violent and aggressive bully that demands tribune from you is operating in _your_ best interests when it utilizes the resources of destruction that you have equipped it with to conjure up conflict elsewhere. This is as true, of course, for the people of Iran as much as for the US, UK or almost anywhere else you could care to mention.\n\nWhen these States knock up against each other, discerning all the minutiae of the latest contrivances is unnecessary for _you_ to make a determination. The investigative journalists, diplomats, spies, conspiracy theorists etc. will do their thing, well intended or otherwise, but it's frankly absurd for you, me or the vast majority of people to sift through all the nuances of international relations and honestly expect to have a clear grasp of the entire landscape. We need to understand what lies at the heart of it all, in our _own_ experience.\n\nNeither an Iranian, Venezuelan nor Russian has ever attempted to extort me personally. If I gave them the opportunity, perhaps they would, but you have to deal with the problems in front of you, not those that have been manufactured by your local Statist spokespeople for the extension of _their_ power and 'authority'. If I were to move to any of those countries I expect the Statist officials would be quick to ensure I paid their form of tribune. That _is_ a problem. But it's not one that's going to be solved by taking sides in a game of who can be the most violently aggressive entity on the larger stage of world affairs."

How long before you've traveled down the slippery slope and we have another Christchurch type situation on our hands? Even if you're not so easily manipulated yourself, just think of the millions who are!\n\nOn almost any article you read at this point you will get a series of qualifiers re-assuring the reader of the writer's humanitarian credentials.

[They are often looked upon favorably by the Stat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Arthur_Harris,_1st_Baronet)e. However, this blog is explicitly anti-Statist, so such qualifiers and genuflecting should hardly be necessary. I don't believe in burning people alive and in any of the (de-humanizing) world views regarding other people necessary for bringing such a state of affairs into existence. The first part of that sentence is hardly controversial. The second part is where all the disagreement occurs. How does one go about 'de-humanizing' another? That could be a long discussion, but I suggest it would touch, at some point, on our human ability to communicate our thoughts and feelings.\n\nWhat was the thought expressed by this 'public school official' that led to the destruction of his career? He 'told the parent that he must remain “politically neutral” on the issue'. Obviously a fanatic.\n\nWhat he probably doesn't realize is that the State is the natural and logical locus for psychopathy and to 'serve' it is simply not good enough to 'remain neutral'. State employees must actively embrace the psychopathy of the State to prepare society for it's next 'Holocaust', whatever form that eventually takes, notwithstanding all the 'good intentions' on the way.\n\nHe has sacrificed his career for his intellectual integrity.

I presume this is due, in part at least, to lucrative weapons industry interests. Anyway, the gist to-date has been that Saudi Arabia has been seeking to influence the internal politics of Yemen with military strikes. This is the first report I've seen that demonstrates any kind of push back from one of the factions negatively impacted by Saudi's actions. So now there are two 'sides'. Not just aggressors and victims, but victims on 'all sides of the conflict'. These 'Yemen Houthi rebels' probably haven't considered how the Western media dynamic of their conflict may have suddenly changed in the hands of Western media manipulators. Hardly surprising given their circumstances. However, I suggest that it's now possible for any principle underlying their struggle to be relativised out of existence by whomever is in the most powerful position to do so. Has the Truth changed for anyone involved? No, just perceptions swirling in the media and fed to whichever consumer wants to channel it into his existing, often self-serving, world view.\n\nSo what can I do about it? Study the history and background to the conflict? Deeply appreciate all the subtle religious nuances over hundreds, and even thousands, of years? Admirable you might say. But am I honestly going to do that on a Tuesday morning, when I have work to do and bills to pay? Even if I did, why exactly should anyone take any more notice of my 'insights' than anyone else? Why focus on Yemen? Why not S-E Asia, Brexit or Russia?\n\nWhat's useful, I find, in such circumstances is the consistent application of a principle. It's possible today to scour Wikipedia and peer back over history in a relatively efficient fashion. At each juncture of conflict has one side initiated physical violence to force it's worldview on another? Once someone/group is being violently imposed upon it would be perverse for them not to physically defend themselves.\n\nSuch a 'simplistic' approach is hard for many people to countenance for a very good reason: It brings into question our own condition. For anyone living under the purview of a State and paying tax tribune 'protection' money the threat of physical violence for 'non-believers' is ever present. Of course, it isn't perceived that way which is why it's so much easier to flick through headlines like the one above, shake one's head at the 'madness' in the World, and get back to doing far more work than necessary to keep the violent conflict from our own front door."

I can't think of a single way my life has been enhanced by the existence of unusual sexual behavior throughout history. Is it wrong? Who am I to judge? Should it be stopped?

Vicariously via the State apparatus? That would be dishonest and cowardly.

All great ways to pray at the alter of self-serving bigotry and irresponsibility.\n\nSo how many of the participants of gay pride are going to focus on the extent to which the support of these ideas (voting, strong leaders) is just a tad hypocritical? Very few I suspect.\n\nWhat these 'celebrations' remind us of is how easily distracted we are from things that actually do affect our lives e.g. voting and 'strong leaders'. In virtually every transaction we make we pay tribune (e.g. sales tax) to someone else's idea of a 'good' leader. Or even our own idea of a 'good' leader if we were stupid and irresponsible enough to have voted.\n\nHow do we move away from such bigotry and prejudice 'at a time of discord' (i.e. any given moment in history).

as it currently functions within the State, is a key component in turning the myth of State authority into what appears, for many, to be 'reality'. The only 'reality' that arises from it is a dangerous mental delusion that it is perfectly normal, and acceptable, to use violent extortion against innocent people.\n\nMany imagine that, at the moment of voting, they have exercised their 'power' and that the politicians live in fear of their collective will. At the moment of voting people give up **all** their power.\n\n![voting.jpeg (275x183)](data/img/post_37_voting.jpeg)\n\nThey have publicly stated that their entire contribution to the politics of the world we live in consists of endorsing a politician salivating over the prospect of wielding the power that comes from harnessing the mass delusion.\n\n![hilaryandkissenger.jpeg (318x159)](data/img/post_37_hilaryandkissenger.jpeg)\n\nIf you want a better world you can start by not reinforcing the myth in the minds of armed men, who you do **not** control,\n\n![copsyoudontcontrol.jpeg (800x559)](data/img/post_37_copsyoudontcontrol.jpeg)\n\nthat they are representing your best interests and then discovering that they do not.\n\nBefore decrying everyone else for their 'dumb' voting decisions, take a look in the mirror and think about your own next 'smartest' move. If it involves endorsing the next violent extortionist (no matter how well intentioned he/she appears) by voting, then you only have yourself to blame for the results.\n\nAs ever, Larken Rose manages to [press the point home ...](https://steemit.com/anarchy/@larkenrose/1g6hq514)"

It was then hit by a lot of 'technical' issues and eventually resurfaced as this new, 'improved' version (full of NASA propaganda) and other sanitized posts. I've now been locked out of this new version (along with many others I expect).\n\nAs Corbett [has pointed out elsewhere](https://steemit.com/internet/@corbettreport/jdgqn1m6) the answer to [YouTube et al censorship](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-alex-jones-ban-1202896074/) is [not to equate these businesses with public utilities and demand the State steps in to intervene to uphold free speech](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2018/08/07/in-a-corporatist-system-of-government-corporate-censorship-is-state-censorship/) (as if that would ever be a 'solution' anyway). It is simply to remove one's business and turn to alternative, de-centralized, channels (such as this one or Steemit).\n\nCaitlyn Johnstone is good at explaining how our current mainstream absurd narratives are [cooked up and spewed](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2018/09/05/psychic-nikki-haley-if-there-is-a-future-chemical-weapons-attack-assad-did-it/) out in detail and James Corbett also gives [excellent background and catchup info](https://steemit.com/war/@corbettreport/xwd31ol7).\n\nHow long before they attempt to shut these guys down as well?\n\nUnless we take back control of these narratives oppression, destruction and death will be 'sold' to the public as it has [so many times in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw0-ASR4sr8).\n\nUpdate: 26 Jun 2019:\n\nThe times we live in: [Make sure you're not emotionally affected or motivated by deep sympathy for any narrative that falls outside of State approval](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/three-radicalised-persons-dealt-with-under-isa)."

The following are 14 questions that I hope you will find interesting. Try to answer in order and come to a definite conclusion before moving on to the next:\n\n1\\. Is it ever good to break the law?\n\n2\\. Can you think of a current example of a law that is already wrong? i.e. That it would be right for you not to obey?\n\n3\\. Do you think it's right that you be forced to do things you are opposed to?\n\n4\\. Is there something the gov does with money that you do approve of?\n\n5\\. If someone e.g. doesn't have any children, don't need, don't want education, what should happen to them if they refuse to pay?\n\n6\\. If you would allow them to refuse to pay tax would you extend that Right to everyone?\n\n7\\. Would you apply this to everything on the list of things that people do/don't want? i.e. don't get the service, don't have to pay.\n\n8\\. Is there any situation where gov should make people pay for their version of a service?\n\n9\\. Do you agree it's bad to initiate beating someone up and stealing their money?\n\n10\\. Do you agree people have the Right to defend themselves against someone trying to rob them (including hiring people to defend them)?\n\n11\\. Do you agree there's anything the gov has the Right to do that normal people don't have the Right to do?\n\n12\\. Does morality right/wrong apply the same to people with badges as to those without?\n\n13\\. When it comes to gov, would it even be gov if it doesn't have special rights and powers? i.e. If we're all equal is it even gov any more?\n\n14\\. Can you name anything that you want gov to do that you don't have the Right to do yourself (not ability, Right)? i.e. Anything that would be wrong if you did it?\n\n(inspired by, but with no direct link to, Larken Rose's \"Candles in the Dark/Mirror\" projects).\n\nOnly you know for sure ... If you're not (a Statist) you may find these questions a good starting point for discussion with others ..."

Corollaries of this view are that no-one can assign rights to others that they themselves do not posses and the non-aggression principle (NAP - no **initiation** of violence)\n\n[When we understand that the principle of the State is wrong, it's easier to see how we can easily fall into the trap of arguing in an unprincipled (State like) fashion.](https://steemit.com/anarchy/@larkenrose/time-honored-tyranny-part-3-of-3)\n\n\"But principle has nothing to do with it. Statists have no principles at all. There cannot, for example, be any _principled_ reason to cheer for the “war on drugs” while swigging a beer. There cannot be any _principled_ reason to oppose random searches of people’s homes, if you accept and make excuses for random searches of people’s vehicles. There cannot be any _principled_ basis for objecting to 99% “taxation” if you have already accepted the legitimacy and morality of 1% “taxation.” (Larken Rose)"

Way beyond the scope of a single individual. The Internet has afforded us all the ability to leverage on enormous amounts of information collated and refined by others. I will therefore make reference to some of the sites that I believe may be part of the solution in terms of help us to see what's really going on and how we can perhaps change the direction of the dialectic in our favor.

As a peon you're not supposed to look at such 'higher' issues (not in any detail). Don't leave it to your 'betters' to understand what's going on here. Don't resign yourself to their much longed for war (or be cowed by the threat of it). See the theatrics for what they are. Don't let them use mind control to wear you down so that you almost welcome war because the endless talk is so draining and everyday life has been made deliberately drab.\n\nThe current 'North Korean' sandbox is summed up here:\n\n**after the next North Korean provocation, whether it be a nuclear test or missile test, the US will have this rationale to act…**\n\n> “China and Russia are protecting and enabling North Korea in their effort to build thermonuclear ICBMs that threaten America, so there is no way that ‘multilateral’ diplomacy can stop them. We must therefore act ‘unilaterally’ to put more pressure on the North Koreans. Stopping their ships and seizing illicit cargos will allow us to do this without attacking North Korean territory directly.”\n\nNaturally, this action will lead to disastrous consequences, and the globalists will use this example of **unilateral / unipolar** folly in their effort to sell the [**multilateral / multipolar** New World Order](http://redefininggod.com/understanding-the-nwo-strategy/) (the “new, reformed, strengthened” United Nations). They will say, “If the multilateral UN had had more power to compel the US to stick to diplomacy, this unilateral disaster wouldn’t have happened. We must therefore strengthen the UN to insure that this never happens again.” (Source: [http://redefininggod.com/](http://redefininggod.com/))\n\nDon't fall for this, or any of the other theatrics ...\n\n[6 Nov 2017]\n\n[Watch the show unfold in real time ... afterwards they'll claim it was all 'unforeseeable' and 'accidental' and of course the result of the folly of 'populism' for which Trump is the fall guy](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-ground-invasion-secure-nuclear-weapons-sites-missiles-icbm-test-bomb-chemical-a8038361.html)\n\nDo you hate North Korean people?

She wants to frame the debate from the outset based on her own preconceived perspective:\n\n\"we need a full and frank debate in this country about how such hate-filled, violent extreme right organisations are threatening and undermining the values we hold dear and providing the space from which political extremists could emerge.”\n\nShe wants a debate but no 'space' for people who's ideas differ from her own. Recourse to ['uniformed and undercover protection' (Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Haigh) on state funds is also something we cannot all avail ourselves of (nor should we, we shouldn't be prevented from protecting ourselves).\n\nJust to preempt anyone who might be inclined to fall for the age old divide and conquer techniques and accuse me of being racist let us not forget the freedom enhancing qualities of strong black women like [Sherry Peel Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiYom4-NgAk)\n\n[17 Apr 2018]\n\nHaving children growing up being bombarded with images like this doesn't help:\n\n[![](https://dotnetspec.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/conchita.png?w=300)](https://dotnetspec.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/conchita.png)\n\nAll part of the moves towards turning us into a sexless, colorless, (real) opinionless, mass that can easily be controlled and manipulated into conformity.

If you don't exercise you get weak. If you don't care you get sick.\n\n[10 Jun 2016]\n\nFree speech is a fundamental prerequisite for freedom. It is so fundamental that it should be preserved even where it is purportedly directly linked to harmful acts. It is the acts that are harmful and that may justifiably be punished. The words are an extension of thoughts and can only be harmful where the recipient (the actor) carries out the acts suggested by the words without question. The responsibility rests on each actor to use his own conscience and reasoning before acting on the words of others.\n\nThe Internet is a powerful tool. It is a technology and therefore cannot, itself, be either 'good' or 'evil'. For the reasons stated above freedom haters will want to restrict its use, freedom lovers will resist every attempt to do so.\n\nThe freedom haters don't want to arouse suspicion. So they will do what they have always done. Slowly close the net around the unsuspecting.\n\nHere are some references to that process in action:\n\n[Governments tightening the net](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2014/tightening-net-governments)\n\nThe TPP trade agreement uses commercial issues like copyright and Intellectual Property as an excuse to attack free speech online.\n\n[Investigatory Powers Act](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/snoopers-charter-theresa-may-online-privacy-investigatory-powers-act-a7426461.html)\n\n[21/8/2017]\n\n[I hate to say \"I told you so\" but ...](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/hate-crimes-social-media-crown-prosecution-service-home-office-prejudice-a7903166.html)\n\nWas it really \"confirmation bias\" that enabled me to see this coming? Am I \"cherry picking\" data? Or is it simply the application of the logic of what the \"war on terror\" and all the other freedom hating vehicles (anti-racism, anti-fascism, anti-feminism, anti-semitism etc.) manifests itself as.\n\nThere is a world of difference between disliking someone else's perspective and locking them up for it. Asking the state to do your dirty work is cowardly and irresponsible. The state will be happy to oblige. Who doesn't like more power? It will keep accumulating it until one day something YOU think will be deemed \"unacceptable\". Where will you turn then?\n\nThis is happening NOW.\n\nWhat happens next is up to you....\n\n[30/8/17]\n\n[How your fundamental rights are perniciously removed.](http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/big-tech-can-no-longer-be-allowed-to-police-itself) The [journalist from the Council on Foreign Relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_Foroohar) tells regulators and politicians to 'take note'. No doubt they will, as they always have. The professor quoted at the end gives himself plausible deniability by proposing that \"the CDA be recrafted to \"shield providers from liability for third-party user online conduct only to the extent such providers operate as true passive conduits\".\" Slippery, basically dishonest. Giving a nod to the political juggernaut that wants free speech removed from the Internet and then providing a personal cop out that enables him to claim he never opposed \"true passive conduits\".\n\nNotice how much effort is being made to shift responsibility for removing fundamental rights onto commercial parties so that the politicians and regulators can avoid responsibility for what they're really up to. This is the dishonesty and irresponsibility that has brought us to where we are today in terms of freedom.

If not then you should not and would not be punished in a society that respects and upholds those rights (i.e. enables you to enforce them simply in a court of law).\n\n“<em>Did you really think we want those laws observed? We want them to be broken. ... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt</em>.” - Ayn Rand (a quote from a character in <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>)\n\n[30 Nov 2017]\n\n<a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/activist-jolovan-wham-to-be-charged-today\">We need a license to ask for permission to criticize the State for it's inability to allow us to criticize the State</a>.

When a State outwardly claims that it abides by constitutional declarations such as the right to 'free speech', it can use a plethora of methods legal, social etc. to suppress free speech in <strong>practice</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/li-shengwus-lawyers-to-apply-to-set-aside-court-order-next-ptc-for-contempt-of-court-case\">Here is an example of one State, out of many, that has chosen to use defamation and contempt of court procedures to illustrate the paradox of law to u</a>s. We go, cap in hand (begging), asking the State to protect our freedom by upholding <strong>it's own</strong> constitution. That very same legal system turns around and cages and/or fines those members of the population brave enough to 'perpetrate' a 'contempt of court'. This is law being used, purely and simply, as a tool of oppression.\n\nAre <strong>you</strong> afraid to hear criticism of the State? Are <strong>you</strong> honestly going to start behaving chaotically and anti-socially because you heard something negative said about the State? Are <strong>you</strong> afraid to hold an opinion that differs with lawyers and judges about what can and cannot be said? If so, why?\n\nConsider this: If you disagree with my statements above, should I be able to slap you down with a 'contempt of court'? Or do <strong>you</strong> honestly believe that your master is always right?

Not in the traditional sense of the word. You're not going to live every waking moment in fear if the only crimes are causing physical harm to others (when was the last time you committed a crime like that?). To achieve the required level of fear it's necessary to [extend the definition of a 'crime'](https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/free-speech-and-protest/speech-offences) and [extend the surveillance of your thoughts and opinions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/snoopers-charter-bill-becomes-law-extending-uk-state-surveillance) so that your defiance can be detected and used against you.\n\n[The mainstream media takes the posturing at face value](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/theresa-may-human-rights-act-scrap-terrorism-laws-london-bridge-manchester-safer-a7777216.html). Ultimately, it's not about bad policy decisions or even understanding the links between terror and our arms sales to Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia, although those things are important. It's about you. Your mind. Making sure you understand that even if you harbor a questioning thought, you dare not even contemplate, let alone express, it. They're not there yet (otherwise you wouldn't be reading this). They're driving down a long road in vehicle called 'terrorism'. The journey may have twists and turns, the occasional short cut or delay. But one way or another people who are totally remote to the 'common herd' have a clear conception of their destination.\n\nLike a serial killer's potential victim we need to stop the vehicle, get out and start walking the road back to Constitutional rights against the powers that shouldn't be. Arguing with a serial killer about where you're headed tragically misses the point.\n\nIronically, as is so often the case with a clash of ideologies, they come full circle and I find I couldn't agree more with the [sentiment of Theresa May](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-following-london-terror-attack-4-june-2017):\n\n\"there is – to be frank – far too much tolerance of extremism in our country\"\n\nIf you disagree and dare to write a comment below we might have an \"embarrassing conversation\", but there's one difference I can assure you of. If you commit this \"apparently less serious offense\", I don't have police and security services at my disposal to administer a custodial sentence, no matter how 'extreme' I consider your views.\n\n[5 Sep 2017]\n\n[Buy oil, sell arms, facilitate terror as the motor](https://blog.mdnalapat.com/it-is-time-for-a-grand-alliance-against-wahhabi-terror-671262c44d4b)"
