So I decided to take our [esteemed colleague's good advice](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HBXiufU8RyFMREQa27yM92U329EXrfWvS/?Post:14:GitHub+ZeroNet+Linux+installation+instructions#Comments) and went to [Github](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) where top-right I selected the green 'Clone or Download' then 'Download ZIP file'. Once that was done Ubuntu (the Linux version I was working in) asked me whether and where I wanted to extract, which I did where it said.\n\nThe problems I had before with both Ubuntu and another version of Debian is that the **gevent** and **msgpack** files are missing. Ubuntu has support for these files as webwurst points out:\n\n_\"It seems the package python-msgpack-python exists on OpenSUSE. Ubuntu Precise provides msgpack-python and since Ubuntu Trusty we have python-msgpack.\"_(https://github.com/ceph/calamari/issues/249)\n\nThe easiest way I have found - as a newbie - to get these files is use **Synaptic**. So you'll need to go to _Software_ and search 'Synaptic' which you then install. Once you click on **Synaptic** and enter your password you can then search for **'msgpack'** and **'gevent'** and tick their boxes. Ubuntu will also ask you to install another with a name like 'greenlet', say _yes_ to that. Then click 'Apply' and the installation will begin.  \n\nNow you need to open **Terminal** the same way you opened _Synaptic_, it will already be on your Linux. Here you will need to _navigate_ to the **ZeroNet-master** folder you extracted. You can do so by:\n\n **ls** \n_this will view what is in the current directory (folder) you are in_\n\n**cd** \n_this will change the directory to what you write after it_\n\n**cd ..**\n_remember the space between the cd and the .., this takes you back to the previous directory up_\n\npress [**TAB**]\n_will complete the word you are writing so your don't have to spell it all out whether command or file name: so write **cd ZeroN** and then press TAB to get **cd ZeroNet-master**_ then press Enter.\n\nThis is a brief run through of what I wrote at the terminal (_jon@ubuntumachine:~$_ is similar to what you'll find at the terminal on your machine, you don't need to write it):\n\njon@ubuntumachine:~$ **cd ZeroNet-master**\njon@ubuntumachine:~$ **ls**\njon@ubuntumachine:~$ **./zeronet.py**\n\n\nSo what you do is navigate with the above commands in terminal until you get to the folder that if you **ls** it, you will find **zeronet.py**\n\nTo run **zeronet.py** you need to write in terminal like this ($ means the terminal, you don't write it):\n\n$ **./zeronet.py**\n\nYes, with the **./** in front; and ZeroNet will run. \n\nZeroNet will not pop up in your browser like in Windows. You will have to manually paste or click on the **http://127.0.0.1:43110** link that you see printed for you in the _terminal_ to get to ZeroNet. \n\n"
