# ZeroUp
Yet another enhanced ZeroUp clone. This clone is not intended to allow any user to upload files, but for user who likes to roll her/his own. So it's clonable. Still users can make request through ZeroMessage, and the owner of the zite can add permissions for them by editing data/user/content.json.

You can find my zite [here](/1Dphm8Mth9WYN9fPm1yxj8Y4WhcKRhYXJJ).

Commits before "Dark theme, more file types support, ZeroMessage, restrict upload, etc " are from official and not by me. Git Center can't display the right author name by the method I use copy commit, but if you clone the repo and check the log, you can find that they are from the origin author.
