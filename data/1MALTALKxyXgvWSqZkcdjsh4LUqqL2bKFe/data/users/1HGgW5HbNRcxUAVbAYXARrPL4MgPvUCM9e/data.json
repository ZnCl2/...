Thanks for all your help with this. \n\nIt's been a crazy two months of very little sleep and many times it's probably been our fault for not reading through the docs as well as we should. In some cases, like ZeroTalk, which we are new with, we're not even sure where to find the docs on ZeroNet. But it's great that we're making progress now. \n\nSo, just out of curiosity, how would I delete a post? I can't see any button. Only reply.",
