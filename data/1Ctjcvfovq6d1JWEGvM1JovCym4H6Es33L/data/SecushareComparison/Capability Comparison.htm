This page was originally a feature comparison of existing tools to
what <i>secushare</i> is supposed to deliver on the day we manage to
provide an <a href="https://secushare.org/prototype">implementation</a>.
Looking at other technologies from the
perspective of a developer rather than a user helps figuring out the
strengths and weaknesses of many software solutions. Since several 
people found this comparison useful to choose reasonable intermediate 
tools we are keeping it up to date as a <i>best current practices</i>
recommendation, within the boundaries of our competence. We cannot
guarantee that our analysis is accurate and we welcome feedback to
correct our assertions. This differs from popular
directories such as <a href="https://prism-break.org/">PRISM-BREAK</a> by
the depth at which we look at these tools, excluding several that
we consider unsafe by design.
</p>
<p>
<b>THREAT MODEL:</b> The aims discussed on this comparison page are similar 
to the <a href="https://secushare.org/threats">threat model</a> we elaborated for secushare.
</p>
<p>
<b>GLOSSARY:</b> Some sites including Wikipedia use technical terms in not very scientific ways, so here's a definition how we mean these terms:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Centralized:</b> A single server or a cloud-like server infrastructure operated by a single political or commercial organization or person.
</li>
<li><b>Decentralized:</b> There is no single entity operating the 
network. Politically favorable concerning control and censorship, but 
data may be located in various locations, possibly less safe than when 
centralized.
</li>
<li><a href="https://secushare.org/federation">Federated</a>: Users are 
hosted on specific servers of their choosing, giving those servers an 
augmented insight into user data and especially metadata, making those 
servers single points of failure while still needing to deliver data to 
additional servers over potentially unsafe communication links (X.509 
certification is easier to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/man-in-the-middle">man-in-the-middle</a>). Additionally, people fail to run their own servers whereby popular servers become interesting targets for intrusion.
</li>
<li><b>Distributed:</b> Computer-scientific term to describe how a 
computational challenge, in our case the communication of data, is 
spread over many relay nodes in a redundant, fail-safe and in our case 
content-agnostic way. Good distributed systems take metadata-protecting 
measures typically by onion routing or bulk storage (<a href="https://secushare.org/pubsub">consensus, blockchain</a>).
</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, distributed and federated are opposites – you can't 
have both – and distributed crypto-routing architectures are the ones we
 should invest our efforts on as none of the other approaches deliver 
the needed security properties.
Unfortunately public understanding, traditional pride and motivation is 
lagging behind scientific rationality whereby there is currently more 
work being invested in old-fashioned federated rather than in 
distributed technologies.
</p>
<p>
<b>GENERAL WORD OF WARNING:</b> <a href="https://secushare.org/PGP">PGP</a>, OTR and Tor have all somehow proven to be 
cryptographically secure for certain appropriate purposes, and within certain
expectation limits.
Many technologies mentioned here for "best current practice" however
have not been sufficiently audited for safety. This should be considered
an incentive to do so, since we need more advanced tools as soon as possible.
Still, some things are more likely to be safe by architectural design, like
Ricochet operating in P2P over Tor rather than OTR over <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/XMPP">XMPP</a>.
If you have any doubts on the degree of reliability of these tools, you can always
try to use them in combination with one of the proven technologies: by transmitting
PGP messages via Ricochet for example.

<p>
<b>Link Encryption:</b> Without it, anyone operating your DSL router, local network,
your Internet connection, the Internet backbone or anyone hacking into any of
the involved machines can read in on your activity. You can activate this with
Facebook by using the https: prefix, or, even better, by using the Tor service
at <a href="http://facebookcorewwwi.onion/">facebookcorewwwi.onion</a>
or <a href="http://m.facebookcorewwwi.onion/">m.facebookcorewwwi.onion</a>
(without Javascript). <a href="https://secushare.org/federation">Federated</a> systems use link encryption also in their
<a href="http://about.psyc.eu/interserver">interserver</a> interactions, that unfortunately is frequently an easy
target for man-in-the-middle attacks) given the difficulty to
<a href="http://patrol.psyced.org/">automate certificate checks</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Forward Secrecy:</b> Traffic between endpoints cannot be decrypted
at some later point in time if access to the private key was gained. Recently
this has become the default behaviour of most TLS/SSL links, so it even applies
to Facebook if enabled. Of course, since the data on Facebook exists in the
clear and we now know of PRISM, that is rather pointless when using Facebook.
Same situation with any federated social web or <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/XMPP">XMPP</a> technology. Tor and
GNUnet (as used by secushare) provide for end-to-end forward secrecy additionally
to the link layer. <a href="https://secushare.org/DSNP">DSNP</a>, too, seems to do end-to-end forward secrecy.
Some tools may be affected by the <a href="http://weakdh.org/">logjam attack</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>E2E Encryption</b> goes seamlessly from one person to the other person,
end-to-end as provided by tools such as <a href="https://secushare.org/PGP">PGP</a>, whereas Link
level Encryption enables in-between nodes to access the content,
which is quite unsatisfactory given that these in-between nodes
are unlikely to maintain secure.
</p>
<p>
<b>No Strangers:</b> Most offerings require you to trust a company and the
jurisdictions it operates in and to give it most or all of your data exchanged with
friends. In the case of Diaspora and <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/XMPP">XMPP</a>-based social networks you can
choose to operate your own node or server. Still, as long as some of your
friends use the Diaspora web interface, large parts of your data become visible
to the operators of the web offering, while with XMPP, some of your friends may
be using servers that spy on you. Consider also the virtual machine safety
problem discussed in our <a href="https://secushare.org/2011-FSW-Scalability-Paranoia">2011 paper</a>.
In any of these federation configurations you cannot expect your social interactions
to be safe from bulk collection by global surveillance agencies.
</p>
<p>
<b>Secret Friends:</b> The additional privacy of keeping the information of who is your
friend secret from companies and other complete strangers. You only want your
friends to know, and maybe isolate some groups of friends from each other.
</p>
<p>
<b>Unobservability:</b> Traffic does not allow an observer to understand what kind of
content is being sent. <b>Untraceability:</b> Traffic does not allow an observer to
understand who is talking to whom (also known as <i>metadata protection</i>).
Untraceability and Unobservability may be
considered pointless if you are trusting strangers in the first place.
In the case of Diaspora and XMPP direct encrypted point to point connections are
used that allow for analysis of who may be talking to whom and guessing on
contents of messages. DSNP intends to omit TLS in interserver traffic for
scalability reasons, with the session encryption that it employs it isn't however
completely obvious who is talking to whom, only how much.
Edward Snowden insistently points out that metadata is what we should
protect the most. We think it attacks the foundations of democracy if the
<i>Freedom of Association</i> is digitally foiled and the ability of developing new democratic 
thinking and consensus is threatened by manipulation and outside control.
</p>
<p>
<b>Post Deniability:</b> Do we like that things we said in a comment or status update
can be used against us? Well, in the case of insecure systems like Facebook we
could try to claim somebody else hacked our account. Or maybe we can delete
our mistake before independent testimonies see it. Then again, Utah and KARMA POLICE
are always there ready to haunt us. Some more evolved technologies
make this worse, in particular DSNP that signs every stupid comment with
our private keys. Still we can claim somebody broke into our computers and snooped
our passwords.
</p>
<p> 
<b>Lightweight:</b> To be of maximum use the technology implementing such essential
jobs should be a part of the operating system or close to it, not require large
language engines such as PHP or Ruby and also not require an entire web browser
to be running all the time. This would make it viable for such a technology to
be provided out of the box with certain operating systems on computers but also
on smartphones and other gizmos. Skype probably fulfills this requirement,
although it may not feel that way. Java is a special case - it qualifies as a large
language engine, but if the hosting OS has chosen it as the sandboxing platform
for its apps, then one more Java app doesn't make the difference. Thus some Java
tools can be considered lightweight on Android but not on Linux. DSNP has a routing
backend written in C++ but the social logic is currently implemented in PHP.
Nightweb is web-based. By lightweight we also mean not having heavy duty obligations
towards the network like needing to operate a DHT instead of using it remotely. This
is the case with I2P and also with RetroShare unless operated over <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/Tor">Tor</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Group Encryption:</b> The strategy of sharing a group encryption key with all
participants of a distribution context and occasionally refresh it, especially
when a person leaves the group (or unfriends a person). This makes encrypted
group messaging multicastable and generally more scalable, it also provides
for forward secrecy if done correctly. DSNP implements this with temporary
key pairs. SILC provides this kind of service with either a server- or
client-based strategy. Some scientists have been considering more complex 
methods, such as
<a href="http://goliath.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matt/pubs/mpotr-ccs09/mpotr-ccs09.pdf">mpotr</a>,
<a href="https://equalit.ie/introducing-n1sec-a-protocol-for-distributed-multiparty-chat-encryption/">n1sec</a>
or how <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/Matrix">Matrix</a> handles it. We think, these approaches
are over-engineered, trying to make all participants equal in a
chatroom. In secushare, <a href="https://secushare.org/pubsub">pubsub</a>s and chatrooms are owned
by someone, and it is okay that the encryption is controlled by
that owner. If you don't trust them, why are you in their chatroom?
Still, advanced schemes can be added later, if anybody cares to.
</p>
<p>
<b>Distribution:</b> Efficient delivery to a large number of recipients. Cloud technology
uses multicast-like distribution trees internally between its nodes, whereas
<a href="https://secushare.org/pubsub">multicasting</a> and XMPP is a long sad story. Since 2009 there 
is XEP 0253, but it is rarely used. See <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/XMPP">XMPP</a> for details. Unfortunately
the ability to efficiently distribute data is frequently seen as a business
opportunity, leaving the free world on a slippery slope towards the more efficient
and thus user-responsive cloud technology.
</p>
<p>
<b>Relay Backbone:</b> Servers are nasty if they know everything about you, but
relays are nice when they know nothing, but do everything for you. The <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/Tor">Tor</a>
relay network is a fine example of how much it makes a difference if the service
doesn't depend entirely on the peer-to-peer contribution of the end users from home.
Commercial offerings usually have redundant servers or "clouds" of virtual servers
while <a href="https://secushare.org/federation">federation</a> style systems depend on certain specific server nodes to
be up or redundantly set-up. <i>secushare</i> would use relays in your social neighborhood and
in a Tor-like infrastructure. RetroShare allows nodes to be run as servers, but not in
an agnostic way, so they are likely to have social secrets unencrypted in unsafe memory.
</p>
<p>
<b>Usability:</b> Web-based offerings require users to maintain a password safely.
Federation-based systems additionally require you to deal with domain names and
server addresses. XMPP has the additional problem of not supporting encrypted
contents and cryptographic authentication by default. Neither RetroShare nor
secushare have any of these problems - in exchange RetroShare currently sports
deployment challenges in either getting it to work with Tor or in fixing up
the black- and whitelists for the insecure distributed hashtable, a problem
which is too hard for most users to even understand. Since RetroShare's DHT is
probably impossible to fix we hope that future versions will come with a more
natural out-of-the-box Tor integration experience. In the Tor configuration,
RetroShare uses Tor's DHT, which is also broken, but not as bad.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://secushare.org/features">Features</a>: Does the offering actually provide social network
services or is it just primarily a social framework that needs further work?
</p>
<p>
How <b>Secure Scuttlebutt</b> and <b>Manyverse</b> compares to secushare is explained
in further detail on the <a href="https://secushare.org/answers#scuttlebutt">answers#scuttlebutt</a> page.
What about projects like <b>Human Connection</b> which
<a href="https://secushare.org/centralization">detract so much attention</a> from important projects?
Well, it has a centralized architecture based on nodejs, therefore not
terribly scalable. It will need a lot of money and can only serve serious
numbers of people when run in a cloud. Therefore it puts a few people
in charge of having complete access to the databases. In essence it is
a redo of Facebook, even if well-intended, open-sourced and presumably 
non-commercial. There are dozens of projects of this kind. We were asked
to express an opinion on this one, which, despite its appealing
communication, does not appear to be of much use to society. Also,
when it comes to voting you can no longer leave out
<a href="http://my.pages.de/liquidspin">liquid democracy</a>
without a good reason, these days.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEST CURRENT PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION:</b> Despite the usability criticism above,
RetroShare over Tor is probably the least bad metadata-preserving social
network experience available currently. If the functionality it offers is
too rudimentary for you, the safest bet for privacy unfortunately
still is to use or install a Silo open source project where all data is in the
clear on the web server. Some silo social services are getting popular on the
Tor network as we speak. This means you need a very high degree of trust in the
administrators and even more in the physical placement of the
servers. Servers in data centers may already be integrated in the
XKEYSCORE indexing program without anyone, not even the systems administrator
of the project, taking notice. We discussed that in the
<a href="https://secushare.org/2011-FSW-Scalability-Paranoia">2011 paper</a>.
Federation networks (<a href="https://secushare.org/federation">FSW</a>, <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/XMPP">XMPP</a>) likely make it worse as all the private
data is sent to even more servers, raising the likelihood of falling into the 
wrong hands. <b>Secure Scuttlebutt</b> is a fine choice if you're just looking for
a distributed Twitter replacement. <b>Twister</b> could be another interesting pick
for the same purpose.
We still need to look at it, so it isn't listed in the table.

<b>Mail</b> = E-mail over SMTP with TLS and PGP or S/MIME; <b>GN</b> = GNUnet's GAP-based file sharing service; <b>Tri</b> = Tribler; <b>I2P</b> = BitTorrent over I2P; <b>S@T</b> = Tor Hidden Service using onionshare, ownCloud or similar tools; <b>RS@T</b> = RetroShare over Tor Hidden Services; <b>F2F</b> = Tools making direct connections between friends such as RetroShare and <b>Tox</b>; <b>CJD</b> = FTP or HTTP over cjdns.
</p>
<p>
<b>Link Encryption:</b> Without it, your file transfers can be observed, recorded
and even modified in transit. <a href="https://secushare.org/PGP">TLS between SMTP servers</a>
can be enforced for email, but it isn't transparent to the end user
when an email was transferred safely or when it wasn't. Files could
be transmitted wrapped into <a href="https://secushare.org/PGP">PGP</a>, but then the user and
her mail software have to actually do it.
In XMPP, direct file transfers are usually not encrypted. When sent via servers,
basic wire encryption may be in use on the links, but the servers still
receive the files unencrypted. Not talking of the inefficient encoding.
PGP could be applied to <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/XMPP">XMPP</a> file transfers, too.
See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent%20protocol%20encryption">BitTorrent protocol encryption</a>
about BitTorrent's very basic encryption features.
</p>
<p>
<b>Forward Secrecy:</b> Again this is usually only given if standard TLS
implementations are in use, and only on the link from node to node.
PGP encrypts end-to-end, but does not provide forward secrecy - in
fact it tends to be a forever proof of your deeds online. Traffic in
the cjdns network is only forward secret from malevolent cjdns nodes
if the application protocol offers it (https for example).
</p>
<p>
<b>No Strangers:</b> BitTorrent usually requires a directory service to connect its
users, which is usually run by a stranger on a server. But it doesn't <i>have</i> to
be that way.
</p>
<p>
<b>Untraceability:</b> Should you decide to trust Microsoft or Skype (which in the light
of PRISM isn't very reasonable, but this document was originally written before 
Snowden), observers may still be able to find out who you are sending messages to.
Statistical guessing of file transfer contents is probably feasible, too.
When using I2P, consider that so-called
<a href="https://gnunet.org/i2p_2011_pet">eepsites are easy to de-anonymize</a>.
The <a href="https://gnunet.org/gap">GAP protocol</a> makes GNUnet the best choice for 
censorship-resistant anonymous file sharing.
Tribler has developed a UDP variant of Tor to plug into the distribution torrents,
but we don't know if that is actually deployed among the thousands of current users.
</p>
<p>
<b>Effectivity vs. Overhead:</b> <i>secushare</i> may feel less heavy on people's devices
than traditional file sharing and P2P applications as it grants resources to people 
in your extended social network rather than random strangers. Therefore there is
better motivation to contribute backbone relay resources. Many tools using DHT
technology have no adequate protection against sybil attacks, therefore sender or
recipient could be isolated from the network by an attacker.
</p>
<p>
<b>Distribution:</b> Although optimized for file sharing, BitTorrent creates a kind of
<a href="https://secushare.org/pubsub">multicast</a> distribution tree. Hence its extreme success and popularity.
Several tools such as Tribler, GNUnet and Maidsafe mimick this replication on-demand
approach, which is sufficient for efficient file sharing. Although I2P mentions
multicast in its design documents, so far it has not provided a native
implementation. File sharing using Bittorrent over I2P is rather tedious.
<a href="http://about.psyc.eu/Tor">Tor</a> has no support for one-to-many communication patterns and actively
disincentivates the use of such tools. This is also discussed in <a href="https://secushare.org/anonymity">anonymity</a>.
Retroshare can act as a distribution overlay on top of Tor's hidden services, but 
the efficiency should be similar to using Bittorrent over Tor. cjdns could provide
for <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/ip_multicast">IP Multicast</a> within the limitations of
that protocol.
</p>
<p>
Things left to consider: Reliability, Recovery of incomplete file transfers,
Decentralized redistribution, Usability.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEST CURRENT PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION:</b> Don't entrust sensitive files
onto rented servers.  Running a web server on a Tor Hidden Service in 
your home is a pragmatic way to let people have access to files, but 
expect that your host can be de-anonymized if it is running too long.
You can use web-based tools such as ownCloud or practical ones such as
onionshare or Retroshare. Using Retroshare without Tor is more efficient
but currently not recommendable with all the attacks taking place on the
Retroshare DHT. Tox is facing similar challenges, in both cases the
friend-to-friend (F2F) topology exposes who is friends with whom to observers.
cjdns too does not hide who is talking to whom and even makes it possible
to guess at the contents of messages by their formats. Also the deterministic
routing of cjdns allows central nodes to keep complete history of all traffic
for possible later decryption. Additionally the
cjdns DHT is waiting for attackers to abuse it, as it always is the case
with DHT technology that hasn't been specifically protected against attacks.
GNUnet file sharing works great and has anonymity integrated by design, but it 
is a long way until you have it successfully installed. To just have a pleasant
and successful experience, Tribler is probably the tool of choice for now.

<b>PRISM</b> = Facebook, Facetime, Google Hangouts, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Skype etc; <b>Jab</b> = XMPP-based (Jabber) tools combined with OTR; <b>C</b> = cloud-based systems that offer end-to-end encryption in dedicated clients: crypto.cat, <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdcategory=Internet&amp;fdid=org.telegram.messenger&amp;fdpage=5">Telegram</a>, Signal/RedPhone/SilentPhone; <b>SVPN</b> = SocialVPN; <b>F2F</b> = Tools using the friend-to-friend topology such as Tox and RetroShare; <b>RS@T</b> = RetroShare over Tor Hidden Services; <b>S@T</b>
 = Isolated chat server (be it IRC, XMPP, psyced) over Tor Hidden 
Services. ChatSecure over Orbot can be employed this way, as Orbot is 
the Tor router for mobile phones.
</p>
<p>
<b>Forward Secrecy:</b> OTR provides for safe passage of messages over troubled
waters with end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.
It can be applied to XMPP, IRC, PSYC and several ancient proprietary networks.
This flexibility comes at the price of not being natively integrated into
those communication systems. There is a risk of messages traveling unencrypted
and both Untraceability and Unobservability aren't given. Also the user
experience of OTR is clearly inferior to applications that do end-to-end 
encryption by nature. For example if one user shuts down his laptop
the other user will not be informed that her messages got lost.
Also, many clients have outdated or buggy OTR integration.
You may find yourself unable to do authentication by shared secret.
OTR cannot be applied to other data than chat, therefore it cannot be used 
for file transfers or social network event exchange, which is usually not 
what users expect, with potentially desastrous consequences. OMEMO tackles
that problem at least. <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> sponsors several
XMPP clients with OTR support for Android devices but no IRC clients capable
of OTR. Tox and several of the cloud-based apps provide forward secrecy by
nature, using Axolotl or similar ratcheting implementations. <i>secushare</i>
will do so, too (it's already in GNUnet). This approach is clearly more 
advanced than OTR.
</p>
<p>
<b>No Strangers:</b> So far all chat and messaging applications for I2P depend on a
server offering on the I2P network (which can be running on a machine at home
however), that is why we removed I2P from the listing as it scores the same
as any silo service over Tor.
</p>
<p>
<b>1-1 Deniability:</b> End-to-end messaging between two people should be deniable
by default as it is in real life - otherwise you can't have a conversation
off the record. OTR has a nice logic for that which should be emulated.
</p>
<p>
<b>Reliability:</b> Can you be sure the message made it to the other side? PSYC ensures
this, or lets you know when it fails. So does XMPP when using the proper protocol
extensions, but you also have to use so-called "encrypted sessions" instead of OTR.
Only if all involved clients and servers do this properly, it can work out.
Many other protocols aren't very reliable at all.
</p>
<p>
<b>Group Encryption:</b> The OTR developers are working on multi-party end-to-end
encrypted chats. This affects various commercial messengers as well as XMPP and
IRC. All participants need to be running an OTR-enabled client software.
</p>
<p>
<b>Distribution:</b> SILC uses the single tree multicast strategy inherited
from IRC. Unfortunately it also took the dynamic distributed database problem
with it, therefore it doesn't scale well enough for humanity-wide usage.
</p>
<p>
You are probably familiar with
<a href="https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard">EFF's messaging scorecard</a>
which has received ambivalent appreciation even
from within the EFF. Its greatest shortcoming is that it doesn't even mention
metadata protection (untraceability and unobservability) as a criterion
although that is an absolute requirement for constitutional compliance –
there is no Freedom of Association if it is perfectly known who the people
associating are. Also there is no clear endorsement of free or at least
open source software – instead code audits of proprietary applications are
accepted, which is ridiculous since we have no guarantee that the companies
will actually execute the code that got the review. In fact, past experience
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a>
should teach us the opposite, and 
<a href="https://nadim.computer/2015/06/10/whatsapp-encryption.html">Whatsapp is just</a>
such an example as it <a href="https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/messaging/2014/001133.html">depends on the server</a> whether the end-to-end encryption code is
allowed to execute, which can mean that it never actually does.
Bart Preneel suggests, that
<a href="https://futurezone.at/science/wenn-ihre-daten-in-der-cloud-sind-hat-sie-auch-die-nsa/219.100.024">Whatsapp stores unencrypted back-ups of messages in the cloud</a>
(article in German).
Indeed, for reasons of easier usability a
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/13/whatsapp-backdoor-allows-snooping-on-encrypted-messages">protocol backdoor</a> is provided to do just that.
Of course this will never be used for other purposes!
EFF recommends several applications which we cannot find in F-Droid,
instead it is missing some of the distributed and Tor-based tools listed here.
See also the <a href="https://libreplanet.org/wiki/GNU/consensus/Secure_Messaging_Scoreboard">GNU/consensus secure messaging scoreboard</a> for more doubts on EFF's scoring methods.

There has been plenty of criticism about Telegram making some beginner's
mistakes while rolling their cryptography, but those mistakes got fixed.
<b>Crypto.cat</b> went through similar pains, but for some reasons its even more
embarassing mistakes are no longer talked about. Apparently it is okay to
consider the code "audited" now, so that should also apply to Telegram. Yet,
<a href="http://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-right-now-1782557415">manipulatory false information</a> keeps being published.
We have not seen solid evidence of Telegram not providing safe secret chats,
whereas there is no reason to expect proprietary builds of <b>iMessage</b>
or <b>Whatsapp</b> to provide any secrecy at all, just because apparent whitepapers
describe it that way (that's what the many acclaimed cryptographers that are
praising the privacy of these tools use to judge them, not if the declared
cryptography is actually in those tools at all) and source codes claimed
to be used inside look genuine, but cannot be used or fully reproduced.
</p>
<p>
Since April 1st, 2016, Moxie offers a way to
<a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/reproducible-android/">build Signal in a partially reproducible way</a>
for Android – that means any competent person should be able to recreate
exactly the code that you get when downloading <b>Signal</b> from the Play Store.
Unfortunately, even this reproduction includes <a href="https://blogs.fsfe.org/larma/2017/signal-backdoors/">non-free binaries that</a> cannot be reproduced, so there is still room for a backdoor or change of behavior to be placed deeper in the architecture.
</p>
<p>
Swiss-made <b>Wire</b> App, a VC-funded <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/wire-built-by-ex-skype-employees-retracts-promise-not-to-read-your-messages">company by a former Skype co-founder</a>, is
<a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire-android/issues/5#issuecomment-234947466">suffering from the same problem</a>. As it stands we
<a href="https://f-droid.org/forums/topic/redphone-and-textsecure/">won't be seeing neither Signal</a>
nor <b>Wire</b> on F-Droid.
In the past <a href="https://medium.com/@pepelephew/how-to-intercept-all-wire-voice-and-video-calls-13da1246675c">several security issues were found</a> and <a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/opinion/wire/">confirmed by Waterloo University</a>
 researchers. Those seem to have been addressed and fixed in the 
meantime. Another problematic aspect was that Wire's servers weren't 
located in Switzerland, they were running on Amazon in Ireland, allowing
 the Five Eyes to apply voice recognition and phoneme detection on most 
video calls (as the secure 'constant bitrate' setting is still not the 
default). Some open issues we haven't heard news of since 2016: The 
antique authentication method which makes cleartext passwords available 
to those insecure servers isn't nice. Other people noticed that <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop/issues/115#issuecomment-256196192">Wire downloads the crypto code from the server</a> each time it is used, so the server may <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop/issues/17">not even provide a secure end-to-end implementation</a> in the first place. Apparently, <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop/issues/542">This situation hasn't improved</a>, so there is no safe way to download a Wire client neither for desktop nor for mobile.
</p>
<p>
Whereas <b>LibreSignal</b> is available from
<a href="https://fdroid.eutopia.cz/">Eutopia's F-Droid repository</a>.
It's use <a href="https://zepman.tweakblogs.net/blog/12999/signal-on-android-without-google-play-services">was tolerated for a while</a>, but
<a href="https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/">the project has been discontinued</a>
because of OpenWhisperSystems' unwillingness to provide a platform for free
software. So much for "open". This could just be a sad combination of
circumstances, or it could be a consequence of the <b>U.S. "Freedom Act".</b>
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/08/Signal.html">Who knows if we will ever know</a>.
This isn't a new situation – back in 2012 OpenWhisperSystems
<a href="https://f-droid.org/posts/security-notice-textsecure/">did the same thing</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/282">TextSecure</a>,
the tool for encrypted SMS that doesn't need any servers.
At least a liberated version still exists: <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdcategory=Phone+&amp;+SMS&amp;fdid=org.smssecure.smssecure&amp;fdpage=2">SMSSecure is now called</a> <b>Silence</b>.
</p>
<p>
So the situation is that breadcrumbs periodically come our way but no factual 
guarantees for privacy materialize as we still don't know how to trust 
anything that comes just from the Google Play Store, without independent
verification of successful reproduction. Thus we can <i>NOT</i> join the choir of 
cryptologists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/15/eu-to-crack-down-online-services-such-as-whatsapp-skype-over-privacy">and media</a>
in recommending the use of any of <b>Signal</b>, <b>iMessage</b>, <b>Whatsapp</b>, <b>Wire</b>,
<a href="https://f-droid.org/forums/topic/surespot-encrypted-messaging/">SureSpot</a>,
<b>SilentPhone</b> or its predecessors <b>RedPhone</b>, <b>TextSecure</b> and <b>SilentText</b>
as long as there is no informatical evidence confirming the cryptographic claims.
</p>
<p>
The new <b>Google Allo</b> seems to be just as untrustworthy as Whatsapp.
And then there is a myriad of minor apps like
<a href="https://hannover.ccc.de/~nexus/bubcon/bubcon.html">Bubcon</a>
that you should keep your hands off. Too many to list here.
<a href="https://threema.ch/en">Threema</a> at least has better legal preconditions
for a privacy-respecting operation. Again we are not granted any source
codes to assert any of the claims to be factually true, let alone enjoy
an independent copy from F-Droid. The "open source" mentioned on the website 
only allows you to make apps that use <b>Threema</b>, so it is like Skype's API.
</p>
<p>
In order to get a reasonable user experience together, most of the 
above apps share a need to build the initial network of
people to communicate with, so they typically do an upload of the
user's telephone contact register. <b>Signal</b> seems to have solved this
in a more elegant way, using a
<a href="https://gnunet.org/blip">bloom filter match-up</a>, which means that
the server only sees the numbers it already has from other users.
Yet, it is the only one to have been
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2017/03/signal-leaks-your-phone-number-to-everyone-in-your-contacts/">observed to also match up e-mail addresses</a>.
This can lead to the embarassing situation that people, who you only
had mail contact before, are given access to your phone number.
</p>
<p>
The good news about <b>Riot.im</b> is that you can <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=im.vector.alpha">get it on F-Droid</a>. The not so good news is that it runs on <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/Matrix">Matrix</a>, which is a <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/Federation">federated</a> architecture, not distributed. The resulting <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/spec/appendices.html">threat model</a>
 is a bit scary as neither distributed nor cloud systems suffer from as 
many deficiencies. It's the same problem with XMPP and psyced, really.
</p>
<p>
<b>F-Droid</b> itself is not a long-term secure solution. There may be
ways to influence how it operates or man-in-the-middle attack its
communications with the repositories, so the really honest answer 
should be: Android devices are never really secure. Building your own 
Android packages (apk) and copying it over by USB is the best you can 
do. Even then you trust your device not to be preemptively backdoored,
but so far we have no reason to assume such backdoors would be used for
systematic bulk surveillance in a way akin to <b>Microsoft Windows 10</b>
whose contribution to society is that even that assumption has fallen.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEST CURRENT PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION:</b> The current situation is tricky:
privacy-aware people are using <b>OMEMO</b> or <b>OTR</b> over very few XMPP servers in order to avoid
XMPP <a href="https://secushare.org/federation">federation</a> which leaks metadata information and allows for timing
and statistical attacks. Unfortunately these large servers are frequently 
collapsing under their load. Also, why should the meta data be safe on such
servers? All the recommendable alternatives are very experimental: It
is still not trivial to configure either RetroShare or psyced to operate
over Tor Hidden Services, yet the result is a trustworthy distributed chat
system. There are also solutions over I2P and Freenet, each with their pros
and cons. Recently <b>Ricochet</b> is getting more attention, as it operates in
P2P over Tor. Probably the best choice at this given moment in time as it
protects metadata and is very easy to install.
<b>Briar</b> employs a similar strategy to Retroshare and Ricochet using Tor.
If it has to be on a smartphone and almost hassle-free, then <b>Telegram</b> can
be among the least worse:
You should install an independently built binary from F-Droid.org, then ensure
you are using "secret" chats and compare the graphical key representations
between the devices to ensure the chat is indeed secret. Remember that your
metadata is however exposed by such a set-up and group chats are unencrypted.
Telegram also has that awful habit to upload your phone address book to the
company, just like Whatsapp. Authorities can infiltrate your account, but
that is a given with several of these tools – still, that doesn't empower
them to read into your secret chats.

<b>PRISM</b> = Faceboogle and similar web-based cloud services; <b>PM</b> = PGP over SMTP (E-Mail); <b>BitM</b> = Bitmessage; <b>Bri</b> = Briar.
</p>
<p>
Effectivity in this case also means protection from SPAM and ability to deliver
when two people aren't online at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Distribution:</b> <b>Bitmessage</b> uses large subscription-based streams shared
between many nodes peer-to-peer containing metadata-free ciphertext
contributed from many sources. Recipients attempt to decrypt all
messages in the incoming subscribed streams whereby it is not 
observable which messages were actually received by whom. A pretty
rough but effective method to achieve unobservability. It comes at a
price in terms of network overhead and proof-of-work
computation. <b>Briar</b> and <b>Retroshare</b> use opportunistic replication of
content, that means that if an intermediate node is not interested
in a certain forum it may cut out people behind it from receiving
the content.
</p>
<p>
With the current <a href="https://secushare.org/anonymity">weaknesses in the Tor hidden service implementation</a>,
<b>Pond</b> servers can easily be targeted for denial of service, infiltration
or physical subversion – especially since most Pond users allocate
their identity on the default server. As
<a href="https://pond.imperialviolet.org/threat.html">Pond's threat model</a>
states there are several possibilities to de-anonymize the social
graph of users once the server is under an attacker's control. The
actual content of the messages however is presumeably safe and the
usability is pretty good. Also it is said to be easy to set up your own 
server, but that is not a solution to the <a href="https://secushare.org/federation">federation</a> dilemma.
</p>
<p>
Concerning usability, <b>Bitmessage</b> suffers from a lack of natural
integration of the BM addressing, which when used for broadcasting
actually is also the key information needed to access the content,
making it too easy for people to accidently share cryptographic
key material over unsafe means, exposing the content discussed in
a working group to a global passive attacker without anyone knowing
it has happened. Interestingly the metadata of silent listeners is
still secured making Bitmessage more akin to radio or television.
Retroshare's current usability problems were discussed earlier.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEST CURRENT PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION:</b> PGP is better than nothing,
but there are <a href="https://secushare.org/PGP">several reasons why PGP over SMTP</a>
provides less safety than other tools. Various stop-gap strategies
such as pEp, LEAP or keybase.io only address a few of that long
list of problems with PGP. cjdns can wrap an outer encryption layer
around the SMTP backbone, but it still relies on the safety of
servers and the good-will of the other nodes in the cjdns network
while allowing for de-anonymization and statistical analysis of
mail patterns. Bitmessage instead is a
metadata-protective communication tool that scales for 
thousands of recipients of a single message source (through the 
built-in "broadcast" feature). Retroshare and Briar can in theory 
be used in a similar way, using private invitation-only forums,
but the method is actually very prone to attack traffic, which
required Bitmessage to introduce proof-of-work computations as a
deterrent. Regarding anonymity, Retroshare and Briar are placing
their bets on Tor instead.
It's easy to use Bitmessage the wrong way, like having law enforcement read your
private discussion groups once any participant has forwarded its address over
insecure means such as e-mail, SMS or Whatsapp, so 
<a href="https://archive.is/mLE5c">don't use it for criminal purposes</a>. It takes 
serious discipline of all participants to maintain Bitmessage groups secure.
Another viable alternative is I2PBote for as long as nobody tries
serious attacks against its unsafe DHT implementation, which is
generally the problem with most tools that employ a DHT somewhere
in the stack without taking dedicated safety measures.
The usability challenges vary, none of the tools is free of problems.

<b>Flash</b> = Adobe Flash's RTMP and RTMFP technologies; <b>WRTC</b> = libre WebRTC-based tools such as palava.tv; <b>Jab</b> = XMPP-based tools, typically using Jingle; <b>C</b> = Cloud-based platforms such as Skype but also including <a href="https://webrtchacks.com/tag/blackbox-exploration/">proprietary WebRTC-based ones</a> such as Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and FaceTime; <b>SVPN</b> = SocialVPN; <b>RS</b> = RetroShare; <b>M</b> = Mumble; <b>M@T</b> = Mumble over Tor Hidden Services; <b>GN</b> = GNUnet's conversation (to be integrated into secushare).
</p>
<p>
<b>Multicast:</b> Flash-based conferencing can use a push-to-talk user interface and
decentralized servers in multicast configurations (at least that's what we do
at <a href="http://symlynx.com/">symlynX</a>), so it can be scalable. Other platforms typically
provide for continuous stream conferencing which requires plenty of network
bandwidth and has limits on the number of people that can take part.
Again it's a question of multicast, so we consider it long-term feasible for secushare.
</p>
<p>
<b>E2E Encryption</b> (end to end) could be applied to telephony negotiated over
XMPP, the way Jitsi does it, for example.
Involved servers get to know who is calling whom, though.
WebRTC has a notorious problem in authenticating communication counterparts
in a cryptographically safe manner, so there's always a possibility for
a man-in-the-middle attack during DTLS negotiation.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEST CURRENT PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION:</b> For an untraceable conversation,
a torified Mumble can help, using a Mumble server on a hidden service
that is ensured to be safe from surveillance (that means, not on a
<a href="https://secushare.org/2011-FSW-Scalability-Paranoia">cheap virtual hosting which can have XKEYSCORE-friendly automated server memory monitoring</a>) or
installed in a way that it cannot easily be found. This, thanks to
push-to-talk, even works for conferences. Long-term use of such a
configuration could however be detected by traffic correlation.
If it isn't so important to hide who is talking to whom, then 
Jitsi over XMPP should be okay. Also using the telephony capabilities
of RetroShare or SocialVPN. WebRTC's DTLS would be fine too, if you find a
way to exchange authentication data safely. For example using a webserver on
a Tor hidden service. Or you can try classic VoIP technology over cjdns.

<b>PRISM</b> = Facebook, Facetime, Google Hangouts, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Skype etc; <b>Jab</b> = XMPP chatrooms using MUC over federation; <b>IRC</b> = oligarchic networks using the historic Internet Relay Chat protocol; <b>S@T</b>
 = an isolated chat service (be it IRC, XMPP, psyced) behind a Tor 
hidden service operated in a trustworthy manner, not a P2P Tor 
application (none offer chatrooms yet); <b>CJD</b> = an IRC server running on somebody's cjdns node.
</p>
<p>
<b>Moderation</b> (also known as <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/Conference%20Control">Conference Control</a>)
 is the ability to manage behaviour of participants, which unlike in 
physical life is a true necessity in the digital domain for ensuring a 
productive environment (Insert suitable explanatory links to research 
papers here). This is frequently confused with censorship, although 
there is quite a difference. Retroshare by design cannot moderate its 
chatrooms. If there is a problem you have to make a new closed 
membership chatroom and make sure you only invite the right people into 
it. This is difficult if your policy is to let people in until they 
misbehave.
</p>
<p>
We removed Skype from the table as it essentially behaves like a Cloud 
offering by now. It apparently was a secure chat system  in 2003, but 
that is long gone. The reasons why public <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/IRC">IRC</a> networks score pretty badly is described in the link. Similarly XMPP with its <a href="https://secushare.org/federation">federation</a>
 architecture. Standalone servers behind Tor or I2P score better than 
nothing while Retroshare currently is the only tool we know that offers 
truly distributed chat, but has terrible issues with its <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/DHT">DHT</a>
 instead. Also the distribution strategy is opportunistic and depends on
 the local social graph, so if your social uplink isn't running you may 
find yourself cut out from the chatroom. Retroshare people usually 
resolve this by adding a persistent server to the chatroom, but that 
defeats the whole purpose of having a distributed chatroom if once again
 a server needs to be trusted to keep all the conversation secret.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEST CURRENT PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION:</b> We are working on it, but secushare
isn't ready yet, so until then the least worst configuration is a standalone
chat server on a Tor hidden service address. You can pick <a href="http://about.psyc.eu/psyced">psyced</a>
which offers IRC, XMPP, telnet and webchat access protocols plus native PSYC -
so it isn't as barebones as running a regular IRC or Jabber server.

¹) Footnote regarding the <b>✖</b> symbol in the tables: Trusting third parties is one thing, but that doesn't mean they took enough provisions for securing <a href="https://secushare.org/2011-FSW-Scalability-Paranoia">the involved server</a>.
 Also consider that access to such a server may have been gained without
 the administrator knowing. Architectures that require trust in the 
administrator should not be developed further but rather sooner than 
later be replaced by fully distributed solutions that empower the user 
to not have to trust anybody.
