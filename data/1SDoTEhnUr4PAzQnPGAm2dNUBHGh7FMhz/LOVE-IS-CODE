LOVE IS CODE

( the journey of a young coder )

co-der n. one who prays on code

We met in high school.

Forgive the cliche, but it was love at first sight.

She told her name was Missy Basic, but all her friends called her Q.

We grew apart.
---

My confidence had grown by the time I met Lady Pascal.

She was such a whore; everyone called her Turbo.

But what she talk me about 3D graphics was truly magical.

As dirty as she was, we continued our affair for months.

Then one day I saw a doctor; he gave me a shot; and I felt better.
---

I saw Q, we talked for hours.

She invited me over for dinner with her family.

She walked in.

She insisted I call her V.

Q tried to take me away, but I refused to stand up.

V was the hottest thing I'd ever seen and if I'd stood up, everyone would've know it.

Harriet Thomas Mary-Lou

She'd seen the world.

She knew it ALL.

We would talk for hours as if it was only just a moment.
---

My parents insisted it was time to settle down.

Enough with the fun and games, it was time to find a life partner.

I met Charlette in a bar one night.

Her parents were on her too to grow up.

We bonded instantly.

She came with baggage, two pluses to be exact.

This bitch wouldn't shut up.

Allocate this, structure that.

Fuck that! I went for coffee.. I never came back.

The twins Java and Script.

As I had learned, you can often grow tired of even the sexiest of syntax.

When Java turned me off, Script was right there to get me off.
---

If two is great, then why not three!

Pamela, Hiroshi and Pae.
---

I decided to go back to the twins.

I feel its where i belong.

I learned that "Life is Good; and Love is Code"
