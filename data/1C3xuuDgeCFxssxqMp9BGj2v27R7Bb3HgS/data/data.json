I don't care what they do with the books, they can read them, sell them or throw them away, but I'm hoping they read, then sell.\n\nDoes anyone here have any ideas for refining this plan, anything to input regarding what I should do or change?\n\nI got my inspiration for this idea from the [Pavement Bookwork (CSMONITOR, clearnet link)](https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2014/0625/Video-of-homeless-South-African-the-Pavement-Bookworm-goes-viral)"

Trotsky joins his voice to this chorus of social democrats. The \"Left\" social democrats have invented a special theory that the circumstances of the crisis create not a revolutionary but a counter-revolutionary situation. Therefore, they say, the working class can onl<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">y conduct a defensive but not an offensive struggle!</span></span>\n\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<span display=\"inline\">It is easy to grasp the full, traitorous import of such counter revolutionary inventions. The crises sharpens all the contradictions of capitalism to the utmost. It is in just such circumstances that the social democrats come out as 'healers' at the bedside of sick capitalism. They proclaim their task to be, not to help in burying capitalism, but to help in 'curing' it. Paralysing the revolutionary energy of the workers they thus open wide the door for the victory of fascism, as was clearly demonstrated in Germany.\"</span>\n\n</div>"
