			"body": "# Contributing To This Wiki\n\nIn order to make sure the navigation remains consistent, follow the below guidelines on where to link new pages:\n\n1. Select a main, general topic -\n    * These general topics are listed on the homepage. They include: [[ZeroNet]], [[Internet]], [[Cryptography]], and [[Programming]].\n    * As a general rule, if something is different enough to not fall within one of these topics, then make a new topic.\n    * Another general rule, if it needs to be further subdivided into categories, then *chances are* it should be a topic.\n2. Categories/Groups (if applicable) -\n    * These categories/groups further divide the general topics. For example, the [[ZeroNet]] topic has these subtopics: [[Zites]], [[ZeroNet Plugins]], and [[Well-Known Developers]].\n    * However, not everything listed in a topic must be a category or group. You can have pages that don't have pages below it in the hierarchy.\n    * If something doesn't fall within one of the current categories, create a new category.\n3. If you are creating a new Category/Group or a new page within in a Category/Group, do the following:\n    * Make sure you are adding the title of the page or category/group at the top using a heading (`# `).\n    * Please put a vertical bar with a link to the Category/Group or Topic after the title for pages inside of a category or categories/groups.\n4. Other Guidelines\n    * All other heading on a page should be sub-headings, starting with `## `\n    * When linking to zites, be sure to remove `http://127.0.0.1:43110` at the beginning (but retain the `/` at the start).\n    * Only Topics on the homepage are allowed to put some of the subpages below them. The amount of subpages should be limited to the top 5-6 pages that would be most useful on the homepage. Be sure to add a `See More` link if more subpages exist within the topic page.\n5. You can link to related pages by putting them under a `See Also` heading.\n\n*It should be noted that currently this Wiki only deals with technology topics. In the future, I may rename topics to sub-topics and create new topics that are more general and cover other areas, like Politics, Art, etc.*",
