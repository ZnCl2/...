			"body": "The 7th Floor Group was the term used by an unnamed individual to discuss a group of officials as allegedly meeting regularly to discuss Clinton-related Freedom of Information Act requests. The term appeared in an FBI investigation report on the Hillary Clinton email controversy. Instead of following the State Department's usual procedure of rolling releases of FOIA documents, the group allegedly wanted to release them all in January of 2016. They were overruled by the State Department Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).[1]\n\nThe documents include an interview with an unnamed individual, who suggested that Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests related to Clinton went through this alleged group: \"There was a powerful group of very high-ranking STATE officials that some referred to as \"The 7th Floor Group\" or \"The Shadow Government.\" This group met every Wednesday afternoon to discuss the FOIA process, Congressional records, and everything CLINTON-related to FOIA/Congressional inquiries,\" the FBI's interview summary said.\"[1]\n\n#References\n\n1 Rosenfeld, Everett (17 October 2016). \"New FBI release on Clinton email probe refers to 'Shadow Government'\".
