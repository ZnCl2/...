Sites have specific addresses which can be accessed through a browser when using its client. ZeroNet is not [[anonymous]] by default, but users can hide their IP address by using the built-in [[Tor]] functionality. ZeroNet uses elliptic curve [[cryptography]] and the [[BitTorrent]] network.\n\nUsers can publish static or dynamic websites into ZeroNet and visitors automatically serve the visited website from their computer, with the option to stop serving the website at any time by either pausing or deleting it. Sites will remain online even if it is being served by only one [[peer-to-peer|peer]].\n\nWhen changes are published by the site owner, connected [[nodes]] serving that site (previous visitors) will receive the updates done to the site's content.\n\nZeroNet comes with a built-in [[SQL]] [[database]]. This makes content-heavy site development easy. The [[database]] is also synced with hosting [[nodes]].\n\nThe existence of [[peer-to-peer]] online [[website|websites]] had been hypothesized for some time, with [[The Pirate Bay]] suggesting they would build such network, as well as [[BitTorrent Inc.]] which created the closed source [[Project Maelstrom]]. One other similar project is [[MaidSafe]], though it has not yet seen widespread use, and has been said to focus more on file storage.\n\n* [[zite|Zites]]\n* [[Zite Categories]]\n* [[Well-Known Developers]]\n* [[ZeroNet Id Providers]]\n* [[ZeroNet Proxies]]\n* [[ZeroNet Plugins]]\n* [[ZeroNet Functionality]]\n* [[Development Ideas]]\n* [[ZeroNet Releases]]",

Select a main, general topic -\n    * These general topics are listed on the homepage. They include: [[ZeroNet]], [[Internet]], [[Cryptography]], and [[Programming]]\n    * As a general rule, if something is different enough to not fall within one of these topics, then make a new topic.\n    * Another general rule, if it needs to be further subdivided into categories, then *chances are* it should be a topic.\n2. Categories/Groups (if applicable) -\n    * These categories/groups further divide the general topics. For example, the [[ZeroNet]] topic has these subtopics: [[Zites]], [[ZeroNet Plugins]], and [[Well-Known Developers]].\n    * However, not everything listed in a topic must be a category or group. You can have pages that don't have pages below it in the hierarchy.\n    * If something doesn't fall within one of the current categories, create a new category.\n3. If you are creating a new Category/Group or a new page within in a Category/Group, do the following:\n    * Make sure you are adding the title of the page or category/group at the top using a heading (`# `).\n    * Please put a vertical bar with a link to the Category/Group or Topic after the title for pages inside of a category or categories/groups.\n4. Other Guidelines\n    * All other heading on a page should be sub-headings, starting with `## `\n    * When linking to zites, be sure to remove `http://127.0.0.1:43110` at the beginning (but retain the `/` at the start).\n    * Only Topics on the homepage are allowed to put some of the subpages below them. The amount of subpages should be limited to the top 5-6 pages that would be most useful on the homepage. Be sure to add a `See More` link if more subpages exist within the topic page.\n5. You can link to related pages by putting them under a `See Also` heading.\n\n*It should be noted that currently this Wiki only deals with technology topics. In the future, I may rename topics to sub-topics and create new topics that are more general and cover other areas, like Politics, Art, etc.*",

The website owner has to enable this in the site's [[content.json]] by setting the boolean \"`cloneable`\" to \"`true`\", then [[signing]] and [[publishing]] it.\n\n## *-default files\n\nFiles with `-default` suffix will be copied instead of their equivalent without this suffix. For example, if their are both a `data` and a `data-default` directory in the zite, only the `data-default` will be copied. It's commonly used to avoid having a lot of useless data being copied, like articles in [ZeroBlog](/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit).",

			"body": "# Tor | [[Internet]]\n## What is Tor?\n\nTor is a service that helps you to protect your anonymity while using the Internet. Tor is comprised of two parts: software you can download that allows you to use the Internet anonymously, and the volunteer network of computers that makes it possible for that software to work.\n\n## Who created the Tor network?\n\nThe core principle of Tor, \"onion routing\", was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson and computer scientists Michael Reed and David Goldschlag, with the purpose of protecting U.S. intelligence communications online.\n\nNowadays the software is maintained by the [Tor Project](https://torproject.org) and has stemmed into several child projects based on it, such as the TorBrowser (for desktop systems) , Orbot (for Android systems) and others.\n\n## Is it illegal to use the Tor Browser?\n\nUsing Tor to browse the Internet is not illegal. \nHiding your IP address and browsing history is not illegal in and of itself. \n\nHowever, don't forget that the concept of legality varies according to the laws of a given place. The above is true for the United States, and probably for most of Europe and South America as well, but might be different for your country.\n\n## How do you connect to the Web through the Tor network?\n\nThe simplest way is using the Tor Browser Bundle which contains all the required tools. To install it, go to [www.torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org) and download the appropriate file for your operating system. (Check the PGP signature of the downloaded file to verify integrity). Run the downloaded file, choose an extraction location, then open the folder and click Start Tor Browser.  Depending on where you are, you may need use bridges such as obfs4 or meek-google.",

			"body": "# Zites\n\nA Zite is a [[ZeroNet]] [[website]]. Zites have the notable difference of being entirely [[decentralized]] and work even if the visitor is offline. Zites are designed to be entirely [[open source]] and freely shared. Zite owners can also make their site [[cloneable]]. This ensures content is not censored and cannot be forcefully taken down.\n\nHowever, due to how the site is distributed and viewed, sites must be entirely contained within local [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]] files. Information for the site can be stored in an [[SQLite]] database or in [[JSON]] files.\n\nZites require the private key generated with the address in order to be edited or published. Users of the zite have a subdirectory they may edit within the zite's file structure.\n\n[KEEP THIS?]\n[ZeroTuto](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Jtjb5CU9aod4jtz8hF5NPPqFKofRSsb4x/), is a great resource for creating zites.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to index and search the hundreds of zites that have been created. [[Search engine|Search engines]] like [[Kaffiene]] or [[ZeroSearch]] allow searching through hand-crafted indexes using key terms. While other zites, like [[0list]] or [[ZeroCentral]], allow user submissions to generate a list.\n\n## See Also\n* [[Zite Categories]]\n* [[Well-Known Developers]]\n* [[Creating Zites]]\n* [[Search engine|Search engines]]\n\n### Well-Known Zites\n* [[ZeroTalk]]\n* [[ZeroMe]]\n* [[ZeroBlog]]\n* [[ZeroMail]]\n* [[ZeroSites]]\n* [[ZeroUp]]\n* [[ZeroUpdate]]\n* [[0list]]\n* [[ZeroWiki]]\n* [[Git Center]]\n* [[CodeR]]\n* [[ThunderWave]]\n* [[Important Zites]]\n* [[ZeroNet Dev Center]]\n* [[ZeroMedium]]\n* [[ZeroDB]]\n* [[ThunderWave]]\n* [[Kopy Kate]]\n* [[KopyKate Big]]",

Feel free to click any link you see in the texts too, they will take you to magic places.\n\nBlue links will take you to existing pages which already have content and intersting things for you to read. On the other hand, red links will lead you to pages that do not exist yet, you will be able to add content and write some spells to create them.\n\nMost of the pages in this wiki are editable too! just look for the Edit button if you feel the urge to modify what you are reading. This is a collaborative tool for shared knowledge, improve the contents, show your kung-fu, and the community will be grateful forever with dances and songs to remember your feat.\n\n## Text editing\n\nThis wiki uses Markdown to format the texts, use it to add titles, to make your text bold or to add links to external resources.\n\nTo create links to new or existing pages in this wiki, just use double square brackets around words. The wiki will auto-magically convert it to wiki-links. It will also detect if the page already exists and use the corresponding color to display the link.",

It was created before [[ZeroSites]]. You were able to select a category from a menu on the side to filter out the list.
