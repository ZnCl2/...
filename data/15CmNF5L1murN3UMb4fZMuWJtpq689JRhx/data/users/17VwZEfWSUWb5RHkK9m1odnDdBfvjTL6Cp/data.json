			"body": "I think we should make the hash collection an independent project. Than we may be able to convince people not interested in ISR to contribute hashes to our collection.\n\nI think creating a kind of web of trust for hashes is a good idea in itself. Probably, there are people who would contribute even if they are not interested in ISR. \n\nThere are important features our collection misses now:\n- being clear-cut (we only have a few hashes so far , but it is already quite chaotic)\n- being searchable\n- being a real database (or at least one that is easy to turn into one)\n- being easily able to tell the distribution of hashes of a certain file. \n- having a form that contributors should fill in to submit data (to make the collection as clear-cut as we can)\n- having a gazillions of contributors. \n- encouraging everybody to always hash the software they acquire, compare the hash to the official site and/or our database, and of course to contribute the data to our database (even if it differs from the majority of our collection!). \n- a safeguard that our database is not compromised (this is a though but important one, maybe a strong user base and an alert system that makes easy to track changes comparing the Zites version to the users saved versions could be a kind of solution). \n\nThere are some features on http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroTorrent.bit/ which we may implement, but we should do that wisely. Simply cloning it and changing IMDB id to SHA256 sum is really fare from a good solution.",

Thoughts?\n\nIt depends, what is the purpose of this hash database. \n\nIf the only aim is to get at least 3+ independent verification of the hashes for the [ZeroISR](http://127.0.0.1:43110/12oGb8xBjLYz23CGJxRQyzZ6mGybZokEKt/), then maybe it is better if we have only a few topics (but even then I'm not sure because that way we lose the possibility to automatically compare the hashes we have collected, see below). \n\nHowever, if we would like to have an ever growing sha256 and md5 sum database that worth to be checked even if someone downloads the software from somewhere else, then I think it is better if one topic contain only the hashes of one file. That case it is important to have a really easy way to see what is the distribution of the hashes of a file (hopefully it is a trivial distribution and there is only one hash several times).\n\nOf course, if we are aiming to create that it should be also searchable, as for example http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroTorrent.bit/. (It would be even better if it were really a database, that is a problem for an other day...)  \n\nAnyway, a great benefit of having a different topic for every file is then it is really easier to check if all the hashes are the same there or not. And if not, it is easier to see what is the distribution of the hashes. \n\nFor example, if all.txt contains all the text of a topic, then the \n`sed -e 's/.*[Mm][Dd]5/md5/' -e '/md5\\:/!d' all.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort`\nbash command creates a list of hashes where it is really easy to tell if some of them is different or not. \n\nRight now applying it to the [The Tor Browser Bundle Thread](http://127.0.0.1:43110/15CmNF5L1murN3UMb4fZMuWJtpq689JRhx/?Topic:1_1CMjV2r4EBpFt8VCcWWZKDysZXPcPExRNN/+Desktop+Software+The+Tor+Browser+Bundle+Thread) the result is:\nmd5: 4ff8c08394cdb42198b7f2fada600455\nmd5: d4b74112374b75b38a8174b1d37086fe\nmd5: d4b74112374b75b38a8174b1d37086fe\nmd5: d4b74112374b75b38a8174b1d37086fe\nmd5: d4b74112374b75b38a8174b1d37086fe\n\nNow you can see without any real effort that 1 of the 5 hashes is different from the rest. (Of course, here the reason for the anomaly is that one of the hashes corresponds to the Linux version). However, if they were the hashes of the same file, then it would mean that something fishy is going on so we should collect more data to decide which hash is trustworthy.\n\nNote that, however, even if these 5 hashes corresponded to the same file, it would be dangerous to assume that the single 1 is the wrong and the other 4 is the right, because maybe the source was compromised when we collected the first 4. So the right attitude were not trusting any of them until we have collected more data.\n\nSo probably it is better, to have a different topic for every file independently how ambitious our aims are with this database. \n\nHave I convinced you?",

How about stating it on the Zite in a separate first paragraph formulated as:\n\"Our primary aim is to make important software accessible to everyone everywhere.\"\n?\n\n>This means that if the videolan website dies forever, or for some reason is compromised (think hackers or censorship), there will always be at least one verified genuine installer for VLC on ISR.The secondary reason is more due to the hacker/censorship/NSA sort of thing. We hope (yes, just hope) that the software we all know and love is not compromised at the moment. We can support this hope by the fact the many people across the world are using the same file as us. The reason this makes us feel better is that if, say, the NSA built a backdoor into bitmessage, they likely wouldn't do that for servers outside the US. Instead, they would more likely just redirect US website visitors to their own page, complete with compromised download.This is why the file hashing is important. It tells us that we aren't being sent a fake file (or at least everyone is, but we hope that's less likely).  For all intents and purposes, going to the official site to download might still be a good idea if you are able. Then take that link and cross check the hash against our table.   \n\nThis is part is a bit confusing. For example, \"the website dies forever\" is quite an extreme case. So I'm not sure it is a good idea to use that for illustrating why our collection is useful. I think we should use more everyday situations here as government censorship and MitM/DDoS attacks. Also I'm not sure  VLC is the best example to be used in the illustration. I love VLC, but I'm not sure that is among the most endangered important software.\n\nThe secondary reason also rises several questions: \n- Isn't \"supporting hope\", \"makes us feel better\", etc. are misleading terms? Mallory and NSA want people \"to feel secure\". We should want them \"to be more secure\". See Bruce Schneier's [The security mirage](https://www.ted.com/talks/bruce_schneier/transcript) TED talk.\n- Are we more secure yet? (Especially looking us from out side. Can we give any guarantee that we are not 'group Mallory' trying to make people trust and use our software?)\n- Can we become more secure than (or at least as secure as) the official source? If yes, how?\n- etc.",

Introducing ZeroHDP - Our new hash database project.http://127.0.0.1:43110/17dtW9szkWFatjPhss8f5r8FVAfh3WEZ7x/\n\nNice!!! \nI think it still needs several improvements, but it is a good start. \nWe should turn this page as \"foolproof\" as we can... (We should make it at least difficult for users to turn this database (either deliberately or accidentally) into a mess.)  \n\nCan you turn the \"submit comment\" into a \"submit hash data\" requiring the user to provide only hash data in different well structured fields (timestamp, filename, source, hash)?\n\nIt would also be nice to have some guidelines in the headline explaining the aim and how to add new software to avoid duplicates or ambiguous collections.\n\nAlso instead of \"Add Hash\" it would be better to use \"Add New Software\" asking enough data (version, platform, 32bit/64bit) to make the file corresponding the software unique. So ideally in one thread we should expect to have the same unique hash collected by plenty of people. [Having two different hashes in one thread should mean that one of the sources is compromised (or that our guidelines were not foolproof enough).]",
