I'm thinking maybe a cron job that checks through the JSON files of ISRtalk and writes to a json file in zeroISR?  Gahh but that means I have to change the was zeroISR is made.  \nLong story short, I'm not sure. Totally open to suggestions.\n***\nAs for the shared key, I don't know how I feel about that. On one hand if we distributed and a single admin decided they where mad, they could destroy the entire site. On the other, if I am the only one able to access it, I could do the same thing (Not that I would of course, but I understand that you're all putting your trust in a complete stranger). Also, and far more likely, at some point I'm bound to get bored/busy with something else and stop working on this project. What do you all do then? I guess you could clone the site, but then the issue of getting people to move arises.  \nAgain, not sure. What do you all think?",

				"body": "I've said this before, but I can't find where so I guess here it goes.  \n***\nThe primary aim of ISR is that everyone everywhere will always be able to access important software for their day to day life. This means that if the videolan website dies forever, or for some reason is compromised (think hackers or censorship), there will always be at least one verified genuine installer for VLC on ISR.  \nThe secondary reason is more due to the hacker/censorship/NSA sort of thing. We hope (yes, just hope) that the software we all know and love is not compromised at the moment. We can support this hope by the fact the many people across the world are using the same file as us. The reason this makes us feel better is that if, say, the NSA built a backdoor into bitmessage, they likely wouldn't do that for servers outside the US. Instead, they would more likely just redirect US website visitors to their own page, complete with compromised download.  \nThis is why the file hashing is important. It tells us that we aren't being sent a fake file (or at least everyone is, but we hope that's less likely).  For all intents and purposes, going to the official site to download might still be a good idea if you are able. Then take that link and cross check the hash against our table.   \n***  \nAs for the target audience,  I'd say most people on zeronet. That is to say that people who have tech-backgrounds or maybe some concept of cybersecurity? Of course by no means do you need that to use our service, but much of our software centers around that.\n***\nSo to summarize, ISR is here to make sure everybody is able to get their hands on untampered important software.",

How about stating it on the Zite in a separate first paragraph formulated as:\"Our primary aim is to make important software accessible to everyone everywhere.\"?\nAgreed.\n> This is part is a bit confusing. For example, \"the website dies forever\" is quite an extreme case. So I'm not sure it is a good idea to use that for illustrating why our collection is useful. I think we should use more everyday situations here as government censorship and MitM/DDoS attacks. Also I'm not sure  VLC is the best example to be used in the illustration. I love VLC, but I'm not sure that is among the most endangered important software.  \n\nYeah' it's extreme. It's totally extreme. It also happened to TrueCrypt and limewire. \"Ah\" you say, \"but those both allowed and possibly encouraged illegal activity\". Well right you are. Isn't it a shame there aren't any other examples? Examples like Flappy Bird? Software disappears or changes all the time without notice. MySQL was used everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE before Oracle bought Sun Microsystems. Christ, now you can hardly get people to agree to talk about it.  \nSo yeah, VLC is hardly a security issue, and I also doubt it will die forever, but stranger things have happened. Perhaps you're right though. There's no reason for us to host it if we don't think it'll disappear. ***Can I get anybody else's thoughts on this?***  \n> The secondary reason also rises several questions: \n> \n> Isn't \"supporting hope\", \"makes us feel better\", etc. are misleading terms? Mallory and NSA want people \"to feel secure\". We should want them \"to be more secure\". See Bruce Schneier's The security mirage TED talk.  \n**Haha yeah. No idea how to solve this one. It's a biggie too.**\n> Are we more secure yet? (Especially looking us from out side. Can we give any guarantee that we are not 'group Mallory' trying to make people trust and use our software?)\n> Can we become more secure than (or at least as secure as) the official source? If yes, how?  \nPerhaps. That's probably the best answer I can give you. If we were able to talk to the devs of our software we could get encrypted and signed copies sent to us directly. This isn't super realistic, but it'll probably be doable for at least _some_ of the software. Anybody have any other ideas?",
