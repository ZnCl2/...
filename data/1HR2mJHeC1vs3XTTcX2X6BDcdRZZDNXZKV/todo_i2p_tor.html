<tr>
<td>I2P also benefits from academic research that Tor got</td>
<td>"<a href="https://geti2p.net/de/docs/how/threat-model">I2P design started in 2003, not long after the advent of [Onion Routing], [Freenet], and [Tor]. Our design benefits substantially from the research published around that time. I2P uses several onion routing techniques, so we continue to benefit from the significant academic interest in Tor.</a>"</td>

<tr>
<td>in I2P, since everyone is a node, the problems that Tor has, aren't there<br>
(In I2P, everyone is what could be called a "relay" in Tor)</td>
<td>"<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#BetterAnonymity">There are also some downsides to running a Tor relay. First, while we only have a few hundred relays, the fact that you're running one might signal to an attacker that you place a high value on your anonymity. Second, there are some more esoteric attacks that are not as well-understood or well-tested that involve making use of the knowledge that you're running a relay -- for example, an attacker may be able to "observe" whether you're sending traffic even if he can't actually watch your network, by relaying traffic through your Tor relay and noticing changes in traffic timing.</a>"</td>
<td>A002</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Tor can't use UDP, only TCP</td>
<td>
UDP has a lot of uses: e.g. most (A) of the P2P protocols use UDP as base<br>
So, it's harder to make Tor work with a P2P protocol<br>
(e.g. OpenBazaar, IPFS, Tox (they added a way to only use TCP, but it uses a relay, and so it isn't P2P anymore), Bittorrent (most trackers are now UDP, for efficienty) )
</td>
<td>A003</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>incentive</td>
<td>Tor: "<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EverybodyARelay">Fifth, we might need some sort of incentive scheme to encourage people to relay traffic for others, and/or to become exit nodes. Here are our current thoughts on Tor incentives.</a>"<br>
This, isn't a problem in I2P, as "you have more anonymity when giving more bandwidth"
</td>
<td>A004</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Tor uses outdated cryptography</td><td><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/HiddenServiceNames">If you decide to run a hidden service Tor generates an RSA-1024 keypair. The .onion name is computed as follows: first the SHA1 hash of the DER-encoded ASN.1 public key 
is calculated. Afterwards the first half of the hash is encoded to Base32 and the suffix ".onion" is added. Therefore .onion names can only contain the digits 2-7 and 
the letters a-z and are exactly 16 characters long.

(A) e.g. ZeroNet, doesn't use UDP.
(The only reason is: "Tor compatibility", and also because it doesn't have any DHT)
