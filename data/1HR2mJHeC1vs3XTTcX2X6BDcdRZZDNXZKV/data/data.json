Which makes it also easy for squatters to grab all domains :-( (2)\n\nAnyways, if you want also a .bit domain registered, \nfeel free to drop by in the [chat](/zeromedia.bit). (3)\n\n** **\n** **\n** **\nII. \n\nHere is some chat log, for general info:\n```\nuser: question: ive been roaming around the zeroname sites and most of them are just default pages like 0net://0badge.bit .... are these just what the devs put for future sites? so no one else takes them?\n\nme: it's not done by the devs. If you checked the link listed there, you will see I reserved those domains\n\nuser: what do you plan to do with all of those?\n\nme: First, use them for own projects (e.g. in the simplest form like ZeroBlogs, ZeroProxies and so on. Though, I have for some also other ideas).\nIn case I don't want to make a project for them, people can contact me and we can post in ZeroTalk a \"competition\":\na 2- week-period where people post what they would like to run there, who has the best idea AND who is a trusted/longtime member, ideally, will get it.\n\nuser: well... there is a difference between a long time user and an active user :P\n\nme: yeah, that's why I wrote also trusted\n\nuser: anyway, you better hold DEL.bit and list.DEL.bit for me :P\n\nme: I didn't register those, so you better register it\n\nuser: can't, got no namecoins\n\nme: ok, I have sent a request to namecoin. When you are ready, you can have it from me later\n```\n\n** **\n** **\n** **\n\nIII.\n_TODO:_\n_I will link here a few more tutorials which I have seen on other people's blogs which show how you can get a .bit domain yourself, or via a service provider._\n\n&nbsp; - [How to connect your .bit domain with your Zeronet site](/cryptonbits.bit/?Post:4:How+to+connect+your+.bit+domain+with+your+Zeronet+site)\n\n\n** **\n** **\n** **\nIV.\nToo long, didn't read\n\na.\nThis registering here is only for the lazy ones. It is always better to install the [namecoin](http://namecoin.info) client (4) yourself and register your desired .bit domain.\n\nb.\nYou don't need a .bit domain to access your site, people can access it fine over the (long) siteaddress. One disadvantage of .bit is that you have to renew it every 5-6 months. If you forget this, see remark (2) below.\n\n** **\n** **\n\n(1) exact costs are:\na) 0.010395 NMC for name_new\nb) 0.000627 NMC for first update\nc) There will also be costs for the domain transfer to my buddy. I will add the exact value later here.\nThe above values change a little due to the Namecoin network, but roughly it is like this. If you feel like giving more, I have nothing against that. I will use this for keeping the existing .bit domains in the future.\n\n(2) Keep in mind, squatters can get also very easily ALL currently registered domains and just wait until they expire, and grab them. The time period for expire is about 5-6 months. So, when you own the domain, DO NOT FORGET THIS. Because, squatters WILL grab it.\n\n(3) Don't make it too easy for the squatters, by posting your domain wish in below comments or into the chat without making sure I am around. Ideally, you ping me first in chat and then we talk and you send it to me via ZeroMail.\n\n(4) Careful, don't install the 0.3.x version, the [actual Namecoin client is 0.12.x](https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core). Somehow this 0.3 version is still around, but it can NOT communicate with the 0.12 version, which makes it slower for you, since you may not get \"enough\" peers for your transactions. I actually block all 0.3 clients in my client because it \"wastes\" my bandwidth.\n"

What are your thoughts about this topic ?\n\n** **\n** **\n_The text below is quoted with permission, and may contain text which is not available in the same <a href=\"/zeroblog.bit/?Post:13:licence+for+the+blog:+CC+BY-SA\">licence of the blog</a> - before reusing you've to clarify with me (e.g. basxto's contribution is under CC BY licence)._\n\n** **\n** **\n\n\n@ekaterina\nand there is no such license in place that forces people to make their ZeroNet sites or \"zites\" **open source** as far as I'm aware, but to me that line implies both of these things (not a native speaker though).\n\n@kaffie\nZites are open source by default. The entire source is fully readable and able to be copied and modified. Perhaps the copyright isn't that way, but the technology is. I'm not at all knowledgeable of the law, so if something's wrong here, feel free to correct it. AFAIK, 'open source' merely means you can see the code and compile/publish/etc content using it. Perhaps @nofish can chime in and explain what's up legally here.\n\n@ekaterina\nI'm not a 100% on these things either, but as far as I know: The term Open Source commonly refers to a specific type and set of licenses, that is actually regulated by a foundation, it doesn't mean merely that a site's code can be read. Every website has it's source available, that's just how websites work (right click, view page source), that doesn't mean the Google website or the Microsoft website for example is open source and can be freely shared and modified by everyone.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, of course it would be better if everything was open source and freely cloneable (where it makes sense), but open source is a niche, forcing it on people would hinder ZeroNet's mainstream adoption.\n\n@kaffie\nWell... not every site is open source. For example, you cannot view google's search code. It's **blackboxed** because of server-side stuff (php, python, perl, etc). This is part of what makes ZeroNet unique. There's no 'hidden code'. It's all out in the open for people to read/copy/etc.\n\nI've always used the term 'open source' in this manner (that you can read all of the code for something). But indeed, just because something is open source (that is, you can read the code) does not mean it's inherently licensed to be freely redistributed/modified.\n\nWhen I joined ZeroNet, I figured the 'clone able' option was more for ease of use: to default the data and make it easy for sites to be copied, rather than the long way around. Even the official [zeronet blog](/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:3:How+to+have+a+blog+like+this) explains how to copy a site without using the 'clone' button. This method works on any ZeroNet site.\n\n\n@ekaterina\nThat is true :) Although even ZeroNet sites can have **hidden server side code**. ZeroName, ZeroID, GIF Time, ZeroBoard all use Python or PHP server side code on a central node (these sites include the server side source code in the download though, so in these cases, while there is server side code, you can also read it, but that is optional, could be completely hidden from users).\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@kaffie\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But are they actually a part of the site? From what I can tell, they simply automate what the site owner would normally do. So while indeed those parts are hidden, they aren't really a part of the site. They're more like automated site owners. You can't, for instance, have a site use AJAX and pull information from a php script that then grabs from a database.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   @ekaterina\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   For some of these sites you are correct, ZeroBoard however actually sends posts through a PHP script on a normal web server. Only receiving the messages is decentralized through ZeroNet. It was the first ZeroNet site and apparently ZeroNet didn't support all the necessary features back then to really create a fully decentralized chat, which ZeroNet now can easily do.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     @basxto\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     That might explain why ZeroBoard does not work any longer for me, I only allow 127.0.0.1\n\n\n@basxto\n>Free software is software that comes with permission for anyone to use, copy, and/or distribute, either verbatim or with modifications, either gratis or for a fee.\n>The term “open source” software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software. It is not exactly the same class of software: they accept some licenses that we consider too restrictive, and there are free software licenses they have not accepted. However, the differences in extension of the category are small: nearly all free software is open source, and nearly all open source software is free.\n\n-> https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html\n\nIt does mean you can redistribute it, but the name itself does not imply that. It would be best for the network to release all zites as free / libre open source software though…\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @kaffie\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh. It'd be kind of silly to have a decentralized web where you're not allowed to copy things.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  @erkan\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yeah, if you make ZeroNet apps/sites, one should be (mentally) ready that they are copied. It's for the community.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  @basxto\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Most people just don't give a shit or don't know better. Even though it does need such little effort to make perfectly legal. (same as using creative commons licenses on ZeroBlogs and on ZeroWiki)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    @erkan\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    CC: yeah, not giving a licence FORCES people to ask, because it's then under normal copyright. By giving a licence one explicitly helps people reusing it faster\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     @basxto\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     and most people would probably be annoyed if they got asked because of every littleness\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     @ekaterina\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     On the other hand, one also shouldn't force people to add an open source license if they don't want that for whatever reason. Free Software is a political ideology that most people and especially companies don't share. It's the MIT/BSD/Apache Vs GPL debate. Allow people the freedom to decide for themselves (MIT/BSD/Apache), or force everyone to make everything freely available (GPL).\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t@erkan\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t@ekaterina of course, people must decide themselves. What I or others say is our opinion (only)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t @ekaterina\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t Of course, I was just speaking in general terms , didn't mean you or anyone here directly, I just generally prefer freedom over excluding people for political reasons. If ZeroNet is to actually replace the internet / become a serious alternative, it must also be a place for companies for example, even if some people don't like companies, and that also means closed source in most cases.\n"

Probably set individual limits for \"trusted\" users.\n\nAnyway, the fix for the French chat would be to make a change in the following file:\n&nbsp; _data/myhash/data/users/content.json_\nand to sign it, see [here](/zeroblog.bit/?Post:34:you+have+to+tell+siteSign+what+to+sign,+specifically).\n\n\n** **\n(just quoting now the general limit below:)\n** **\n`    \"permission_rules\": {`\n`      \".*\": {`\n`        \"files_allowed\": \"data.json\", `\n`        \"max_size\": 10000`\n`      }, `\n \n** **\n** **\n(0) deleting all the directories, as suggested, would also remove the history of the other chat users.\n(1) stupid: because it happens to me. Users always perceive bugs happening to them as very important. Egoists, we are. Anyways the limit is good to protect the chat from spammers (see more in the text)\n(2) http://127.0.0.1:43110/1CjR14fofbRJ54oj8A7rAfWpzpLawdP5uc"
