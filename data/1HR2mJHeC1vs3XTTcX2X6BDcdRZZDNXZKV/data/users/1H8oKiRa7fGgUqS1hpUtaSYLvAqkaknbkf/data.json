Someone [asked](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/twister-users/vLpb244c_FE\n) Miguel once why he didn't choose e.g. namecoin. Miguel said, back then he didn't know of namecoin. Also, there was once a discussion on the google group to use Merkle trees for twister, but nothing concrete programmed yet for that\n\n4) twister's Android client is just proof of concept: I have had many people say also, it doesn't work. Miguel also wrote on [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/twister-users/G0zm_6_zg5k) as a roadmap to make (a better) one. Not saying that the GNUroot solution for ZN is better ;-)\n\n8) of course it does: it is not only microblogging. you have a forum, own pages, ... any kind of app you can program in JS/coffeescript\n\n9) I wonder how you measured that? Probably you mean some parts of the reused code (from bitcoin)?\n\n> all new projects to help againt and avoid the control of the NSA & Co. are wellcome.\n\nThe only thing in twister doing that is the private messaging (called DMs, which was impl. from Lavabit example code). Everything else is in public. So, archived by NSA and other authorities. The only good thing is that they at least do not see where we click, when we read it.\nIn ZN there are more apps offering [encryption](/zeroencryption.bit) than just mail",
