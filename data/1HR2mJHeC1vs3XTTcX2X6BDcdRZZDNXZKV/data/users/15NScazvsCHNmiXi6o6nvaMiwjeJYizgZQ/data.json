The person who also commented was @kaffie\n> @musickiller yeah it was a long night. It's not better than zeroid, it's just a clone. I added in the why?-section above why I made it. Someone also said: \"id for irl friends, id for university, id for internet chan\". As long as people don't misuse this for spam and such: it's ok.\n\nthen it only makes sence to use a single auth system, with different names for friends, uni, chan etc. I have nothing against a name like uni.mk, chan.mk, etc. But I won't like if someone will write with my name. Bad news - it IS going to happen sooner or later.\n\nSo may be SITES should notify if id manager is different? Like when someone is writing from \"sk@wrong.bit\", Mail would tell me \"attention! this ID is not present on your \"known\" list!\" or \"this id's verification service is not ZeroID!\"\n\nI think it smells of monopolization, but still a good option. One still may ignore it and use whatever he likes (in case his name was taken on other ID server for example), but the majority (wich may be not as geeky of current majority) will stay safe.\n\nWhat'chu think?",
