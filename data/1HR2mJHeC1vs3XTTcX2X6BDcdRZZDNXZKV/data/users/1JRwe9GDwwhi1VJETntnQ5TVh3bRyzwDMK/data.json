You fully trust the proxy owner with all your data. You cannot even be sure it is a real ZeroNet proxy you are connecting to. (And of course, it is totally against the ZeroNet's idea of decentralization.) \n\nI believe there is no other sane way than running ZeroNet yourself (probably using Tor). ",
