I'm not aware about the license for ZeroBlog, but ZeroNet itself is distributed under GPLv2+, so let's assume ZeroBlog uses the same license – just for the sake of the argument. Putting `{\"license\": \"GPL\"}` in content.json in ambiguous at best because nobody knows whether the license covers the software or the contents. And just because the software is GPL'ed, it doesn't follow that the contents should also be GPL'ed.\n\nI believe it pays to be explicit in these matters, and I like the way you handled it. 👍",

Personally, and for the reasons @razzo mentioned, I would only use a proxy if it were my own and the connection were secure, but that's a matter of preference.\n\nFor me, a proxy can be handy if I want to refer to a page on Zeronet, but other than that I don't by the premise that we “need” [more] proxies.",
