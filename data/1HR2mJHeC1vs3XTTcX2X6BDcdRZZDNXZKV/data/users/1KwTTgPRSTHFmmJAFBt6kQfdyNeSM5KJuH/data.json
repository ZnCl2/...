From what I understand: message are routed to as many addresses as possible, and each tries to decrypt every message it receives. If a message can't be decrypted, it must be meant for another user--so it's distributed to more nodes.\n\nIt's a really neat idea, though I do wonder if there are other ways of concealing metadata.",

			"body": "There's a reverse side to this too: On the clearnet, undesired content will continue to be available regardless of how may people want it removed. People who want it removed can report it, or DDoS the site--but there's no guarantee about how the first will go (Encyclopedia Dramatica, anyone?), and the second is illegal in most of the world.\nUsers in ZN, however, can refuse to seed unwanted content, reducing the zite to a single server (as if it were a clearnet site). It's a perfectly valid method of curbing unwanted content by 'voting with your bandwidth' (and HDD space).\nThis means that the only problem here is that ZN cannot prevent people from hosting said content in the first place--but then again, democracies are meant to give _everyone_ a share, even terrible people. Oh, and clearnets have the same hosting problem for the most part.\n/rant",
