			"body": "Very interesting comparison!\n\nI used to use BitMessage a lot before (my address is still published in my blog), but after the launching of ZeroMail, my usage declined, mostly due to item (0). I still think that there are a few little advantages to using bitmessage, such as the ability to transpose them into email via \"gateways\" like https://bitmessage.ch\n\nWith all that said, though, I barely ever open the BitMessage App anymore. ZeroNet with ZeroMail has become a self-sustained platform for blogging, social networking, chatting and personal communications. :D",

			"body": "It's nice that you have created a new alternative to ZeroID, further decentralizing the possibilities of authentication in ZeroNet. I'd love to see ZeroVerse expand!\n\nHow did you do it, though? Did you clone the ZeroID site or coded it from scratch?\n\n> [ks](#comment_10_14TDWFVHuTXNcg8pp6LRr7v9ZcfbFsMSyx): IMHO, IDs shouldn't be tied to a specific provider. The more providers, the merrier. However, content providers — bloggers, moderators, … — should, of course, be allowed to chose which ID providers they accept.\n\nThis is a nice idea. If ZeroNet itself is by nature decentralized, so should be the methods used for authentication. However, I believe that we should take this one step further: if providers and users could choose between methods of authentication, why not choose to not authenticate at all? The funny thing is: we can already do this for hosting our own Zites, but when it comes to commenting on a forum or another Zite, suddenly everybody has to authenticate! Where's the anonymity now?\n\nI like pseudonymity, but anonymity is better, especially if the platform already offers the possibility.",

			"body": "> [ks](#comment_11_14TDWFVHuTXNcg8pp6LRr7v9ZcfbFsMSyx): I guess the only excuse I can find is that it allows for fewer duplicate usernames in e.g. a chat.\n\nWell, if no one has usernames, there is no possibility of collision :) Also, changing profiles here isn't as easy as IRC. To change your \"nick\" here, you'd have to run the whole nine yards from shutting down zeronet, changing `users.json`, re-authenticating in zero[ID|verse] and signing into the Zite again.\n\n> Having to register also serves a rate-limiting purpose, but that would be better handled by hashcash (the site ‘owner’ could require e.g. minimum a 20 bit collision for posting).\n\nYup, hashcash! Hadn't thought about it. Thanks for pointing out!",

Erkan, you have pretty much nailed the point: freedom of speech here means that the platform will not prevent you from posting whatever it is that you wanna post, be it porn, piracy, how to make chocolate chip cookies or a picture of your favorite underwear. *However*, this doesn't mean that people are forced to see what you post. They can simply not host or read your content at all if they dislike.",
