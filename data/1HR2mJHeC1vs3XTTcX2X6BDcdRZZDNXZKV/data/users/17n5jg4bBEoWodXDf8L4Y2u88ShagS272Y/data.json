So they are helping us by doing less! There have been studies that show the FDA kills more people than it saves, by having a strict process for drugs that can save lives, but also in that they increase the cost of research which makes the drugs more expensive.",

Unless that is, ZeroNet only sends a diff/patch of the changed data.json file.\n\nI feel like this may need a new feature in ZeroNet, allow users to demonstrate presence on a Zite if they want.\n",
