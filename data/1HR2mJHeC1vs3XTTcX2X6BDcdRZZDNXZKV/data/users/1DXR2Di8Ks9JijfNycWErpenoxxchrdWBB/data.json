Twister & ZN have a lot of JS, BUT twister works on my Firefox and ZN doesnt work with deactivated JS.\n\nZN heavily depends on JS for dynamic content. There does not seem to be a good solution when we need to keep the decentralization.",

In clearnet JS only contacts the corresponding backend, where the querying of data is done. But in ZeroNet all that is done by JS. I can't imagine how would it be possible to write such a transpiler.",
