YODA'S EXTRACTION METHOD

RWB
RE: Yoda's extraction method

Just started doing it (Yoda's method) to my Phalaris extract obtained from JLF. Added 2X volumes of straight muriatic acid (mine was 8% HCl) to the extract and shook the f*ck out of it. THEN I suddenly remembered his instructions said to adjust the pH of the acid to "1" first (before adding) and I did not do this. "Jesus Christ!" I says to myself, "You screwed up on the first step, you dumbshit!"

So I tested the pH of the acidified extract, and it looks to be "0" (not 1). That was kinda hard to tell for sure since I'm using 0-14 range paper (difficult to tell because of the subtle color changes on the comparison chart. Now I'm wondering if this is gonna screw up the end product... (will the DMT/5-meo decompose if the pH was too low?).

Question #2: is it really necessary to steep the extract in HCl for a full
week? Wouldn't excessive, prolonged, and repeated shaking (over several days) give the same results as a week's worth of steeping (with only occasional, wimp-ass shaking)?

Many thanks for your input...

RE: Yoda's extraction method

Hey RWB...knew you'd make it over here eventually. Sorry to say, it's not yet a place to come for answers. I can help you with one of your questions though. You shouldn't need to soak the extract for the kind of time needed to extract from raw plant material. My guess is that with some agitation the gunk should dissolve in the HCL fairly quickly. Once everything is dissolved that's gonna dissolve, that's it. As for the PH question-- I don't know. My guess it that super extreme PH will destroy alkaloids, but I think I've heard this is true more for high rather than low phs...still, I'm no chemist...Don't bother with the 5-meo natural gunk though. Buy some pure. If you want N, N you should go with the mimosa...

By the way, why do you censor "fuck"?


RWB
RE: Yoda's extraction method

Thanks for the response. Yeah, because of the screw-up, I'm not expecting to get anything usable this time (will finish it all up and find out for sure tonight, though). When I originally bought the extract, I thought it contained straight DMT. After ordering, I discovered/read that it probably contained 5-meo as well, and this would likely overpower any DMT present. Live and learn. Now I'm looking for a place to get Mimosa from, and will be trying that extraction next... Will post results here, of course.

Oh, my reason for using "f*ck"? I wanted some answers, and didn't want to offend anybody who might be able to help me... I promise I won't do it again. Is that a-fucking-okay with you? ;^)

Thanks again.

RE: Yoda's extraction method

I don't know...."f*ck" always seemed dirtier to me than "fuck"...Yeah, AFAIA all the phalarises have too high a ration of 5MEO to N,N for the effect of N, N to be felt. Mimosa is supposed to be the ticket, and the best is supposed to be sold by:

Botanical Preservation Corps
Box 1368
Sebastopol, CA, 95173

Catalog $2.

Mimosa hostilis root bark is $15/oz. Shipping up to $15: $5, $16-50: $8. They don't have a web site, email, or even a phone number unfortunately. Reputed to be very reliable. The catalog is fascinating. This company is one half of "Of the Jungle". The other half is "Allies", and they carry the live plants while BPC has the roots, barks, and berrys...


Nicodemus
RE: Yoda's extraction method

I'm sure you know that JLF sells Mimosa hostilis roots, but if you find a source that sells for less let me know because I'm looking too. I have heard that the roots JLF sell contain no DMT but this makes no sense because I've checked sources and they all says Mimosa hostilis roots are the DMT source.


Skeptic
RE: Yoda's extraction method

Reportedly, JLF is selling mimosa BARK...not root bark. I don't have the catalog in front of me, but I don't think they even claim it as root bark. The trunk and branch bark DOES contain DMT, but it is negligible compared to the up to 1% N,N DMT contained in the root bark.


Nicodemus
RE: Yoda's extraction method

They claim it as "Roots." If Mimosa hostilis is like D. illinoensis then the root bark comprises half the mass of the entire root, which would make JLF's $13 for 60 grams better than $15 for an oz. I'm not sure about this though, if anybody has ordered this please tell me about it.


Skeptic
RE: Yoda's extraction method

I don't know...but I can tell you that JLF's mimosa (whatever it might be) got lousy reviews on the ayahuasca list. BPC's has gotten excellent reviews everywhere. For the record, I don't have any relationship with BPC and I've never tried anybody's mimosa....(holding out for orange wax...)


lux
RE: Yoda's extraction method

Does that "oficially" make Mimosa Hostilis root bark the most potent source know (or available)?

P.S. Hey Skeptic, how do YOU intend to get what you're "... holding out for"?;-))

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

OK, here is my revised, reworded and simplified version of Yoda's method. Take a look and tell me where it is confusing or unclear, where it could be further simplified, or if I left anything out.

===================Extracting DMT from plant material----
Things to know before you begin:

   1. The acids, bases and solvents used in this extraction can be dangerous. Wear gloves and eye protection at all times when adding chemicals together

   2. Make sure all of your equipment is clean before you use it by running it through a properly working dishwasher.3. Test all your equipment to make sure that the acids, bases or solvents they will be exposed to during this procedure cannot damage or dissolve them.

Materials and equipment needed:
Muratic acid from a hardware store
Lye from a supermarket (Red Devil brand is good) Naptha (from a hardware store or zippo lighter fluid) Distilled water (only use this, never tap water) Ph meter or Ph tester papers (a meter is better) A few glass jars with lids, one of which is tall 
A turkey baster
Some coffee filters
A tea strainer
A glass baking dish
Plant material containing DMT

Extraction procedure:

   1. Fill a jar halfway with water and SLOWLY add acid to the water until it is at Ph 1.

   2. Pulverize the plant material and add it to the jar with the acid.

   3. Tightly cap the jar and shake it several times a day for one week.

   4. Strain off the liquid into another jar through the tea strainer.

   5. Filter the liquid through a couple of the coffee filters into another jar. Cap and save this jar.

   6. Make up another jar of acid as in step 1 and add the strained plant material to the jar.

   7. Tightly cap the jar and shake a few times a day for 1-2 days.

   8. Strain and filter the jar's contents as in steps 4 and 5, and add the filtered liquid to the liquid obtained from step 5.

   9. Fill the tall jar 1/3 full of the liquid and add an equal amount of naptha.

  10. Cap the tall jar and shake vigorously, opening the cap occasionally to vent any pressure. Let the jar sit for a few minuted between shakings. Repeat this step for a couple of hours and then let the jar sit for a while.

  11. The liquid inside the jar should have separated into two or three layers. Draw off the top layer with the turkey baster and throw it away.

  12. Slowly add 1/8 teaspoon of lye crystals to the solution, stirring gently. Check Ph after each addition of lye. Continue adding lye until you reach Ph 11-12. The jar will probably heat up during this step, so let it cool to room temperature before continuing.

  13. Fill the tall jar 1/3 full of the solution and add an equal amount of naptha.

  14. Cap the tall jar and shake vigorously, opening the cap occasionally to vent any pressure. Let the jar sit for a few minuted between shakings. Repeat this step for a couple of hours and then let the jar sit for a while.

  15. The liquid inside the jar should have separated into two or three layers. If there are three layers, let the jar sit a while longer (overnight if necessary) to let the layers separate some more. If the middle layer still will not go away, try adding more naptha and/or some salty water and shaking again.16. Draw off the top layer with the turkey baster and store it in another jar.

  17. Add more naptha to the first jar and repeat steps 13-15, adding the top layer from this step to the jar containing the first top layer.

  18. Pour the combined top layers into the glass dish and let the solvent liquid evaporate. Crystals will form on the dish as it does so. These crystals are your DMT freebase. Complete evaporation may take several days.

Revised DMT extraction method

Some notes and questions on the new procedure:

    * I added the use of distilled water. It is quite cheap and eliminates tapwater as a possible contaminant source.* I also added the note about washing your equipment before use. Again, an easy way to eliminate contamination.

    * The naptha layer does come out on top, right?

    * Just how necessary is that initial defatting step, anyway? Anyone tried skipping it?

    * Has anyone needed anything more than time to break up the emulsion layer?

    * Should I specify Mimosa rootbark as the plant material? If that is the way to go, maybe I should orient the document around it. After all, there are several documents oriented around Phalaris.

    * Is it really necessary to do the acid extraction for a whole damn WEEK? That seems a bit excessive to me, especially considering that we are using Ph 1 here. Maybe I should try to work in some heating during the acid extraction - that should speed things up quite a bit. We'll see.

    * Should I skip the hardware store naptha bit and just say to go get zippo fluid? I think everyone should be able to get zippo fluid in any supermarket or 7-11, and the hardware store naptha is much more likely to be contaminated.* I am a bit concerned about the adding of pure lye crystals to a Ph 1 solution. Aside from the violently exothermic possibilities (spattering, localized overheating, fuming), the lye might temporarily spike the local Ph to 14+. That will almost certainly destroy the alkaloids in the vicinity of the spike, thus lowering yields to some degree. A better (and safer) way would be to make up a solution of lye-water and add this with stirring, one teaspoonful at a time. That is what I always did. That's it for now. I need people who have used Yoda's method on Mimosa or have seen it done to come forward with their comments. If anyone could try following these steps blindly to see if they work like they should, that would be even better.

Let's work together to get this process nailed down tight and eliminate every single unknown.

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

Dosadi, looks like a great bargain-basement method! You might add some notes on how to make the whole operation "fancier". Like, use either DI rootbark or M. hostilis as plant material. Use pure sodium/potassium hydroxide. Red Devil will give you far more contaminents that tapwater will...

DCM is a better non-polar solvent. Ozark Trail brand (Walmart) camp fuel (naptha) seems to be pretty clean. Use a stirrer when mixing is required. Hook two insulated wires up to a 9v battery, and stick one wire into each layer to assist in breaking emulsion. WARNING: DO NOT let it spark, for obvious reasons. Something like that. Also, is ammonium hydroxide ok to use? Will the ammonia do anything to the alkaloids?

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

Dosadi-I would definitely consider the defatting step optional, especially with mimosa. It's really more hassle than it's worth, as well as a waste of solvent. Though it's not cheap, a sep. funnel is HIGHLY recommended. Breaking emulsions: poking with a wire and more solvent and time are usually all that are needed, especially with DCM (which I realize is a little harder to come by)

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

Great guys, and I'll play (am?) the "joe-average" beginner here and just tell you where questions arrise for me in simply reading through and visualizing the process. When you all feel we've nailed it down, then I'll actually run through it word for word in the "real world". So, feedback Brother-D:

Regarding numbers...

   1. What size/type jar (ball canning jar?, pyrex?, 1/2 gallon, gallon, what?) AND how much organic material. I'm sure you wanted to leave this open but, there no use in sending folks into this process with less than will yield a productive result or more than is handlable - right?!

   2. Material wet or dry? Pulverize how (freezing, grinding, blending)?

   8. Why don't you introduce a convention of reference called "rounds" to simplify the numerous times this process seems to double back on itself?

   9. Let's get a clearer name for "the liquid". It gets transformed (rests, gets added to, etc.) at each stage but must be referred to distictly before it get manipulated in each new step.11. Any additional discriptor here other than just "the top layer" that would help? (i.e. gunky, poamy, thick).

  12. "...1/8th tspn..." and then add "...at a time..."13 again, just as in #9 above, can you find some acceptable name for "the solution" because you've now got "the liquids" mixed with "the solution" but, some are discarded and some are combined, and some are.... (you get the point). Try wording like: "Let's call this solution #1", etc.

  15. how salty?(and why a "and/or" option here and how would the neophyte decide?).

  17. "...first jar..." is again confusing. Again, I'd rather read: "Let's call this Jar #1. We will be comming back to jar number one in a few steps", etc. Well, just some ideas at first read. I'm certain those of you who are chem-conversant must often just roll your eyes at this kind of nit-picky detail but, I assure you the "masses" will be so greatful.

***********Extracting DMT from Mimosa Hostilis
***********By Dosadi Based on Yoda's DMT extraction method

========Foreword and disclaimer:

This document describes a simple, straightforward procedure for the extraction of the drug DMT from the root bark of the plant Mimosa Hostilis. This procedure will work if you follow it exactly - you should end up with crystals of DMT freebase that are pure enough to smoke. Any deviation from the instructions or use of alternate chemicals or a different type of plant matarial are not guaranteed to produce the desired results. If this procedure does not work correctly for you and you are positive that you have followed it exactly, post your experience to DMT World and we will try to determine where the problem lies. This procedure is a specialized example of a more general type of extraction procedure known as a double-layer acid-base extraction. If you are interested in the theory behind these extractions, wish to adapt the process described in this document for use with another type of plant material besides Mimosa Hostilis root bark, or are interested in exploring modifications to this procedure such as the use of alternate types of chemicals or equipment, you are encouraged to read the documentation at DMT World which discuss the more general topic of double-layer acid-base extractions in detail.

This document is devoted to extraction of DMT, not DMT itself. It is assumed that you already know what DMT is, what its effects are, what its health risks are and how to use it safely and effectively. If you do not know one or more of these things, please look at the documentation at DMT World which discusses the properties of DMT before continuing with this extraction procedure. The author of this document assumes no liability for anything that may happen to you as a result of carrying out any of the procedures described in this document.

----Things to know before you begin:

1. The chemicals used in this extraction can be dangerous. Wear gloves and eye protection at all times when adding chemicals together. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Work in a clean, safe environment with adequate ventilation and lighting.

2. Make sure all of your equipment is clean before you use it by running it through a properly working dishwasher. Clean equipment works better in general.

3. Before starting this procedure, test all your equipment to make sure that the chemicals they will be exposed to during this procedure will not damage or dissolve them.

4. Read the whole procedure carefully before you begin, so you can plan out and schedule the time you will need. Do not attempt to rush through any of the steps - if at any point in the process you are interrupted and need to stop, you can cap your jars and store them (see the next note) until you have the time to continue.

5. At several points in the procedure, you will need to store a jar or jars for a period of time. Make sure to cap the jar(s) tightly, clean their outsides thoroughly to avoid chemical stains, and store them in a clean, dry place at room temperature.

6. Distilled water is listed as one of the materials needed below. Be sure to use it and NOT plain tapwater whenever water is called for in the procedure. Tapwater often contains chemicals and/or dissolved minerals that may cause problems. Don't take the chance.

7. The glass jars which are used in this procedure are numbered 1 though 8 to aid in identification. Not all the jars are needed at the same time, so it is not actually necessary to obtain 8 jars. When a jar is not needed any more, it may be "recycled" by cleaning it in a dishwasher and then it may be reused later in the procedure as new jars are needed. The procedure will tell you when a jar can be recycled. You can get away with using only two jars, but if you do this you will need to wash the recycled jar right away ater each step in order to have it available for use in the next step. More jars will allow you to defer washing the recycled jars until you have run out of clean ones. If you decide to use 8 jars, you will not have to wash any of the recycled jars until the whole procedure is finished.

8. The quantity of DMT you will get out of this procedure (assuming you don't make any mistakes) is determined by the quantity of root bark you begin with. Mimosa Hostilis root bark contains around 1% DMT by weight, but you will probably not be able to extract 100% of the DMT out. An average smoked dose is 60 milligrams, so assume that you will need to put in at least 6 grams of root bark in order to get out at least one smokeable dose of DMT. Given how long this procedure takes to run through and that yields are rarely 100%, it makes sense to extract as much root bark as you can (within reason, of course). 25 grams is a good amount to start with.

9. The more you pulverize your root bark, the better your yields from this procedure will be. Powder is ideal.

Materials and equipment needed:

Muratic acid from a hardware store
Lye from a supermarket (Red Devil brand is good) Naptha (from zippo lighter fluid, Rossinol brand is good) Several gallons of distilled water
Ph meter or Ph tester papers (a meter is better) A few glass mason jars with lids (see note 7 above) A turkey baster
Some coffee filters
A tea strainer
A glass baking dish
Mimosa Hostilis root bark

Extraction procedure:

   1. Fill a jar 1 halfway with water and SLOWLY add acid to the water until it is at Ph 1.

   2. Add the pulverized root bark to jar 1.

   3. Tightly cap jar 1 and shake it several times a day for one week.

   4. Strain the liquid from jar 1 into jar 2 through the tea strainer. Recycle jar 1.

   5. Filter the liquid from jar 2 through the coffee filters into jar 3. Cap and save jar 3 and recycle jar 2.

   6. Make up another jar of acid as in step 1. This is jar 4.

   7. Add the strained plant material to jar 4.

   8. Tightly cap jar 4 and shake a few times a day for 1-2 days.

   9. Strain the liquid from jar 4 into jar 5 through the tea strainer. Recycle jar 4.

  10. Filter the liquid from jar 5 through the coffee filters into jar 6. Recycle jar 5.

  11. Add the contents of jar 6 to jar 3. Recycle jar 6.

  12. Slowly add 1/8 teaspoon of lye crystals to the solution in jar 3, stirring gently until all the lye has dissolved. Check the Ph of the solution. Continue adding lye, stirring and checking Ph in this manner until the Ph reaches 11. The jar will probably heat up during this step, so after you have reached Ph 11 you should let it cool to room temperature before continuing.

  13. Fill the tall jar 1/3 full of the solution and add an equal amount of naptha.

  14. Cap the tall jar and shake vigorously, opening the cap occasionally to vent any pressure. Let the jar sit for a few minuted between shakings. Repeat this step for a couple of hours and then let the jar sit for a while.

  15. The liquid inside the jar should have separated into two or three layers. If there are three layers, let the jar sit a while longer (overnight if necessary) to let the layers separate some more. If the middle layer still will not go away, try adding more naptha and/or some salty water and shaking again.16. Draw off the top layer with the turkey baster and store it in another jar.

  17. Add more naptha to the first jar and repeat steps 13-15, adding the top layer from this step to the jar containing the first top layer.

  18. Pour the combined top layers into the glass dish and let the solvent liquid evaporate. Crystals will form on the dish as it does so. These crystals are your DMT freebase. Complete evaporation may take several days.

When a jar is not needed any more, it may be "recycled" by cleaning it in a dishwasher and then it may be reused later in the procedure as new jars are needed. The procedure will tell you when a jar can be recycled. You can get away with using only two jars, but if you do this you will need to wash the recycled jar right away ater each step in order to have it available for use in the next step. More jars will allow you to defer washing the recycled jars until you have run out of clean ones. If you decide to use 8 jars, you will not have to wash any of the recycled jars until the whole procedure is finished.

8. The quantity of DMT you will get out of this procedure (assuming you don't make any mistakes) is determined by the quantity of root bark you begin with. Mimosa Hostilis root bark contains around 1% DMT by weight, but you will probably not be able to extract 100% of the DMT out. An average smoked dose is 60 milligrams, so assume that you will need to put in at least 6 grams of root bark in order to get out at least one smokeable dose of DMT. Given how long this procedure takes to run through and that yields are rarely 100%, it makes sense to extract as much root bark as you can (within reason, of course). 25 grams is a good amount to start with.

9. The more you pulverize your root bark, the better your yields from this procedure will be. Powder is ideal.

Materials and equipment needed:

Muratic acid from a hardware store
Lye from a supermarket (Red Devil brand is good) Naptha (from zippo lighter fluid, Rossinol brand is good) Several gallons of distilled water
Ph meter or Ph tester papers (a meter is better) A few glass mason jars with lids (see note 7 above) A turkey baster
Some coffee filters
A tea strainer
A glass baking dish
Mimosa Hostilis root bark

Extraction procedure:

   1. Fill a jar 1 halfway with water and SLOWLY add acid to the water until it is at Ph 1.

   2. Add the pulverized root bark to jar 1.

   3. Tightly cap jar 1 and shake it several times a day for one week.

   4. Strain the liquid from jar 1 into jar 2 through the tea strainer. Recycle jar 1.

   5. Filter the liquid from jar 2 through the coffee filters into jar 3. Cap and save jar 3 and recycle jar 2.

   6. Make up another jar of acid as in step 1. This is jar 4.

   7. Add the strained plant material to jar 4.

   8. Tightly cap jar 4 and shake a few times a day for 1-2 days.

   9. Strain the liquid from jar 4 into jar 5 through the tea strainer. Recycle jar 4.

  10. Filter the liquid from jar 5 through the coffee filters into jar 6. Recycle jar 5.

  11. Add the contents of jar 6 to jar 3. Recycle jar 6.

  12. Slowly add 1/8 teaspoon of lye crystals to the solution in jar 3, stirring gently until all the lye has dissolved. Check the Ph of the solution. Continue adding lye, stirring and checking Ph in this manner until the Ph reaches 11. The jar will probably heat up during this step, so after you have reached Ph 11 you should let it cool to room temperature before continuing.

  13. Fill jar 7 1/3 full of the solution in jar 3 and add an equal amount of naptha.

  14. Cap jar 7 and shake vigorously, opening the cap occasionally to vent any pressure. Let the jar sit for a few minutes between shakings. Repeat this step for a couple of hours and then let the jar sit for a while.

  15. The liquid inside jar 7 should have separated into two or three layers. If there are three layers, let the jar sit a while longer (overnight if necessary) to give the layers time to separate some more. If the middle layer still will not go away, try adding more naptha and repeating step 15 again. Stirring a CLEAN wire around in the middle layer can also help break it up.

  16. Draw off as much of the top layer in jar 7 with the turkey baster as you can without drawing off any of the middle or bottom layers and store it in jar 8.

  17. Add more naptha to jar 7 and repeat steps 14-16. Recycle jar 7

  18. Pour the contents of jar 8 into the glass dish and let the liquid evaporate. Crystals will form on the dish as it does so. These crystals are your DMT freebase. Recycle jar 8.

  19. If jar 3 still has any liquid in it, repeat steps 13-18 until you have processed all of the liquid in jar 3. Recycle jar 3.

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

OK, here are some notes on the new version of the extraction procedure. Overall, I have decided to give up on small size and concentrate on reducing ambiguity and increasing detail. To this end, I added a bunch more "before you begin" notes and implemented Lux's idea of labeling the jars. I hope the numeric jar labeling and "recycling" scheme isn't too hard to follow. I also specified the nature and quantity of the equipment and chemicals more clearly.

Finally, I decided to orient the whole document around Mimosa. Once again, read it over and tell me what you think.I left the issues of lye crystals vs. lye-water and the week-long acid extraction as they were since no one has said anything about them. They may be tweakable, but until I hear from someone who has tried messing with them or I get a chance to play with this stuff myself, I am not going to modify a method which works unless I can test the modifications.

Should I list suppliers of Mimosa in the document itself? Whenever this has been done in the past, the supplier info has become outdated and useless over the course of years. Maybe I should just say that the document assumes that you already have some Mimosa and provide some pointers to net-based lists of companies?

As soon as this document is satisfactory to y'all (and preferably after someone has used it successfully), I will HTML-ize it with tables and colors and whatnot and ask Wolfsblood to post it up with the rest of the reference materials.

    Does substituting DCM for Naptha make any difference in the process, maybe you could list a variety of "available" options that work under one method? There has been some talk about the lack of "understanding" of the process and how this takes away a certain level of comprehension and legitamicy to extracting your own DMT (if you can't understand it you shouldn't do it...a dumb arguement when considering people learn things by doing the process themselves even if they don't understand it initially....no matter how much you read about driving a car, you won't be able to drive or even understand driving until you try it yourself). At the end of the "recipe" you could always add a step-by-step explantation of what IS chemically happening throughout the recipe as well as a warning/description of what is occurring....I have learned a lot by the countless hours of research i have done on the net and I really appreciate your summing up a sound procedure in such a comprehensiable manner, thank you....however it needs to be tested before dissemination....I sent a check out to Botanical Preservation Corps today.

You are completely missing my point! I'm saying if you can't understand it,you WON'T BE ABLE TO DO IT!

No matter how good your instructions are, this is not as simple as baking a cake from a box of cakemix. Have you ever brewed beer? It's a very simple idea, yet takes a fair amount of learning and practice to be able to pull it off(well).

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

There is something to be said for requiring people to put some thought and effort into something like this. If producing smokable DMT involves something more involved than mixing this brand of pancake batter with that brand of hair gel, the likelihood is that those who successfully complete the process will be better prepared for the resulting experience. The mindless task provides no time for relection. To further add to Bacchus' excellent points, we shouldn't forget that it is possible to hurt or even kill oneself with this process if one doesn't know what one is doing. There are multiple opportunities for disaster inherent in the extraction.

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

Smokey, while I see the merit of thinking one kind of has to prove they are ready for the experience, I myself am not comfortable telling people that. That's just me. I'd rather just put the info out there and let people do with it what they may. On the other hand, I am somewhat concerned about people's PHYSICAL safety, but I get weary of disclaimers after a while too. The way I see it, the bottom line is ,this is hard enough to do, and the goal (DMT freebase) obscure enough, that the whole idea is somewhat self-limiting I don't exactly lie awake worrying that some kid is going to blow their mind on it just cause I posted some pointers on the internet.

Dosadi,
Thanks so much for your efforts in Round 2. I found several of the changes very clarifying. This feels to be a point at which I will depart, your/our revised method in hand, and head into the "real" world of trial and error. Thanks for your attention to detail and your service to all who would/must recreate this process to aquire/consume/experience this acclaimed soma.

Others,
Post as you see this forum best used but, please consider starting whole new threads when getting into other related issues (i.e. pros-n-cons of free access to information and plant sources, etc.). They are all obviously valid areas of consideration but, IMHO often cloud the purpose of a thread like this with a very specific title and intent.

    When discusing Dosadi's revamping of Yoda's method you say:"Hook two insulated wires up to a 9v battery, and stick one wire into each layer to assist in breaking emulsion." What is the purpose (reasons, results) in doing this step.... specific details would be helpful, my chemistry knowledge is limited and I am helping a friend go through a similar process as Yoda's.

RE: Revised DMT extraction method

According to Yoda's method if you use DCM as opposed to Naptha, you need to be aware of which layer contains your goodies/nonpolar solvent....Yoda says that DCM sinks where as others will rise...you might place a note in the above method clarifying this point and better establishing where your goodies are placed at different points in the process....

    The battery thing was to aid in seperating emulsions. It was in one recipe I came across. The big caution was, don't let it spark if your solvent is flammable. If it's DCM the solvent is underwater so this method may be used with greater safety.

Caveat: I have not tried it myself.

This is all to much work, does anyone know where I can buy some 5MEO form (other that JLF, they're out)?

This is all too much work? If you dont think that going through the necessary procedures to obtain dmt is too much work for you, you are not ready for it IMO. DMT isnt candy for ravers or acidheads.
