What are some good agar media recipes?
These recipes are designed for agar maintenance of Psilocybe species. All media have a near-neutral pH and should be sterilized for twenty to thirty minutes at 15 psi pressure. 500 ml of medium will pour around 20 petri dishes. Using a different medium from time to time will prevent the culture getting used to one medium.
