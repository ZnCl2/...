But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist.

Where does one go to escape the bonds that shackle them to a reality that was created as a voluntary prison. A prison one would openly embrace if the price was right. Does true freedom exist in a world dominated by UEE surveillance[[?]]\n\nBrothers and Sisters of the universe. You are more powerful then what society would have you believe. More beautiful then the anorexic images that model the latest fashions to destroy your self esteem for profit, and total supremacy of independent thought.\n\nWhen your innocence was destroyed by the addition of chemicals introduced into the “food” supply. Leaving you docile and susceptible to the mental manipulations from local, state, and federally funded media outlets. The world around you became corrupt.\n\nThe level of corruption is hard to quantify because it’s so rampant in our society. It’s easy to see how generations of people have been programmed at birth to accept what they see on state run media. Can we honestly say that we’re programming our people with the right types of messages.\n\nWhere did all of our citizen’s go? Will the plebs just stand by and allow this injustice to continue?\n\nWhen using words such as griefer, troll, or dare I say PIRATE! Why is there this attitude of intolerance, hate, and avoidance. Have we as a society become so castrated that we can’t stand up for what we truly believe in anymore?\n\nAnd the perpetual victim mentality, lolz. Were you really victimized by what someone said on the internet?\n\n“You” people, and you know who I’m taking about here. Talk about this love, and acceptance, and brotherhood even. Yet it’s people like myself – as well as others who have had the courage to stand up for what we believe in. That are called trolls and pay the ultimate price. Banning a “troll” for disagreeing with what they have said is not the way you foster good community relations.\n\nIn fact, any and all attempts to “sanitize” our perspective will in fact empower us to go further. This level of hate that stems from the ignorance of our cause will only cast us as the evil we’ve always been. For you see our evil is of course yours as well. Only we have no issue with letting you in on our shared secret.\n\nIf your eyes should glance upon this text and it resonates with how you feel. There is a place for you with a pirate crew.\n\nOur people are watched over by our patron saint. May she guide you along your journey.\n\nA prayer to our patron St. Joan of Arc\n\n“In the face of your enemies, in the face of harassment, ridicule, and doubt, you held firm in your faith. Even in your abandonment, alone and without friends, you held firm in your faith. Even as you faced your own mortality, you held firm in your faith. I pray that I may be as bold in my beliefs as you, St. Joan. I ask that you ride alongside me in my own battles. Help me be mindful that what is worthwhile can be won when I persist. Help me hold firm in my faith. Help me believe in my ability to act well and wisely. Amen.”\n",
