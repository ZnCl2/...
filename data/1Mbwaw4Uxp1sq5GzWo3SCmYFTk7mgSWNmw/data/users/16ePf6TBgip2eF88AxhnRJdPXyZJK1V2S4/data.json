It's very buggy and not very enjoyable/worthwhile to use.\n\n- clicking on a link will open four identical tabs in the default browser, then will, for whatever reason, open a *new* instance of Chromium and open another tab there\n- posts sometimes don't post when you hit the post button, so you have to remember to copy the whole thing or otherwise risk losing your post\n- strong bent towards leftist developers; not very friendly/welcoming towards other communities\n- can't use the same identity on multiple devices without ugly hacks",
