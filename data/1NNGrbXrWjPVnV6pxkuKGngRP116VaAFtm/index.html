<h2 style="text-align: center">Foot Fetish..</h2>
A sexual attraction to usually women's feet. The pedicured toes,smooth soft soles and high arch on a woman's feet can be sexually arousing. There's a sexual attraction to feet because, feet are sometimes hidden as are other body parts. And when seeing just the curvy shape under a woman's socks, one might feel curious, and wonder what they look like. The attraction for feet starts at a young age.

Not all feet are attractive,if someone has a foot fetish, don't look around and assume any feet will be attractive to that person. Many people are embarrassed to admit their attraction for feet because they are not sure if the attraction is right..

    <h2 style="text-align: center">Its Perfectly Normal..</h2>
Your feet deserve love. They're your base of support, and they take you everywhere you go. If any part of your body deserves some extra attention, it's probably your feet. And, according to Moushimi Ghose, a Los Angeles-based sex therapist, there are plenty of people out there with a foot fetish who would love to shower them with attention. Having a foot fetish just means that you're turned on by feet, and the kink often involves a psychological element of domination and humiliation, Ghose says.

The humiliation aspect of foot fetishes may include the fetishist wanting to have your feet placed on their face after all, your feet walk on the ground all day long, so they may be dirty and even smelly. They're also at the very bottom of your body. This is all part of the turn on for some foot fetishists. Of course, you don't have to smear your partner's head with your foot sweat to indulge in a foot fetish. There are many ways to try out this kink if you're intrigued by feet but not sure where to start. "As with any fetish, it's really up to the individual to explore and figure out what they enjoy about it," says Goddess Aviva, a lifestyle and professional dominatrix. No matter how you practice your foot fetish, the most important thing to know beyond technique is that you're 100% normal. "A lot of people wonder if they are weird or perverted for having a foot fetish, but I can tell you it's actually quite common," Aviva says. "It's also a lot of fun."
