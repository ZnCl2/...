			"body": "Almost all the data in most zites are seeded by everyone who has downloaded that zite - which means that when you redownload the zites from a fresh ZeroNet install, you will have your data on there, and as long as you have backed up the `users.json`, you will have the private key to be able to modify that data once again.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily apply to zites where you may have uploaded files that are optional files. If the files have 0 seeders, then you would want to back up those files. However, if it has more than 0 seeders, then there is a chance that you can download those files again.",
