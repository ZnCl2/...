			"body": "Hello all. This is my first question here and I have been on zeronet for a couple of days only.\n\nI have been using zeronet with tor through tor browser till now, and i have started setting a personal blog in here. However i have read in a redit post, a comment i haven't been able to verify. According to it, zites that are seeded by tor users in zeronet, can only be accessed by other zeronet users that also use tor.\n\nIs this true? I mean, if i set up my site, the only ones that can read it are the people that use tor or have i terribly misunderstood the reddit comment?\n\nAnyway, thanks for your time",
