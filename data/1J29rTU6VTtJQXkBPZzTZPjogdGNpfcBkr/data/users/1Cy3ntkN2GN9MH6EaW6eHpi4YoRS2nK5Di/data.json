Posting in answer section 'cause that may be useful for most.\n\n---\n\nPretend you cloned ZeroWiki, changed HTML for translation (#1) and then edited main page for translation (#2).\n\n#1 will be lost after pressing `Upgrade code`, #2 won't. Why? Because #1 was changed in HTML which is updated, and #2 was changed in `data.json` which isn't updated. Update code updates pulls all files except user content.\n\nIn analogy with Git: GitHub merges changes with `recursive` strategy, and ZeroNet uses `ours`.\n\n---\n\nSo you will be able to correctly merge changes via GitHub. For example, you can clone ZeroWiki repository, go back to revision when you cloned ZeroWiki, start a new branch there and commit all your changes. Then merge master into new branch.\n\nIf you want to look at how to use GitHub for hosting zites, look at [ZeroTalk](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroTalk), [ZeroMe](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroMe) or [Git Center](https://github.com/imachug/gitcenter) repositories.",

			"body": "Unfortunately, you cannot delete your site entirely. But, depending on what you want and what you have, it is partly possible.\n\nIf you just cloned a site, press `Delete` in sidebar. If you used `.bit` domain, free it.\n\nSpeaking about freing ZeroNet address: why do you need it? It is impossible to bruteforce private key if public key is given. So there is very little possibility that anyone can even create a site on your address.\n\nSo the only usecase for freing ZeroNet address is forbidding peers to download content. For that, you can delete all files of your site except `content.json`, add `index.html` with `This site was deleted by the owner` and then sign&publish zite.",
