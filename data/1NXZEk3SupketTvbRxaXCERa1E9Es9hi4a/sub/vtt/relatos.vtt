00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.032
¿Tienes espacio para uno más?

2
00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.786
¿Tienes espacio para uno más?3

3
00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:23.830
Let me ask you,
my ticket was paid by a company,

4
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:27.125
¿Tienes espacio para uno más?6

5
00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:30.379
No, there are no miles for this fare.

6
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.423
I see. Never mind, then.

7
00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:36.301
Boarding is through gate 3.

8
00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:41.302
Thanks.

9
00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:02.327
I'll help you.

10
00:02:02.328 --> 00:02:07.328
Fine.

11
00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:38.530
Business or pleasure?

12
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:42.659
Both, I hope.

13
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.953
What do you do?

14
00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:48.749
I'm a model.

15
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.876
Sorry, I should have figured.

16
00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:53.545
Thank you.

17
00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:55.130
Catwalk or advertising?

18
00:02:55.131 --> 00:03:00.131
Catwalk.

19
00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:03.847
And you, what do you do sir?

20
00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:05.891
- You're killing me.
- Why?

21
00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:06.892
You said "sir"

22
00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:11.021
and I sank
to the fifth circle of hell.

23
00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:15.442
I have to do something
about my hair.

24
00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:19.738
I'm a music critic.
Sounds horrible, I know.

25
00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.491
It doesn't.
Rock?

26
00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:25.494
Now you're trying to be nice.

27
00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:28.580
Classical music.

28
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:29.831
I see.

29
00:03:29.832 --> 00:03:32.376
My first boyfriend
was a classical musician.

30
00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:35.128
Well, that's what he studied.

31
00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.254
What's his name?

32
00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:38.840
No, he's not famous.

33
00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:42.761
He sent in some works
back when we were together,

34
00:03:42.762 --> 00:03:45.639
but they were never published.

35
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.684
Or printed.
What's the right word'?

36
00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:53.685
Choose whatever term you like
and I'll make it popular.

37
00:03:55.316 --> 00:04:00.316
Pasternak. Gabriel Pasternak.

38
00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:08.412
Pasternak...

39
00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:12.374
If I'd known it, I'd have told you
I was a gravedigger, not a critic.

40
00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:15.752
He submitted his thesis
at the Conservatory of Music

41
00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:19.256
when I was president of the jury.
I ripped him apart.

42
00:04:19.257 --> 00:04:21.258
Yes, I was with him at the time.

43
00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.926
What you did to him was awful.

44
00:04:22.927 --> 00:04:25.846
He spent a week in bed
after reading the review.

45
00:04:25.847 --> 00:04:29.182
Sometimes I have to destroy
some poor guy's self- esteem

46
00:04:29.183 --> 00:04:31.977
to protect the ears
of an entire population.

47
00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:35.230
I may be wrong sometimes,
but in this case...

48
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:38.525
His work was...

49
00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:41.903
a dreadful monstrosity.

50
00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:43.905
Are you still in touch with him?

51
00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:46.199
We didn't end on great terms.

52
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.035
But I'm still fond of him.
He was a good guy.

53
00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:53.165
Maybe, but if you present
a piece like that to a jury

54
00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.917
there has to be
something wrong with you.

55
00:04:55.918 --> 00:04:58.837
Gabriel Pasternak!
How could I forget him?

56
00:04:58.838 --> 00:05:01.423
We laughed about it for months.

57
00:05:01.424 --> 00:05:06.424
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I was listening to you.

58
00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:09.014
What a huge coincidence!

59
00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:11.600
Gabriel Pasternak
was my student

60
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:15.145
at Palomar Elementary School.

61
00:05:15.146 --> 00:05:19.900
I had to tell him
he was being held back.

62
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:23.612
I can assure you:
the kid had issues.

63
00:05:23.613 --> 00:05:26.698
I've never seen anything like it
in 30 years as a teacher.

64
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.325
He was screaming

65
00:05:28.326 --> 00:05:31.536
and crying like a newborn baby.

66
00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:34.372
Miss Leguizamén?

67
00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:37.209
Ignacio Fontana.
Remember me'?

68
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.003
Ignacio Fontana!

69
00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:43.799
Unbelievable!
There's a cosmic connection here.

70
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.677
Wasn't Pasternak one of your classmates?

71
00:05:47.678 --> 00:05:51.181
- Are you friends with him?
- Intimate friends.

72
00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:54.059
Poor guy, we were awful to him.

73
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.603
This is beyond unbelievable.

74
00:05:56.604 --> 00:05:58.605
I was a manager at Home Depot,

75
00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:01.983
where this psycho you mentioned
worked for a while.

76
00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:05.612
He always had trouble with customers,
so we had to let him go.

77
00:06:05.613 --> 00:06:08.073
- And when I...
- Excuse me.

78
00:06:08.074 --> 00:06:11.284
Does anyone else know Gabriel Pasternak?

79
00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:12.744
- Me.
- Me too.

80
00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:15.163
Why?

81
00:06:15.164 --> 00:06:16.998
Why are you on this plane?

82
00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.668
Did you buy your tickets?

83
00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.547
I'm in real estate,
they sent it to me to check out a farm.

84
00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:26.174
I have a meeting
with the Tourism Secretary.

85
00:06:26.175 --> 00:06:28.134
They bought the ticket.

86
00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:29.469
I won mine in a raffle.

87
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.470
I couldn't change the date.
I had to fly today.

88
00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:45.485
Gabriel Pasternak is
the cabin chief on this flight.

89
00:06:45.486 --> 00:06:48.154
We did our training together,
we were friends.

90
00:06:48.155 --> 00:06:51.324
Then he asked me out
and when I refused, he started to get...

91
00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:52.993
Never mind.

92
00:06:52.994 --> 00:06:55.996
After takeoff,
he brought coffee to the cockpit.

93
00:06:55.997 --> 00:06:58.582
The door is locked,
the pilots won't answer,

94
00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:03.583
I'm desperate!
I don't know what to do!

95
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.510
I cheated on him
with his only friend.

96
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:15.511
With him!

97
00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:27.694
Gabriel!
Gabriel, are you there?

98
00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:28.612
It's Victor,

99
00:07:28.613 --> 00:07:30.071
Victor Jensen!

100
00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:31.573
Talk to me, please!

101
00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:34.534
- Who are you?
- I was his psychiatrist for years.

102
00:07:34.535 --> 00:07:38.246
Then I raised my fees,
he got mad and stopped seeing me.

103
00:07:38.247 --> 00:07:39.789
Open the door, Gabriel!
Listen!

104
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.919
It's not your fault!
You're just a victim here!

105
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.837
I'm telling you, plain and simple:

106
00:07:45.838 --> 00:07:48.590
it was your parents
who ruined your life!

107
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.343
They asked too much of you
ever since you were born,

108
00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:54.512
they projected all their
disappointments on you!

109
00:07:54.513 --> 00:07:56.973
They are responsible
for your suffering!

110
00:07:56.974 --> 00:07:59.601
Gabriel, no one here...

111
00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:04.602
has anything to do with it!

112
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:27.351
WILD TALES

113
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.694
Good evening.
Party of one?

114
00:10:56.695 --> 00:10:59.948
I see you're good at math.

115
00:10:59.949 --> 00:11:02.534
One, yes.

116
00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:07.535
Wherever you like.

117
00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:19.259
Today's special
is lentils and rice stew.

118
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.260
Delicious!

119
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:48.951
Did he order?

120
00:11:49.915 --> 00:11:53.918
That guy's from my hometown.

121
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:58.840
He's a loan shark, a gangster.

122
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.718
He auctioned our house.

123
00:12:01.719 --> 00:12:06.719
Because of him,
my father killed himself.

124
00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:10.476
Two weeks after the funeral,

125
00:12:10.477 --> 00:12:14.439
he tried to seduce my mom.

126
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.440
He wouldn't leave her alone
so we moved here.

127
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.697
You know how many times

128
00:12:22.698 --> 00:12:25.909
I dreamed of having him

129
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.204
right in front of me?

130
00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:32.540
I'm going to say something.

131
00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:35.001
Say something?

132
00:12:35.002 --> 00:12:37.253
Your dad kills himself
because of this guy,

133
00:12:37.254 --> 00:12:41.007
and you're just going
to insult him?

134
00:12:41.008 --> 00:12:46.008
Let's put rat poison in his food.

135
00:12:46.096 --> 00:12:47.639
There's some in the storeroom.

136
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.640
A good dose and his heart
will blow in five minutes.

137
00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.989
Lots of work?

138
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.783
Not with this weather...

139
00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:09.744
I've been trying to get your attention
for a while.

140
00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:13.289
You need to check on
your customers, honey.

141
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.667
Sorry.
Can I take your order?

142
00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:17.710
French fries with fried eggs.

143
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:22.711
I'll order something else
if I'm still hungry.

144
00:13:23.926 --> 00:13:26.261
- To drink?
- Diet Coke.

145
00:13:26.262 --> 00:13:28.054
Diet Coke?

146
00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:30.431
Diet Coke.

147
00:13:30.432 --> 00:13:32.517
French fries, fried eggs.

148
00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:37.518
Want me to write it?

149
00:13:38.107 --> 00:13:43.107
I hate him!

150
00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:49.863
Make him French fries with fried eggs.

151
00:13:50.286 --> 00:13:54.205
Are you crazy?
Want me to go to prison?

152
00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:56.541
To prison?

153
00:13:56.542 --> 00:14:00.795
Who'll do the autopsy on this jerk?
The FBI?

154
00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:02.547
French fries with fried eggs.

155
00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:07.548
They'll think the cholesterol
killed him.

156
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.430
Just cook his meal, will you?

157
00:14:21.358 --> 00:14:23.401
Can I have your opinion?

158
00:14:23.402 --> 00:14:28.402
You seem like a smart girl.
Come here.

159
00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:33.328
Which do you like better? This one?

160
00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:35.330
CUENCA = SAFETY

161
00:14:35.331 --> 00:14:37.206
Or this one?

162
00:14:37.207 --> 00:14:38.333
The red one.

163
00:14:38.334 --> 00:14:43.334
The red one.
Hold on.

164
00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:45.298
Don't I look too serious?

165
00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:46.966
No, I think it's fine.

166
00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:51.967
Thank you.

167
00:14:54.475 --> 00:14:57.018
Besides, prison's not that bad.

168
00:14:57.019 --> 00:14:59.312
It just has bad reputation.

169
00:14:59.313 --> 00:15:03.274
They feed you, you don't pay rent,

170
00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:05.693
you have nothing to worry about.

171
00:15:05.694 --> 00:15:09.280
And if you make nice friends,
you can have a good time.

172
00:15:09.281 --> 00:15:11.616
You play cards...

173
00:15:11.617 --> 00:15:13.701
Were you in prison?

174
00:15:13.702 --> 00:15:15.578
A While.

175
00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:19.123
And I felt freer in there than here.

176
00:15:19.124 --> 00:15:21.000
This is shit.

177
00:15:21.001 --> 00:15:23.169
What did you do?

178
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:28.170
Nothing I regret.

179
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.553
And he's running for mayor!

180
00:15:32.554 --> 00:15:35.390
That son of a bitch.
Can you believe it?

181
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:38.851
Of course I can.
Bastards rule the world.

182
00:15:38.852 --> 00:15:42.814
Wake up, kid!

183
00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:44.649
$0?

184
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:49.650
Shall we do the community a favor?

185
00:15:52.616 --> 00:15:57.616
Great!

186
00:16:20.644 --> 00:16:23.312
You did it.

187
00:16:23.313 --> 00:16:27.066
Don't play naive,
as if you hadn't noticed.

188
00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:30.027
What?

189
00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:31.237
That's our country.

190
00:16:31.238 --> 00:16:34.031
Everyone wants these guys
to get what they deserve,

191
00:16:34.032 --> 00:16:37.285
but no one
is willing to lift a finger.

192
00:16:37.286 --> 00:16:39.996
Be proud, kid.

193
00:16:39.997 --> 00:16:44.292
For once in your miserable life,
you're doing something worthwhile.

194
00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:47.128
- I'm not doing anything.
- You're not?

195
00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:50.381
You stay here arguing instead of
taking the food away from him.

196
00:16:50.382 --> 00:16:52.049
Relax.

197
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.385
You have nothing to worry about.

198
00:16:54.386 --> 00:16:58.181
If there's an investigation,
I'll say I used rat poison in the kitchen

199
00:16:58.182 --> 00:17:01.684
because we were infested,
which is true, by the way,

200
00:17:01.685 --> 00:17:04.187
and some of it,
accidentally fell into a pot.

201
00:17:04.188 --> 00:17:08.357
What will they say?

202
00:17:08.358 --> 00:17:13.358
This is insane.

203
00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:18.655
Could this shit be expired?

204
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.998
There's no expiration date.

205
00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:25.458
How does it work?

206
00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:30.459
If rat poison is expired,
is it more or less harmful?

207
00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:50.858
- Everything OK?
- Yes.

208
00:17:50.859 --> 00:17:55.859
Have a seat.

209
00:18:06.458 --> 00:18:10.419
- What are you having, Alexis?
- Fanta, maybe?

210
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.880
- Should I warm it up?
- No! Leave it.

211
00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:15.508
If I need you to warm it up, I'll ask.

212
00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:20.509
Can I have a Fanta, please?

213
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.140
I've had it with this girl.

214
00:18:30.357 --> 00:18:32.275
We have to do something,
they're both eating.

215
00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:34.527
- Add more poison?
- He's just a kid!

216
00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:37.280
But he'll grow up.
Like father, like son.

217
00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:42.281
We'd better wipe out
the whole family tree.

218
00:18:43.745 --> 00:18:47.290
I'm feeling a bit...

219
00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:51.210
What's wrong?

220
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:52.086
Are you OK?

221
00:18:52.087 --> 00:18:53.421
This must be freezing cold.

222
00:18:53.422 --> 00:18:55.464
No, stop!

223
00:18:55.465 --> 00:19:00.465
Who the fuck taught you
how to wait tables? Leave.

224
00:19:12.649 --> 00:19:16.152
You goddamned fucking bitch!

225
00:19:16.153 --> 00:19:17.570
Stop it, dad!

226
00:19:17.571 --> 00:19:19.113
Pick everything up.

227
00:19:19.114 --> 00:19:21.866
Pick it up, I said.

228
00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:23.367
Call an ambulance!

229
00:19:23.368 --> 00:19:26.078
Pick them up, one by one!

230
00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:28.289
Take this!

231
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.708
Take this, you thug!

232
00:19:30.709 --> 00:19:35.709
I'll gut you like a chicken!

233
00:21:44.342 --> 00:21:49.342
Come on, moron, move over.

234
00:21:55.729 --> 00:22:00.729
What's your problem?

235
00:22:04.905 --> 00:22:09.905
What a piece of shit!

236
00:22:18.376 --> 00:22:21.629
You motherfucking redneck!

237
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.630
Asshole!

238
00:22:33.016 --> 00:22:38.016
Holy Jesus.

239
00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:06.461
I can't believe it.

240
00:24:45.899 --> 00:24:47.066
Hello.

241
00:24:47.067 --> 00:24:52.067
I'm at Kilometer 60
on the route between Salta and...

242
00:24:52.906 --> 00:24:54.073
Yes, sorry.

243
00:24:54.074 --> 00:24:57.534
UIA719.

244
00:24:57.535 --> 00:25:00.579
Diego lturralde.

245
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.623
Fine.

246
00:25:02.624 --> 00:25:05.501
I was saying, I have a flat tire,
at Kilometer 6O

247
00:25:05.502 --> 00:25:10.502
on the route between
Salta and Cafayate.

248
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:14.385
I'd like to know,
how quick can you get here?

249
00:25:14.386 --> 00:25:19.386
See, the car's new
and I'm not handy with the jack.

250
00:26:33.131 --> 00:26:34.715
What's wrong?

251
00:26:34.716 --> 00:26:36.550
Did you get scared?

252
00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:39.011
Come on, man, drive on.

253
00:26:39.012 --> 00:26:44.012
Keep driving, come on!

254
00:27:11.419 --> 00:27:14.296
Let it go, I don't want a fight.

255
00:27:14.297 --> 00:27:17.174
If I offended you, I apologize.

256
00:27:17.175 --> 00:27:22.175
I'm sorry if I did.

257
00:27:25.892 --> 00:27:28.060
Are you done?

258
00:27:28.061 --> 00:27:31.063
Are you finished?

259
00:27:31.064 --> 00:27:36.064
Careful with...

260
00:27:36.986 --> 00:27:40.280
What are you... Stop!

261
00:27:40.281 --> 00:27:42.491
Come on, man,
I didn't do anything.

262
00:27:42.492 --> 00:27:47.492
What was it you called me back there?

263
00:28:22.907 --> 00:28:27.907
Oh God!

264
00:28:29.664 --> 00:28:33.000
I already apologized.
What more do you want?

265
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:38.001
I'll get out of the car if I have to,
but I don't think it's necessary.

266
00:28:38.047 --> 00:28:39.423
Fuck!

267
00:28:39.424 --> 00:28:44.424
Stop!

268
00:28:45.263 --> 00:28:46.930
Good morning, officer.

269
00:28:46.931 --> 00:28:48.724
I'm at Kilometer 60

270
00:28:48.725 --> 00:28:51.059
of the route
between Salta and Cafayate

271
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.896
and I'm being attacked by a man.

272
00:28:53.897 --> 00:28:55.898
It's shatterproof, you won't break it!

273
00:28:55.899 --> 00:28:57.191
You pussy!

274
00:28:57.192 --> 00:28:59.568
The man's license plate is...

275
00:28:59.569 --> 00:29:04.569
I can't see it,
can you send a patrol car, please?

276
00:29:06.367 --> 00:29:08.285
Perfect.

277
00:29:08.286 --> 00:29:13.286
Hurry, he's out of control!

278
00:29:14.334 --> 00:29:19.334
I'm sure they'll be here any minute.

279
00:29:19.631 --> 00:29:22.007
Give it a rest, man!

280
00:29:22.008 --> 00:29:27.008
You wrecked my car! Get lost!

281
00:29:31.184 --> 00:29:36.184
What are you doing?

282
00:29:42.362 --> 00:29:44.988
Son of a bitch!

283
00:29:44.989 --> 00:29:48.784
You son of a bitch!

284
00:29:48.785 --> 00:29:53.785
Fucking bastard!
Motherfucker!

285
00:29:59.337 --> 00:30:04.337
Please!

286
00:30:25.405 --> 00:30:30.405
Pussy!

287
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:11.533
What are you doing?

288
00:31:11.534 --> 00:31:16.534
Stop, you prick!

289
00:32:26.067 --> 00:32:28.151
You're dead!

290
00:32:28.152 --> 00:32:30.570
I have your license plate,
you son of a bitch!

291
00:32:30.571 --> 00:32:31.738
Did you hear me?

292
00:32:31.739 --> 00:32:34.324
I have your license plate! UIA!

293
00:32:34.325 --> 00:32:39.325
I'll hunt you down and kill you!

294
00:33:44.604 --> 00:33:49.604
Resetting...

295
00:37:45.678 --> 00:37:47.929
Attention, dispatch.
Truck 29 here.

296
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:52.930
Confirm location, please?

297
00:38:14.999 --> 00:38:19.999
Dispatch, dispatch!

298
00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:33.558
What's your theory, sheriff?

299
00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:38.559
Crime of passion?

300
00:39:21.857 --> 00:39:23.900
How's it going outside?

301
00:39:23.901 --> 00:39:28.901
Ready to go, Simén.

302
00:40:00.771 --> 00:40:05.771
Thank you.

303
00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:15.702
Let's do it.

304
00:40:15.703 --> 00:40:19.247
Attention, we're detonating!

305
00:40:19.248 --> 00:40:24.248
Five, four...

306
00:40:51.906 --> 00:40:56.906
Good job.

307
00:41:04.126 --> 00:41:06.669
There, please.

308
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:11.174
Sign.

309
00:41:11.175 --> 00:41:13.468
Yes,honey?

310
00:41:13.469 --> 00:41:18.469
I'll stop by the office, make a few calls
and be on my way.

311
00:41:18.557 --> 00:41:22.018
I'll be there at 5 with the cake.

312
00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:27.019
I'll be there on time, don't worry.

313
00:41:43.916 --> 00:41:46.709
I hope she likes it.

314
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.877
Yes, she'll love it.

315
00:41:47.878 --> 00:41:52.878
Thank you.

316
00:42:03.268 --> 00:42:06.104
That's 360 pesos.

317
00:42:06.105 --> 00:42:08.481
What is it, imported'?

318
00:42:08.482 --> 00:42:09.899
One, two...

319
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.234
Do you have a receipt?

320
00:42:11.235 --> 00:42:14.487
Yes, we've got cakes, pastries...

321
00:42:14.488 --> 00:42:16.948
A sales slip, a receipt.

322
00:42:16.949 --> 00:42:21.949
Yes, sure, I'll get it for you.

323
00:43:10.753 --> 00:43:15.753
You gang of thieves!

324
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:31.773
Next!

325
00:43:31.774 --> 00:43:35.151
Hello. I parked my car...

326
00:43:35.152 --> 00:43:40.152
Car registration, please.

327
00:43:42.451 --> 00:43:44.786
- I don't like that tone.
- I'm being polite, sir.

328
00:43:44.787 --> 00:43:48.539
I don't think so.

329
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.500
The towing fee is 490 pesos

330
00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:53.294
and the parking ticket
will be sent to your address.

331
00:43:53.295 --> 00:43:56.339
But I'm trying to explain.

332
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.966
The curb wasn't painted yellow,

333
00:43:58.967 --> 00:44:01.928
there was no way I could have known

334
00:44:01.929 --> 00:44:03.930
it was a no-parking zone.

335
00:44:03.931 --> 00:44:04.889
I understand.

336
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:08.601
If you want to get your car back,
you have to pay the towing fee.

337
00:44:08.602 --> 00:44:10.853
Then you can file a complaint
Monday to Friday,

338
00:44:10.854 --> 00:44:15.854
8 to <i>2</i> pm, at the DMV,
Carlos Pellegrini 211, 1st floor.

339
00:44:18.612 --> 00:44:21.906
Let's do something else.

340
00:44:21.907 --> 00:44:24.659
Go and talk to whoever you need to,

341
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.538
I want to leave with my car
without paying a penny,

342
00:44:28.539 --> 00:44:31.499
I want a refund for the cab

343
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.085
and I want an apology.

344
00:44:34.086 --> 00:44:35.837
Why are you laughing?
I'm serious.

345
00:44:35.838 --> 00:44:38.840
Where is the office
where apologies are made?

346
00:44:38.841 --> 00:44:42.718
We're all in the same boat.
Please hurry up.

347
00:44:42.719 --> 00:44:45.138
The parking ticket
indicates you committed an infraction,

348
00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:47.014
we don't need further proof.

349
00:44:47.015 --> 00:44:50.434
Once again, if you want your oar back,
you need to pay.

350
00:44:50.435 --> 00:44:53.020
Otherwise, please leave
so I can go on working.

351
00:44:53.021 --> 00:44:54.230
If I don't have cash?

352
00:44:54.231 --> 00:44:56.899
We accept credit and debit cards,
or come back tomorrow,

353
00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:01.571
but you'll be charged parking fee.

354
00:45:01.572 --> 00:45:05.283
- You know you're a criminal?
- I'm doing my job.

355
00:45:05.284 --> 00:45:08.786
People who work for criminals
are criminals too.

356
00:45:08.787 --> 00:45:11.122
Right. That's your opinion.

357
00:45:11.123 --> 00:45:16.123
Just a miserable slave
to this corrupt system.

358
00:45:20.799 --> 00:45:25.799
Thank you, have a nice day.

359
00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:47.070
Almost there

360
00:45:54.958 --> 00:45:59.958
Don't bother.
Almost everyone's gone

361
00:46:33.247 --> 00:46:38.247
Happy birthday, Camila

362
00:46:42.965 --> 00:46:47.218
Happy birthday, precious.

363
00:46:47.219 --> 00:46:49.470
Can't we do it again?

364
00:46:49.471 --> 00:46:52.640
Forget about it, Simén.

365
00:46:52.641 --> 00:46:57.641
Hello, baby, happy birthday.

366
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.772
Here's the cake.

367
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:01.232
Hello, kids.

368
00:47:01.233 --> 00:47:02.900
Hi, Antonio, how are you?

369
00:47:02.901 --> 00:47:03.651
HeHo,dean

370
00:47:03.652 --> 00:47:07.697
- How are you?
- Fine.

371
00:47:07.698 --> 00:47:08.823
We were just leaving.

372
00:47:08.824 --> 00:47:12.076
I'm the father.

373
00:47:12.077 --> 00:47:17.077
I'll see you out.

374
00:47:21.795 --> 00:47:25.548
Why not get a cab
and pick up the car later?

375
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:28.050
You missed your daughter's birthday!

376
00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:31.345
You make it sound so easy.
I'm tired of being robbed!

377
00:47:31.346 --> 00:47:35.182
The curb was not painted yellow!

378
00:47:35.183 --> 00:47:38.436
Do you have any idea
how furious that makes me?

379
00:47:38.437 --> 00:47:40.688
Do you have any idea
how furious it makes me

380
00:47:40.689 --> 00:47:43.232
that you always have an excuse?

381
00:47:43.233 --> 00:47:45.359
That you blame society
for everything?

382
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.862
Today was the tow truck,
yesterday was traffic,

383
00:47:47.863 --> 00:47:49.405
tomorrow it'll be the rally.

384
00:47:49.406 --> 00:47:52.658
The truth is
you could have left earlier.

385
00:47:52.659 --> 00:47:54.952
You could have helped me set up

386
00:47:54.953 --> 00:47:57.621
and have been here to welcome
your daughter's friends.

387
00:47:57.622 --> 00:48:01.167
But everything else is a priority
except your family.

388
00:48:01.168 --> 00:48:04.045
And I'm such a fool to think
one day you'll change.

389
00:48:04.046 --> 00:48:05.713
But you know what?

390
00:48:05.714 --> 00:48:07.923
Society won't change.

391
00:48:07.924 --> 00:48:10.468
You won't change.

392
00:48:10.469 --> 00:48:15.469
And I'm tired.

393
00:48:15.766 --> 00:48:18.559
What's that supposed to mean?

394
00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.560
You're the engineer.
Do the math.

395
00:48:24.649 --> 00:48:28.069
The government allows a company
to rake in the big bucks from these fines.

396
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:32.615
Obviously,
our elected officials get their cut.

397
00:48:32.616 --> 00:48:34.909
It's outrageous,
but that's how it is.

398
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:38.996
You have two options:
pay and relax

399
00:48:38.997 --> 00:48:43.334
or you give yourself
a heart attack.

400
00:48:43.335 --> 00:48:45.211
You know what?

401
00:48:45.212 --> 00:48:47.421
I have plenty to live for.

402
00:48:47.422 --> 00:48:50.925
I want to sail, travel around the
world with my grandchildren...

403
00:48:50.926 --> 00:48:52.718
- Don't get so upset.
- Right.

404
00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:57.719
Take it easy.

405
00:49:00.977 --> 00:49:02.770
Good morning.

406
00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:06.190
I got this ticket.
I already paid the towing fee,

407
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:09.485
but there's been a mistake,
the curb wasn't painted yellow.

408
00:49:09.486 --> 00:49:14.281
- May I?
- Sure.

409
00:49:14.282 --> 00:49:18.828
It's 560 pesos.

410
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:20.079
Listen,

411
00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.080
I'm a bit anxious about this,
so please, hear me out.

412
00:49:26.628 --> 00:49:29.630
The curb wasn't painted.

413
00:49:29.631 --> 00:49:33.050
I think you should send someone
to the address of the infraction

414
00:49:33.051 --> 00:49:35.719
so you can check I'm right.

415
00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.055
Then, on behalf of the city government,
you should apologize,

416
00:49:38.056 --> 00:49:39.598
because I'm right,

417
00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:41.892
you should give me back
the towing fees

418
00:49:41.893 --> 00:49:46.063
and compensate me for all the time
I'm wasting.

419
00:49:46.064 --> 00:49:47.106
According to the ticket,

420
00:49:47.107 --> 00:49:49.442
your car
was in a no-parking zone.

421
00:49:49.443 --> 00:49:51.444
That's proof enough.

422
00:49:51.445 --> 00:49:55.322
The fine is 560 pesos
and you have to pay it either way.

423
00:49:55.323 --> 00:49:58.868
If you don't,
interests will start accumulating.

424
00:49:58.869 --> 00:50:01.287
Are you listening?

425
00:50:01.288 --> 00:50:03.289
Proof enough my ass!

426
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:06.709
I'm telling you the curb
was not painted yellow.

427
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:10.379
First, don't insult me.
I'm doing my job.

428
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.216
Second, you should know
how the law works.

429
00:50:14.217 --> 00:50:15.926
The fact that you don't know it

430
00:50:15.927 --> 00:50:19.305
doesn't mean you can avoid
the consequences for breaking it.

431
00:50:19.306 --> 00:50:22.391
If you kill someone and say:
"I didn't know I couldn't do that,"

432
00:50:22.392 --> 00:50:23.684
YOU go to jail.

433
00:50:23.685 --> 00:50:27.646
Maybe no one told you that,
but you'll go to jail anyway.

434
00:50:27.647 --> 00:50:28.522
Get the picture?

435
00:50:28.523 --> 00:50:31.525
That example is pretty inaccurate.

436
00:50:31.526 --> 00:50:36.526
I'm supposed to know by heart
where I am not allowed to park,

437
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:39.241
whether the spaces are marked or not'?

438
00:50:39.242 --> 00:50:40.242
Exactly.

439
00:50:40.243 --> 00:50:43.662
That information
is available on the DMV website.

440
00:50:43.663 --> 00:50:45.289
I see.

441
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:48.501
- Can you call your superior?
- There are none.

442
00:50:48.502 --> 00:50:49.585
Really?

443
00:50:49.586 --> 00:50:52.796
What are you?
The fucking president?

444
00:50:52.797 --> 00:50:54.840
Sir, there's a lot of people here.

445
00:50:54.841 --> 00:50:58.636
If you're not going to pay,
please step aside.

446
00:50:58.637 --> 00:51:01.472
How does it feel to be a crook?
Tell me.

447
00:51:01.473 --> 00:51:02.765
Security, window 7!

448
00:51:02.766 --> 00:51:05.351
Security?
Great!

449
00:51:05.352 --> 00:51:06.727
I'm submitting a complaint,

450
00:51:06.728 --> 00:51:09.730
exercising my rights as a citizen,
that makes me a criminal?

451
00:51:09.731 --> 00:51:13.359
Want to call security?

452
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.988
Call security! Go ahead!

453
00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:19.740
Call them now! Do it!

454
00:51:19.741 --> 00:51:24.741
What are you doing?
Get off me!

455
00:51:31.836 --> 00:51:36.836
Sign here, please.

456
00:51:51.523 --> 00:51:53.399
- Hey, buddy.
- How are you?

457
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.319
They didn't rape you, did they?

458
00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.446
This is unbelievable.

459
00:51:59.447 --> 00:52:02.950
This is really... unbelievable.

460
00:52:02.951 --> 00:52:04.618
It's crazy.

461
00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:08.372
Seijas sent the company lawyer
to take care of everything.

462
00:52:08.373 --> 00:52:13.373
Finally some goodwill,
because lately...

463
00:52:14.588 --> 00:52:17.089
Maybe that's not the right word...

464
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.217
Your name is all over the news,

465
00:52:20.218 --> 00:52:22.970
along with the company's name.

466
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:26.265
Seijas's partners aren't too happy.

467
00:52:26.266 --> 00:52:31.266
The city government
is one of our biggest clients.

468
00:52:33.148 --> 00:52:37.359
They're letting you go, Simén.

469
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.655
It's been decided.

470
00:52:41.656 --> 00:52:45.576
You're currently unemployed,
Mr. Fischer.

471
00:52:45.577 --> 00:52:47.911
Why, is that a crime?

472
00:52:47.912 --> 00:52:50.998
I never said that.

473
00:52:50.999 --> 00:52:54.877
But it sounded like
that's what you were implying.

474
00:52:54.878 --> 00:52:57.379
It's not a crime,
but it is a problem

475
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.549
when you have to provide
for your family every month.

476
00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:03.260
She's referring to child support,

477
00:53:03.261 --> 00:53:06.639
which includes clothing,
tuition, medical insurance.

478
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.351
Excuse me.

479
00:53:10.352 --> 00:53:14.313
I've supported my wife year round
ever since I met her.

480
00:53:14.314 --> 00:53:16.940
And my daughter will always have
what she needs.

481
00:53:16.941 --> 00:53:20.027
If I have a problem,
don't worry, I'll work it out.

482
00:53:20.028 --> 00:53:23.697
Fortunately my client is now working,

483
00:53:23.698 --> 00:53:28.243
so we don't see why Mr. Fischer
should have shared custody.

484
00:53:28.244 --> 00:53:31.372
Excuse me.

485
00:53:31.373 --> 00:53:34.875
I've been paying for everything
for years.

486
00:53:34.876 --> 00:53:38.045
Just because this month
she's employed and I'm not,

487
00:53:38.046 --> 00:53:42.091
I don't have the right
to joint custody of our daughter?

488
00:53:42.092 --> 00:53:45.928
I hope the judge realizes
how unfair this situation is.

489
00:53:45.929 --> 00:53:47.930
What the judge will realize

490
00:53:47.931 --> 00:53:50.224
is how violent you are
when you refer to your wife...

491
00:53:50.225 --> 00:53:52.893
What violence?

492
00:53:52.894 --> 00:53:57.231
I'm describing reality,
where do you see violence?

493
00:53:57.232 --> 00:54:00.526
I see violence all over the place,
Mr. Fischer.

494
00:54:00.527 --> 00:54:02.569
I see violence on the streets,

495
00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:05.072
when I turn on the TV.

496
00:54:05.073 --> 00:54:09.993
And I see violence
in this newspaper article.

497
00:54:09.994 --> 00:54:14.994
I'm convinced that less contact
a child has with this kind of event,

498
00:54:14.999 --> 00:54:17.501
the better it'll be for her well-being.

499
00:54:17.502 --> 00:54:21.171
Victoria, do you want to take
my daughter away from me'?

500
00:54:21.172 --> 00:54:23.465
No, I don't want to take
your daughter away from you.

501
00:54:23.466 --> 00:54:26.468
What's wrong?
Are you going crazy?

502
00:54:26.469 --> 00:54:29.346
My client and I are finished here,

503
00:54:29.347 --> 00:54:33.684
we'll see each other again in court.

504
00:54:33.685 --> 00:54:35.394
You're not going to say anything?

505
00:54:35.395 --> 00:54:36.520
Are you working for her?

506
00:54:36.521 --> 00:54:38.397
- Get a therapist, Mr. Fischer.
- What?

507
00:54:38.398 --> 00:54:43.398
It's from the heart.

508
00:54:54.748 --> 00:54:56.832
I'll talk to you later,
someone's here.

509
00:54:56.833 --> 00:54:58.876
A kiss.

510
00:54:58.877 --> 00:55:00.627
Hello.

511
00:55:00.628 --> 00:55:05.299
I'm Simén Fischer,
I spoke with Mr. Ederer's secretary.

512
00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:06.550
I'm supposed to leave my CV.

513
00:55:06.551 --> 00:55:08.594
Sure, I'll give it to her.

514
00:55:08.595 --> 00:55:11.680
I'd rather give it to her personally,

515
00:55:11.681 --> 00:55:15.559
and if Mr. Ederer's here,
I'd like to have a word with him.

516
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.644
I worked for over ten years

517
00:55:17.645 --> 00:55:20.314
at Seijas Raffo Martinez and Associates.

518
00:55:20.315 --> 00:55:21.982
I'm not a rookie.

519
00:55:21.983 --> 00:55:23.984
The engineer is on a construction site.

520
00:55:23.985 --> 00:55:25.110
And his secretary?

521
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:28.447
She's out for lunch.

522
00:55:28.448 --> 00:55:30.783
It's 4 pm.

523
00:55:30.784 --> 00:55:32.951
I don't handle her schedule.

524
00:55:32.952 --> 00:55:34.411
You know what?

525
00:55:34.412 --> 00:55:37.080
I won't leave a damn thing.

526
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:41.001
You can all go fuck yourselves:
you, Ederer and his secretary.

527
00:55:41.002 --> 00:55:45.380
Especially his secretary.
Go fuck yourselves.

528
00:55:45.381 --> 00:55:50.381
Lunch at 4 pm?
They must think I'm an idiot!

529
00:56:00.772 --> 00:56:05.772
The blue Chevrolet?

530
00:59:15.883 --> 00:59:17.676
You're rude.

531
00:59:17.677 --> 00:59:20.178
This is a fascist regime.

532
00:59:20.179 --> 00:59:22.097
I have to pay first and complain later?

533
00:59:22.098 --> 00:59:23.348
Exactly.

534
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:28.349
You won't stop until a tragedy occurs.

535
00:59:42.285 --> 00:59:47.164
"An act of terrorism,"
according to the official version.

536
00:59:47.165 --> 00:59:49.541
The defense claims it was an accident.

537
00:59:49.542 --> 00:59:53.128
"The engineer worked with explosives,

538
00:59:53.129 --> 00:59:56.923
"and the tow truck movement
caused the explosion."

539
00:59:56.924 --> 00:59:58.425
The prosecutor responds:

540
00:59:58.426 --> 01:00:01.636
"The fact there were no victims
proves the engineer

541
01:00:01.637 --> 01:00:04.389
"meticulously calculated
the explosion range."

542
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:07.017
This is the 4th time
my car's been towed.

543
01:00:07.018 --> 01:00:08.977
Help me Dynamite!

544
01:00:08.978 --> 01:00:11.354
Please Dynamite:
Blow up the tax office!

545
01:00:11.355 --> 01:00:14.399
Insurance company refuses to pay:

546
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.570
"The tow truck company's responsible
for the damages."

547
01:00:18.571 --> 01:00:23.571
There are questions about the tow truck
company's concession.

548
01:00:24.118 --> 01:00:25.827
On social networks,

549
01:00:25.828 --> 01:00:30.828
thousands demand the release
of the engineer known as "Dynamite."

550
01:00:33.252 --> 01:00:38.252
Thank you.

551
01:00:43.596 --> 01:00:48.596
Happy birthday, Dynamite...

552
01:02:14.395 --> 01:02:19.395
Dad.

553
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:26.615
What happened?

554
01:02:26.616 --> 01:02:29.117
What happened, Santiago?

555
01:02:29.118 --> 01:02:34.118
Say something!

556
01:02:59.357 --> 01:03:01.483
Promise me he won't go to jail.

557
01:03:01.484 --> 01:03:05.612
We'll do everything we can.

558
01:03:05.613 --> 01:03:09.908
We reiterate: right on Libertador Avenue,

559
01:03:09.909 --> 01:03:13.495
a driver struck a pregnant woman
and drove off.

560
01:03:13.496 --> 01:03:16.581
The driver did not stop
to help the victim...

561
01:03:16.582 --> 01:03:19.417
Santiago, tell me the truth.

562
01:03:19.418 --> 01:03:20.669
Were you drinking?

563
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:22.671
Did you smoke pot'?

564
01:03:22.672 --> 01:03:25.507
The eye witnesses couldn't identify

565
01:03:25.508 --> 01:03:28.802
the car brand nor the license plate.

566
01:03:28.803 --> 01:03:33.803
As we speak, the police is
analyzing security camera footage

567
01:03:34.016 --> 01:03:38.603
in order to identify the vehicle's owner.

568
01:03:38.604 --> 01:03:40.897
Hit and run.

569
01:03:40.898 --> 01:03:45.898
Another murderer behind the wheel...

570
01:03:46.779 --> 01:03:48.280
Who's the car registered to?

571
01:03:48.281 --> 01:03:49.948
It's in my name.

572
01:03:49.949 --> 01:03:51.908
- And this is the registered address?
- Yes.

573
01:03:51.909 --> 01:03:53.618
What have I done?

574
01:03:53.619 --> 01:03:56.746
What have you done'?
You ruined our life, you asshole!

575
01:03:56.747 --> 01:03:58.707
Help him, Mauricio, please!

576
01:03:58.708 --> 01:04:00.625
Get him out.

577
01:04:00.626 --> 01:04:04.587
Santiago, listen,
I need to ask you some questions.

578
01:04:04.588 --> 01:04:07.507
Look at me.

579
01:04:07.508 --> 01:04:12.508
Was anyone else in the car?

580
01:04:12.555 --> 01:04:14.723
Did you tell anyone what happened?

581
01:04:14.724 --> 01:04:16.850
No.

582
01:04:16.851 --> 01:04:20.937
Let's take a look at the car.

583
01:04:20.938 --> 01:04:25.938
The windows are tinted.

584
01:04:25.985 --> 01:04:29.279
Were they closed?

585
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.739
I think so.

586
01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.075
- Try to remember.
- Yes.

587
01:04:34.076 --> 01:04:36.453
Did you get out of the car
to see what happened

588
01:04:36.454 --> 01:04:38.371
or did you keep driving?

589
01:04:38.372 --> 01:04:40.248
I kept driving.

590
01:04:40.249 --> 01:04:43.918
Where were you coming from?

591
01:04:43.919 --> 01:04:45.754
A bar downtown.

592
01:04:45.755 --> 01:04:48.548
Did anyone see you arrive
or leave in the car?

593
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:51.134
Your friends, a girl?

594
01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:56.135
I swear I can't remember.

595
01:04:56.474 --> 01:04:59.976
Unfortunately,
we have just been informed

596
01:04:59.977 --> 01:05:03.396
that in the ambulance
heading to the hospital

597
01:05:03.397 --> 01:05:08.397
both the woman
and her unborn child passed away.

598
01:05:08.986 --> 01:05:11.571
Police is still gathering information

599
01:05:11.572 --> 01:05:14.824
through footage from security cameras

600
01:05:14.825 --> 01:05:19.825
and interrogating witnesses...

601
01:05:52.071 --> 01:05:57.071
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

602
01:06:01.539 --> 01:06:06.539
I'm really embarrassed to have
to make this proposition...

603
01:06:07.378 --> 01:06:12.378
but we've known each other for years

604
01:06:12.591 --> 01:06:17.591
and I feel we have this kind of bond.

605
01:06:17.638 --> 01:06:19.431
Besides,

606
01:06:19.432 --> 01:06:24.060
you're a father,
I know you want the best for your kids...

607
01:06:24.061 --> 01:06:26.729
So I think this arrangement

608
01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:31.730
may be good for you too.

609
01:06:32.236 --> 01:06:37.236
If you say you took the car for a drive

610
01:06:37.783 --> 01:06:41.911
last night while we were sleeping...

611
01:06:41.912 --> 01:06:46.583
and that you were driving
at the time of the accident,

612
01:06:46.584 --> 01:06:49.919
I'll hire the best lawyer

613
01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.840
to get you the shortest sentence
possible...

614
01:06:53.841 --> 01:06:57.135
With good behavior,
you'll be out in a year and a half.

615
01:06:57.136 --> 01:06:59.971
- Is that right?
- That's right.

616
01:06:59.972 --> 01:07:01.598
Good.

617
01:07:01.599 --> 01:07:04.851
And for doing me that huge favor,

618
01:07:04.852 --> 01:07:09.314
I'll pay you 500,000 dollars.

619
01:07:09.315 --> 01:07:13.234
You wouldn't earn that in a lifetime.

620
01:07:13.235 --> 01:07:18.031
And your family will be set for life.

621
01:07:18.032 --> 01:07:21.784
You know Santiago...

622
01:07:21.785 --> 01:07:25.371
He wouldn't survive in prison.

623
01:07:25.372 --> 01:07:30.372
He couldn't stand it.

624
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.518
José“.

625
01:07:46.519 --> 01:07:51.356
Please, sit in the car.

626
01:07:51.357 --> 01:07:54.567
Grab the wheel with both hands.

627
01:07:54.568 --> 01:07:59.568
Touch it everywhere.

628
01:07:59.615 --> 01:08:00.990
Good.

629
01:08:00.991 --> 01:08:03.368
You'd had some whiskey.

630
01:08:03.369 --> 01:08:04.953
Your bosses were sleeping.

631
01:08:04.954 --> 01:08:07.205
As you parked the car, like every night,

632
01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:09.749
you felt like going for a ride.

633
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:14.750
If they'd asked, you'd have said
the tires needed air.

634
01:08:14.755 --> 01:08:18.091
Then you bumped into something

635
01:08:18.092 --> 01:08:21.010
and you can't remember anything
after that

636
01:08:21.011 --> 01:08:26.011
until you woke up in here.

637
01:08:27.393 --> 01:08:28.768
José,

638
01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:31.020
I can't thank you enough.

639
01:08:31.021 --> 01:08:32.730
Don't touch him, please.

640
01:08:32.731 --> 01:08:37.731
It's alright, ma'am.

641
01:08:41.949 --> 01:08:44.993
Excuse me.

642
01:08:44.994 --> 01:08:48.788
I've been thinking and...
I don't know...

643
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:52.041
I'd like to discuss it with my wife.

644
01:08:52.042 --> 01:08:55.378
She can't know about it.
At least not now.

645
01:08:55.379 --> 01:08:57.380
We can't take the risk.

646
01:08:57.381 --> 01:08:59.173
What if she talks'?
Think about it.

647
01:08:59.174 --> 01:09:00.717
You end up with no deal

648
01:09:00.718 --> 01:09:03.636
and you'd go to prison for perjury.

649
01:09:03.637 --> 01:09:04.971
Fine.

650
01:09:04.972 --> 01:09:08.224
Honey...

651
01:09:08.225 --> 01:09:11.561
Well, then.

652
01:09:11.562 --> 01:09:15.315
You two take my van
and go to the country house.

653
01:09:15.316 --> 01:09:17.233
When you drive by a toll booth,
look down.

654
01:09:17.234 --> 01:09:20.987
Don't stop at gas stations,
if you want to buy something,

655
01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:25.658
pay cash, don't use your credit card.

656
01:09:25.659 --> 01:09:30.659
Come on.

657
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:37.041
Let's go!

658
01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:39.964
Get in the car again, please.

659
01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:43.176
He should sit in the back.

660
01:09:43.177 --> 01:09:48.177
Bring the seat forward.

661
01:09:50.893 --> 01:09:54.562
You two go upstairs
and go to sleep.

662
01:09:54.563 --> 01:09:59.563
You don't know anything, okay?

663
01:10:00.444 --> 01:10:01.819
You calm down

664
01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.820
and keep quiet.
I'll take care of this.

665
01:10:17.586 --> 01:10:22.173
That's okay.

666
01:10:22.174 --> 01:10:25.051
- Mauricio Pereyra?
- I'm his attorney.

667
01:10:25.052 --> 01:10:26.719
I was about to call the police.

668
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.889
Come in, please.
Such an awful tragedy!

669
01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:33.434
An hour ago,
my client heard noises downstairs.

670
01:10:33.435 --> 01:10:35.937
He thought someone had broken in.

671
01:10:35.938 --> 01:10:40.900
He went into the garage
and found the groundskeeper

672
01:10:40.901 --> 01:10:44.278
sitting in his car, drunk,
in a state of shock.

673
01:10:44.279 --> 01:10:48.783
Then he heard the news, he put two
and two together and he called me.

674
01:10:48.784 --> 01:10:53.784
Mauricio Pereyra,
this is the prosecutor on duty.

675
01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:56.958
And this is José.

676
01:10:56.959 --> 01:11:01.959
He's worked for the family for what?
15 years?

677
01:11:02.548 --> 01:11:06.050
Now we're going to speak
to the victim's husband.

678
01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:07.677
The father of the unborn child...

679
01:11:07.678 --> 01:11:10.847
Sir, what do you have to say?

680
01:11:10.848 --> 01:11:13.307
What do I have to say?
What do you think?

681
01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:17.186
Turn that off, it's not necessary.

682
01:11:17.187 --> 01:11:18.980
I've got one thing to say.

683
01:11:18.981 --> 01:11:22.108
Whoever did this is going to pay.

684
01:11:22.109 --> 01:11:24.110
Are you listening?

685
01:11:24.111 --> 01:11:27.155
No matter where you hide,
I'm going to...

686
01:11:27.156 --> 01:11:30.032
Very well. What happened, José?

687
01:11:30.033 --> 01:11:30.908
Excuse me.

688
01:11:30.909 --> 01:11:33.703
José,
you have the right to remain silent.

689
01:11:33.704 --> 01:11:37.457
I'll be representing Mr. Torres
at my client's request.

690
01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:42.458
He has never had any trouble
with the law and he's the father of two.

691
01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:48.255
Can you tell me about the accident?

692
01:11:48.552 --> 01:11:52.555
I always park Mr. Mauricio's car.

693
01:11:52.556 --> 01:11:56.017
I wanted to take the new one for a ride,

694
01:11:56.018 --> 01:11:59.228
to take the Beemer for a spin.

695
01:11:59.229 --> 01:12:01.230
And last night...

696
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:03.941
I'd been drinking.

697
01:12:03.942 --> 01:12:06.444
And I went for it.

698
01:12:06.445 --> 01:12:09.947
I never thought something
like this could happen.

699
01:12:09.948 --> 01:12:13.493
I went down Libertador Avenue

700
01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:17.455
and I sped up.
I was driving really fast.

701
01:12:17.456 --> 01:12:20.124
And I bumped into something,
I couldn't tell what it was.

702
01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:21.667
It was a blur.

703
01:12:21.668 --> 01:12:22.835
I thought it was a dog.

704
01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:26.464
I heard a loud thud...

705
01:12:26.465 --> 01:12:28.132
And I got scared

706
01:12:28.133 --> 01:12:31.302
because I thought I'd dented the car.

707
01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:33.846
I wanted to return and try to fix it

708
01:12:33.847 --> 01:12:38.847
before Mr. Mauricio woke up.

709
01:13:03.502 --> 01:13:08.502
May I?

710
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:40.450
Jose, can you please sit
in the driver's seat?

711
01:13:48.547 --> 01:13:53.547
- Should I touch it?
- Yes, grab the wheel.

712
01:13:54.428 --> 01:13:59.428
Sit back.

713
01:14:02.394 --> 01:14:07.394
Could you shut the door?

714
01:14:16.783 --> 01:14:20.161
Do you use the rear view mirrors
when you drive?

715
01:14:20.162 --> 01:14:21.996
The mirrors?
Yes, of course I do.

716
01:14:21.997 --> 01:14:24.624
Because in this position,
you can only see the roof.

717
01:14:24.625 --> 01:14:27.835
It's a miracle
you only ran over one person.

718
01:14:27.836 --> 01:14:31.005
They must have moved
during the crash.

719
01:14:31.006 --> 01:14:34.133
All at the same time?

720
01:14:34.134 --> 01:14:37.929
Yes...

721
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:42.516
I think this car was driven
by someone much taller than you.

722
01:14:42.517 --> 01:14:45.269
Does anyone else live in the house?

723
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:47.229
My wife, my son...

724
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:49.398
my dog.

725
01:14:49.399 --> 01:14:50.983
No need to wake up the dog,

726
01:14:50.984 --> 01:14:53.861
but I'd like to meet
your wife and son.

727
01:14:53.862 --> 01:14:58.862
Sure, no problem.
We'll ask them to come down.

728
01:14:58.909 --> 01:15:03.909
Do I have your permission
to start negotiating?

729
01:16:18.447 --> 01:16:19.739
Is it that bad?

730
01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.450
No, everything's fine.

731
01:16:22.451 --> 01:16:26.370
He's willing to make a deal,
but it's going to be expensive.

732
01:16:26.371 --> 01:16:27.663
How expensive?

733
01:16:27.664 --> 01:16:28.664
One million.

734
01:16:28.665 --> 01:16:29.790
Dollars?

735
01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:33.836
He saw your house, the way you live.
He won't take less than that.

736
01:16:33.837 --> 01:16:35.546
The good news is
he'll take care of everything.

737
01:16:35.547 --> 01:16:38.507
He knows the police chief,
most of the judges

738
01:16:38.508 --> 01:16:40.509
and he'll help us reinforce the alibi.

739
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:43.804
The groundskeeper's?
Can't we leave him out?

740
01:16:43.805 --> 01:16:45.931
Somebody's got to be responsible.

741
01:16:45.932 --> 01:16:47.850
Two people are dead,
it was all over the news.

742
01:16:47.851 --> 01:16:50.352
Fine, but I don't know
if I have that much cash.

743
01:16:50.353 --> 01:16:51.479
It's 1.5 million dollars!

744
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.939
And there's my cut too.

745
01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.357
Your cut?

746
01:16:55.358 --> 01:16:58.319
Of course.
I'm the one negotiating all this.

747
01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.988
I pay your firm a fortune every year!

748
01:17:00.989 --> 01:17:05.989
This is different.
These are not fees.

749
01:17:06.411 --> 01:17:08.829
I'm putting my name on the line.

750
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:13.292
I was about to lend you my oar
so your wife and son could make a getaway.

751
01:17:13.293 --> 01:17:15.044
You're not being fair.

752
01:17:15.045 --> 01:17:17.129
How much are we talking about?

753
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:21.050
I don't know.
Half a million?

754
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:24.178
Look, if you'd like to call
another lawyer,

755
01:17:24.179 --> 01:17:29.179
that's fine by me,
my work ends here.

756
01:17:29.392 --> 01:17:34.392
Go and close the deal.

757
01:17:52.165 --> 01:17:53.958
Is everything okay, José?

758
01:17:53.959 --> 01:17:55.876
Well, not really.

759
01:17:55.877 --> 01:17:56.919
Why not?

760
01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:00.798
For going to prison,
I'm getting the same as your lawyer?

761
01:18:00.799 --> 01:18:02.675
I know I'm poor, but...

762
01:18:02.676 --> 01:18:05.970
- What you're doing is awful.
- Awful?

763
01:18:05.971 --> 01:18:08.305
Then you go to prison.

764
01:18:08.306 --> 01:18:10.975
Last night I watched a Western,
had a cup of tea

765
01:18:10.976 --> 01:18:13.602
and went to bed early.

766
01:18:13.603 --> 01:18:18.190
What else do you want, José?
Be clear, time is running out.

767
01:18:18.191 --> 01:18:20.776
The money we agreed on...

768
01:18:20.777 --> 01:18:24.196
<i>and an apartment 'm Mar de m.</i>

769
01:18:24.197 --> 01:18:25.656
Mauricio, José.

770
01:18:25.657 --> 01:18:30.657
Can we all talk?

771
01:18:31.329 --> 01:18:36.329
Justice, justice!

772
01:18:37.294 --> 01:18:40.087
Let's get to the point, gentlemen,
time is of the essence,

773
01:18:40.088 --> 01:18:42.131
there's no room
for misunderstandings.

774
01:18:42.132 --> 01:18:45.301
The story stays the same.

775
01:18:45.302 --> 01:18:48.512
I'm going to need you
and your family to testify,

776
01:18:48.513 --> 01:18:50.014
so no one leaves town.

777
01:18:50.015 --> 01:18:53.225
You'll leave the house in cuffs,
with a hood on.

778
01:18:53.226 --> 01:18:55.853
Outside there'll be press
and angry people,

779
01:18:55.854 --> 01:18:59.190
they'll ask you questions,
call you names, don't say a word.

780
01:18:59.191 --> 01:19:02.693
We avoid controversy,
let the trial move along,

781
01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:05.738
get a conviction and everyone's happy.

782
01:19:05.739 --> 01:19:09.033
Stop, mom! It's my life!

783
01:19:09.034 --> 01:19:11.368
He wants to go out there and confess...

784
01:19:11.369 --> 01:19:12.745
It's the right thing to do!

785
01:19:12.746 --> 01:19:15.122
Say something,
he has no idea what he's doing!

786
01:19:15.123 --> 01:19:17.041
Santiago, calm down...

787
01:19:17.042 --> 01:19:18.375
Your mom is right,

788
01:19:18.376 --> 01:19:20.127
we'll fix this.

789
01:19:20.128 --> 01:19:23.756
Can you shut the door
and take care of Santiago, please?

790
01:19:23.757 --> 01:19:25.007
Let's go!

791
01:19:25.008 --> 01:19:29.678
<i>Cam down, San“.</i>

792
01:19:29.679 --> 01:19:32.556
Can we proceed?

793
01:19:32.557 --> 01:19:35.267
From now on, you'll be the middle man.

794
01:19:35.268 --> 01:19:38.520
I won't talk to Mr. Pereyra again
until he testifies in court.

795
01:19:38.521 --> 01:19:42.399
And you, José, avoid talking
to anyone except your lawyer.

796
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.567
Perfect.

797
01:19:43.568 --> 01:19:46.237
I'll need some cash
for operational expenses,

798
01:19:46.238 --> 01:19:47.780
let's say 30,000 dollars.

799
01:19:47.781 --> 01:19:49.698
I'll need it first thing on Monday.

800
01:19:49.699 --> 01:19:52.868
Just one question.

801
01:19:52.869 --> 01:19:55.746
What do you mean
by operational expenses?

802
01:19:55.747 --> 01:19:58.207
There are officers outside,
the police chief is there.

803
01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:02.378
If someone saw or heard anything,
we need to cut them in.

804
01:20:02.379 --> 01:20:05.339
We have to avoid loose ends.

805
01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.674
So if you're OK...

806
01:20:06.675 --> 01:20:09.176
You'll have the money on Monday,

807
01:20:09.177 --> 01:20:11.971
but it's coming out
of the budget we agreed on,

808
01:20:11.972 --> 01:20:13.555
I won't pay one more penny.

809
01:20:13.556 --> 01:20:16.517
- Mauricio, please.
- Yes, please...

810
01:20:16.518 --> 01:20:19.478
That's what I say. Please!

811
01:20:19.479 --> 01:20:21.855
I know I'm in a rough spot,

812
01:20:21.856 --> 01:20:24.233
but I won't be gutted like this.

813
01:20:24.234 --> 01:20:27.987
What the prosecutor
is saying is reasonable.

814
01:20:27.988 --> 01:20:31.198
Let's not argue over 30,000 dollars.

815
01:20:31.199 --> 01:20:36.199
You pay it then.
Take it out of your share.

816
01:20:37.247 --> 01:20:39.373
Gentlemen, there's no time for arguing.

817
01:20:39.374 --> 01:20:41.375
If you want to proceed
we have to do it now.

818
01:20:41.376 --> 01:20:42.543
Then you Pa)! it-

819
01:20:42.544 --> 01:20:44.545
You're getting 1 million dollars

820
01:20:44.546 --> 01:20:47.464
and you want an extra
30,000 for contingencies?

821
01:20:47.465 --> 01:20:52.465
Who's getting a million?

822
01:20:54.931 --> 01:20:56.849
He's right.

823
01:20:56.850 --> 01:21:00.185
The million includes contingencies.

824
01:21:00.186 --> 01:21:03.814
Your cut plus the 30,000 add up
to a million dollars.

825
01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:08.068
Don't touch my cut.

826
01:21:08.069 --> 01:21:10.612
You know what, guys?

827
01:21:10.613 --> 01:21:14.241
It's over. The deal is off.

828
01:21:14.242 --> 01:21:15.701
What do you mean it's off'?

829
01:21:15.702 --> 01:21:17.953
It's off!

830
01:21:17.954 --> 01:21:20.247
It's over! No one gets anything!

831
01:21:20.248 --> 01:21:21.957
No more!

832
01:21:21.958 --> 01:21:24.501
Santiago!

833
01:21:24.502 --> 01:21:26.920
You said you wanted to confess?

834
01:21:26.921 --> 01:21:29.548
That's perfect.
Go out there and talk.

835
01:21:29.549 --> 01:21:31.467
I gave you the best education

836
01:21:31.468 --> 01:21:33.844
and you always did
whatever you wanted.

837
01:21:33.845 --> 01:21:38.845
So now, go screw yourself!

838
01:21:40.101 --> 01:21:41.185
Calm down.

839
01:21:41.186 --> 01:21:43.062
Can we be reasonable?

840
01:21:43.063 --> 01:21:45.272
What happened?

841
01:21:45.273 --> 01:21:48.108
They're all vultures!
That's what happened!

842
01:21:48.109 --> 01:21:53.109
But it's over.
I didn't kill anyone!

843
01:21:53.406 --> 01:21:56.033
...the house of the alleged murderer
right here in San Isidro.

844
01:21:56.034 --> 01:22:01.034
This morning there was
an accident on Libertador Avenue...

845
01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:32.190
Open the door.
I have something important to tell you.

846
01:22:32.821 --> 01:22:36.115
Can we talk in a civilized manner'?

847
01:22:36.116 --> 01:22:37.241
What?

848
01:22:37.242 --> 01:22:38.826
It's settled, we have an agreement.

849
01:22:38.827 --> 01:22:41.120
The 30,000 dollars will come
out of everyone's share.

850
01:22:41.121 --> 01:22:43.288
I don't want to hear about it!
It's over!

851
01:22:43.289 --> 01:22:45.165
Get out of my house!

852
01:22:45.166 --> 01:22:47.584
Let me remind you
two people are dead.

853
01:22:47.585 --> 01:22:49.545
If Santiago is found guilty,

854
01:22:49.546 --> 01:22:52.005
it will cost us much more.

855
01:22:52.006 --> 01:22:54.383
José, on the other hand, is penniless.

856
01:22:54.384 --> 01:22:57.553
Right, so who will compensate
the victim's family?

857
01:22:57.554 --> 01:23:00.472
The money should go to them,
that's the right thing to do.

858
01:23:00.473 --> 01:23:03.183
That scumbag earns a salary
that comes out of my taxes?

859
01:23:03.184 --> 01:23:04.810
He should investigate what happened!

860
01:23:04.811 --> 01:23:07.354
You want to represent my son?
Discuss your fees with him!

861
01:23:07.355 --> 01:23:09.481
If he can pay,
it's between you two.

862
01:23:09.482 --> 01:23:11.108
Do what you have to do!

863
01:23:11.109 --> 01:23:12.818
Do your job!

864
01:23:12.819 --> 01:23:14.611
We had a deal,

865
01:23:14.612 --> 01:23:18.073
it's not honorable to back out.

866
01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:19.992
I'm sorry if I offended you,

867
01:23:19.993 --> 01:23:24.079
but I've always defended
your family's interests.

868
01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.080
I thank you with all my heart!
You're an angel!

869
01:23:37.093 --> 01:23:38.927
Can I talk to them

870
01:23:38.928 --> 01:23:43.928
to see if I can improve the terms?

871
01:23:44.726 --> 01:23:49.146
Excuse me.

872
01:23:49.147 --> 01:23:50.439
Listen,

873
01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:53.567
I think we have
a better deal to offer you.

874
01:23:53.568 --> 01:23:56.487
José takes the initial 500,000

875
01:23:56.488 --> 01:23:59.698
and says forget about
the apartment on the beach.

876
01:23:59.699 --> 01:24:02.117
The prosecutor and I
split the million.

877
01:24:02.118 --> 01:24:03.577
Not one penny more.

878
01:24:03.578 --> 01:24:05.162
But we have to do it now,
Mauricio.

879
01:24:05.163 --> 01:24:08.707
The press is outside
and the prosecutor needs

880
01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:12.878
to let the police chief
into the house.

881
01:24:12.879 --> 01:24:14.838
No!

882
01:24:14.839 --> 01:24:17.466
I'll put up a total of one million

883
01:24:17.467 --> 01:24:19.468
and you split it any way you want.

884
01:24:19.469 --> 01:24:22.554
- What do you mean, one million?
- Take it or leave it!

885
01:24:22.555 --> 01:24:24.890
If you don't like it, get lost!

886
01:24:24.891 --> 01:24:27.017
You come back here with
any other proposal

887
01:24:27.018 --> 01:24:29.061
and I'll press charges against
you for extortion.

888
01:24:29.062 --> 01:24:34.062
Against you and the prosecutor!

889
01:24:35.527 --> 01:24:37.736
Prosecutor, can you reveal
the identity of the suspect?

890
01:24:37.737 --> 01:24:39.279
I can't give any details right now,

891
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.199
but the case is virtually closed.

892
01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.408
There's only one suspect

893
01:24:43.409 --> 01:24:45.786
and I'm about to present
the brief to the judge.

894
01:24:45.787 --> 01:24:48.288
Thank you.

895
01:24:48.289 --> 01:24:53.289
Justice, justice!

896
01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:59.420
Watch out!

897
01:25:31.499 --> 01:25:36.499
Always showing some skin, Bocha!

898
01:25:44.053 --> 01:25:46.263
And now...

899
01:25:46.264 --> 01:25:49.558
it's time we all stand up

900
01:25:49.559 --> 01:25:52.477
and give a big hand

901
01:25:52.478 --> 01:25:55.022
to welcome our dear...

902
01:25:55.023 --> 01:26:00.023
Romina and Ariel!

903
01:26:35.104 --> 01:26:40.067
Let me hug my father-in-law!

904
01:26:40.068 --> 01:26:41.735
Take good care of her.

905
01:26:41.736 --> 01:26:46.736
I'll be watching.

906
01:26:48.576 --> 01:26:51.828
Thank you!

907
01:26:51.829 --> 01:26:56.829
I gave him a few good tips...

908
01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:13.781
Long live the newly weds!

909
01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:27.170
Everyone look this way.

910
01:28:30.303 --> 01:28:33.013
A big smile!

911
01:28:33.014 --> 01:28:36.016
Thank you very much.

912
01:28:36.017 --> 01:28:37.225
Thanks!

913
01:28:37.226 --> 01:28:39.436
Thank you.

914
01:28:39.437 --> 01:28:42.105
Enjoy.

915
01:28:42.106 --> 01:28:45.984
Romina.

916
01:28:45.985 --> 01:28:49.029
This is a little something for you.

917
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:52.616
You shouldn't have.

918
01:28:52.617 --> 01:28:55.118
You being here is gift enough.

919
01:28:55.119 --> 01:28:56.328
Are you having a good time?

920
01:28:56.329 --> 01:28:59.748
Lovely.
You're so beautiful!

921
01:28:59.749 --> 01:29:02.083
Your family is so nice.

922
01:29:02.084 --> 01:29:05.337
Too bad this country is so unsafe.

923
01:29:05.338 --> 01:29:08.924
Roni's wallet was stolen last night
and he didn't even realize it.

924
01:29:08.925 --> 01:29:10.634
That's horrible!

925
01:29:10.635 --> 01:29:11.968
How awful!

926
01:29:11.969 --> 01:29:14.095
Yes, things are bad now,

927
01:29:14.096 --> 01:29:16.515
but little by little...

928
01:29:16.516 --> 01:29:20.685
So many beautiful people.
All friends of yours?

929
01:29:20.686 --> 01:29:24.356
Well, those are our friends
from the country club.

930
01:29:24.357 --> 01:29:26.107
We hadn't seen each other
since we were 13,

931
01:29:26.108 --> 01:29:28.777
but with Facebook and all,
we got back in touch.

932
01:29:28.778 --> 01:29:31.071
Facebook!

933
01:29:31.072 --> 01:29:33.490
Those back there
are my college friends

934
01:29:33.491 --> 01:29:35.283
with their boyfriends.

935
01:29:35.284 --> 01:29:38.119
Well, the ones who have boyfriends.

936
01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.621
Those are...

937
01:29:39.622 --> 01:29:44.622
Ariel's co-workers...

938
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:46.670
Are you having a good time?

939
01:29:46.671 --> 01:29:49.756
- Yes. Are you?
- Good...

940
01:29:49.757 --> 01:29:53.635
Your typical wedding.

941
01:29:53.636 --> 01:29:58.431
You're something, you know?

942
01:29:58.432 --> 01:29:59.766
Enjoy.

943
01:29:59.767 --> 01:30:04.767
You too.

944
01:30:04.772 --> 01:30:06.940
Do you know any good place

945
01:30:06.941 --> 01:30:09.317
for us to learn the tango?

946
01:30:09.318 --> 01:30:13.029
Yes! No... Not me.
But I know my cousin would.

947
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:18.030
I'll introduce you.

948
01:31:16.928 --> 01:31:18.803
Fuck! I don't...

949
01:31:18.804 --> 01:31:21.139
What is it?

950
01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.141
No more wine for you.

951
01:31:23.142 --> 01:31:28.142
No, don't do that.
Act like you're talking to me.

952
01:32:18.823 --> 01:32:22.242
Ariel, who's that girl
with the long hair?

953
01:32:22.243 --> 01:32:23.284
Which one?

954
01:32:23.285 --> 01:32:28.285
That one over there.
Your co-worker.

955
01:32:30.042 --> 01:32:32.293
Lourdes.

956
01:32:32.294 --> 01:32:34.462
Why?

957
01:32:34.463 --> 01:32:38.216
No reason.

958
01:32:38.217 --> 01:32:42.470
And how does Lourdes know
your guitar teacher?

959
01:32:42.471 --> 01:32:46.057
My guitar teacher?

960
01:32:46.058 --> 01:32:48.268
A few months ago
someone called your phone

961
01:32:48.269 --> 01:32:52.647
when I answered, they hung up.
You said it was your guitar teacher.

962
01:32:52.648 --> 01:32:54.816
It seemed weird, so I saved the number.

963
01:32:54.817 --> 01:32:59.817
And now I call and Lourdes picks up.

964
01:32:59.947 --> 01:33:01.948
I don't know what you're talking about.

965
01:33:01.949 --> 01:33:04.034
You don't know?

966
01:33:04.035 --> 01:33:08.872
With all the cell phone companies
and special deals out there,

967
01:33:08.873 --> 01:33:13.209
this girl just happened to buy
your guitar teacher's phone line?

968
01:33:13.210 --> 01:33:15.503
Especially if you never
introduced them.

969
01:33:15.504 --> 01:33:19.758
Isn't it an amazing coincidence?

970
01:33:19.759 --> 01:33:21.760
- So?
- What?

971
01:33:21.761 --> 01:33:24.345
Answer me or I'll ask her myself.

972
01:33:24.346 --> 01:33:26.264
- Romi, please, don't.
- Don't "Romi" me!

973
01:33:26.265 --> 01:33:29.517
Answer my question!

974
01:33:29.518 --> 01:33:34.518
Ariel, does everyone at table 27
know that you fucked that girl?

975
01:33:34.815 --> 01:33:39.402
Did you invite all those jerks
to our wedding? How could you?

976
01:33:39.403 --> 01:33:41.237
I'm sorry to interrupt.

977
01:33:41.238 --> 01:33:43.948
May I have this dance
with the prince?

978
01:33:43.949 --> 01:33:46.284
Of course, my queen.

979
01:33:46.285 --> 01:33:51.285
Here's your prince.

980
01:33:52.958 --> 01:33:54.375
What happened?

981
01:33:54.376 --> 01:33:59.376
Nothing.

982
01:34:05.012 --> 01:34:09.891
Romi, are you okay?

983
01:34:09.892 --> 01:34:12.268
What is it?

984
01:34:12.269 --> 01:34:17.269
Just a moment.

985
01:34:18.484 --> 01:34:23.484
Bocha, can I have a minute?

986
01:34:32.081 --> 01:34:34.958
Honey.

987
01:34:34.959 --> 01:34:39.959
Baby, stop it.
Let's enjoy our wedding.

988
01:34:40.422 --> 01:34:45.422
Did you sleep with that girl?

989
01:34:45.928 --> 01:34:48.388
Please, tell me the truth,

990
01:34:48.389 --> 01:34:53.389
I need to know.

991
01:34:55.771 --> 01:34:59.524
Yes, baby.

992
01:34:59.525 --> 01:35:03.611
But it didn't mean anything to me,
I swear.

993
01:35:03.612 --> 01:35:06.281
Romi, please,
let's not make a scene here.

994
01:35:06.282 --> 01:35:08.032
- It was a mistake.
- Let me go!

995
01:35:08.033 --> 01:35:09.659
I'm sorry! Really, I made a mistake.

996
01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:14.660
I want to be alone!

997
01:36:01.003 --> 01:36:02.003
What was that?

998
01:36:02.004 --> 01:36:07.004
- Did you see her?
- You're asking me'?

999
01:36:22.983 --> 01:36:27.983
Everything Okay?

1000
01:36:29.073 --> 01:36:34.073
Shall I get somebody?

1001
01:36:35.579 --> 01:36:40.083
Are you all right'?

1002
01:36:40.084 --> 01:36:43.586
Clearly you're not all right.

1003
01:36:43.587 --> 01:36:46.297
Calm down.
What happened?

1004
01:36:46.298 --> 01:36:49.550
I just found out my husband
cheated on me

1005
01:36:49.551 --> 01:36:51.511
with one of our wedding guests.

1006
01:36:51.512 --> 01:36:53.888
That's awful.

1007
01:36:53.889 --> 01:36:56.933
And now I don't know what to do

1008
01:36:56.934 --> 01:37:00.186
with all those people down there.

1009
01:37:00.187 --> 01:37:02.814
Calm down, these things happen...

1010
01:37:02.815 --> 01:37:04.357
Time heals all wounds.

1011
01:37:04.358 --> 01:37:09.358
Here.

1012
01:37:09.405 --> 01:37:12.448
If you love him,
you'll be able to forgive him.

1013
01:37:12.449 --> 01:37:17.449
- If he's the one for you...
- I don't know if I love him!

1014
01:37:18.205 --> 01:37:21.374
I don't know if he's the one for me...

1015
01:37:21.375 --> 01:37:23.251
He's an asshole!

1016
01:37:23.252 --> 01:37:24.752
Well, then...

1017
01:37:24.753 --> 01:37:27.171
To hell with him.

1018
01:37:27.172 --> 01:37:28.965
And don't worry about the guests,

1019
01:37:28.966 --> 01:37:31.759
you're not the first woman
at that party to be cheated on.

1020
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.635
Plus,

1021
01:37:32.636 --> 01:37:35.805
if you spend your time worrying
about what other people think

1022
01:37:35.806 --> 01:37:40.643
you're screwed, kiddo.

1023
01:37:40.644 --> 01:37:43.980
All better?

1024
01:37:43.981 --> 01:37:46.024
Look...

1025
01:37:46.025 --> 01:37:48.609
If I were you,
I'd go downstairs,

1026
01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:51.362
move the party along, end it early,

1027
01:37:51.363 --> 01:37:55.283
and then, back at home,
tell him it's over.

1028
01:37:55.284 --> 01:37:59.912
What happened to you is awful,
I won't deny it.

1029
01:37:59.913 --> 01:38:04.913
But you have to move on.

1030
01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:10.210
Better?

1031
01:39:21.912 --> 01:39:24.914
Romina?

1032
01:39:24.915 --> 01:39:28.584
Get the hell out of here!
Don't say a word!

1033
01:39:28.585 --> 01:39:31.671
You don't know
who you're messing with!

1034
01:39:31.672 --> 01:39:33.923
I'll take every penny you have,

1035
01:39:33.924 --> 01:39:37.009
every property your dad put
in your name

1036
01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:38.511
to get around taxes

1037
01:39:38.512 --> 01:39:39.720
will be mine.

1038
01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:41.264
We are married.

1039
01:39:41.265 --> 01:39:43.474
Legally married.

1040
01:39:43.475 --> 01:39:48.104
I'll spend all my days
sleeping with any man who looks my way

1041
01:39:48.105 --> 01:39:50.731
anyone who gives me
an ounce of love.

1042
01:39:50.732 --> 01:39:53.151
And when it's you
who wants the divorce,

1043
01:39:53.152 --> 01:39:54.861
I'll take acting lessons

1044
01:39:54.862 --> 01:39:57.613
so I can stand before the judge
like a sad little puppy

1045
01:39:57.614 --> 01:40:00.158
and tell him I'm fighting
to make this work,

1046
01:40:00.159 --> 01:40:03.286
that way our marriage
will last forever.

1047
01:40:03.287 --> 01:40:06.247
I'll post all your secrets on Facebook!

1048
01:40:06.248 --> 01:40:10.293
I'll torture you
until you scream with pain.

1049
01:40:10.294 --> 01:40:14.088
You'll be so humiliated
that your only way out

1050
01:40:14.089 --> 01:40:17.008
will be jumping off a bridge.

1051
01:40:17.009 --> 01:40:18.050
And then,

1052
01:40:18.051 --> 01:40:20.344
when death do us part,

1053
01:40:20.345 --> 01:40:25.345
when your death do us part,
I'll have it all.

1054
01:40:29.688 --> 01:40:31.564
Ariel, calm down.

1055
01:40:31.565 --> 01:40:36.565
Come on, buddy.

1056
01:40:54.505 --> 01:40:59.505
Where the hell have you been?

1057
01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:11.600
Stop!

1058
01:41:14.066 --> 01:41:15.274
Put me down!

1059
01:41:15.275 --> 01:41:18.152
Put me down, assholes!

1060
01:41:18.153 --> 01:41:23.153
Gustavo, tell them to let me down!

1061
01:41:23.325 --> 01:41:24.575
Something is wrong!

1062
01:41:24.576 --> 01:41:26.035
Can't you get them to
put me down!

1063
01:41:26.036 --> 01:41:26.953
I'm telling them!

1064
01:41:26.954 --> 01:41:29.121
Marianito! Turco!

1065
01:41:29.122 --> 01:41:30.248
Careful, boys.

1066
01:41:30.249 --> 01:41:35.249
Goddamn it, Comanche!

1067
01:41:36.755 --> 01:41:38.631
Stop it!

1068
01:41:38.632 --> 01:41:41.050
Assholes!

1069
01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:46.051
Assholes!

1070
01:42:43.905 --> 01:42:46.407
Leaving already?

1071
01:42:46.408 --> 01:42:49.785
No, no, stay.

1072
01:42:49.786 --> 01:42:54.786
We worked it out.
Really, don't worry, come with me.

1073
01:43:04.176 --> 01:43:06.135
Stop, I'm getting dizzy!

1074
01:43:06.136 --> 01:43:09.263
Relax, this is great!

1075
01:43:09.264 --> 01:43:10.848
Stop it, please!

1076
01:43:10.849 --> 01:43:14.477
Did you ever go to that amusement park?

1077
01:43:14.478 --> 01:43:19.478
The one they closed down
because the rollercoaster flew off the...

1078
01:43:25.822 --> 01:43:27.114
Call a doctor!

1079
01:43:27.115 --> 01:43:29.659
...and she threatened to take
every last dime,

1080
01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.869
even all his properties...

1081
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:34.622
- We're taking her home...
- Yes, that'd be the best.

1082
01:43:34.623 --> 01:43:39.623
I'm very sorry about this.
It was still a wonderful party.

1083
01:43:40.379 --> 01:43:41.712
Excuse me, please.

1084
01:43:41.713 --> 01:43:45.466
Most of the cuts are superficial,
they'll heal quickly.

1085
01:43:45.467 --> 01:43:47.927
But we'll take her in just to make sure

1086
01:43:47.928 --> 01:43:49.553
that no tendons are torn.

1087
01:43:49.554 --> 01:43:52.723
Does she have good medical insurance?

1088
01:43:52.724 --> 01:43:56.394
Romina, please, go back inside.

1089
01:43:56.395 --> 01:43:59.146
I'm just asking about her insurance.

1090
01:43:59.147 --> 01:44:04.147
Great. Stay there.

1091
01:44:06.029 --> 01:44:09.990
I'm fine.

1092
01:44:09.991 --> 01:44:12.493
Romi, dear, are you okay?

1093
01:44:12.494 --> 01:44:17.494
- Are you sure?
- Yes, don't worry. Relax.

1094
01:44:17.958 --> 01:44:22.958
Why don't we use this break
to cut the cake?

1095
01:44:32.681 --> 01:44:35.933
Come on, girls,
don't leave me hanging here.

1096
01:44:35.934 --> 01:44:40.934
Come on, girls.

1097
01:44:41.356 --> 01:44:44.316
It's been a terrible night,
but now I want to relax

1098
01:44:44.317 --> 01:44:48.195
and enjoy my wedding.

1099
01:44:48.196 --> 01:44:52.408
I don't think I'll get married again.

1100
01:44:52.409 --> 01:44:54.952
Now!

1101
01:44:54.953 --> 01:44:57.872
Romi!

1102
01:44:57.873 --> 01:44:59.999
Mili, you got it!

1103
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.543
I can't believe it!

1104
01:45:02.544 --> 01:45:07.544
A picture with Mili!

1105
01:45:11.845 --> 01:45:14.680
Wouldn't you like to marry Mili?

1106
01:45:14.681 --> 01:45:16.390
Come on!

1107
01:45:16.391 --> 01:45:19.477
All the rest may be bullshit,

1108
01:45:19.478 --> 01:45:21.520
but let's prove the ring tradition
comes true!

1109
01:45:21.521 --> 01:45:22.772
Wouldn't that be great?

1110
01:45:22.773 --> 01:45:24.815
Stop, Romi.

1111
01:45:24.816 --> 01:45:29.816
Kiss...

1112
01:45:34.034 --> 01:45:38.120
We should do the garters,
toss the bouquet...

1113
01:45:38.121 --> 01:45:40.289
Do you want to continue
or call this off?

1114
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:42.166
We're calling it off.

1115
01:45:42.167 --> 01:45:43.542
We're calling it off.

1116
01:45:43.543 --> 01:45:46.378
But why? You're such a party pooper!

1117
01:45:46.379 --> 01:45:50.216
Girls, here it goes!

1118
01:45:50.217 --> 01:45:53.093
Besides, we still haven't had
the hot pastrami.

1119
01:45:53.094 --> 01:45:55.304
Boy, that was expensive!

1120
01:45:55.305 --> 01:45:56.639
Ariel, tell them.

1121
01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.018
We spent a whole week arguing
about the pastrami.

1122
01:46:01.019 --> 01:46:04.230
We decided on it, we paid for it,
and now I want some.

1123
01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:06.732
Romina! Stop it!

1124
01:46:06.733 --> 01:46:08.692
Let everyone go home.

1125
01:46:08.693 --> 01:46:10.820
This isn't a joke.

1126
01:46:10.821 --> 01:46:15.821
My family's lawyer even suggested
I press charges against you.

1127
01:46:23.124 --> 01:46:26.627
Don't tell me this is all mommy's idea.

1128
01:46:26.628 --> 01:46:29.547
Cut it out, Romina!

1129
01:46:29.548 --> 01:46:31.715
Your mom is a real...

1130
01:46:31.716 --> 01:46:33.175
wedding planner.

1131
01:46:33.176 --> 01:46:36.929
Stop it!

1132
01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:38.973
What did I do to you?

1133
01:46:38.974 --> 01:46:43.974
It was nothing compared to
what you're doing to me!

1134
01:46:50.694 --> 01:46:52.444
Son,

1135
01:46:52.445 --> 01:46:55.239
please, calm down.

1136
01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:00.240
Please.

1137
01:47:00.579 --> 01:47:05.579
God...

1138
01:47:06.751 --> 01:47:10.254
Shoot this, Nestor.

1139
01:47:10.255 --> 01:47:14.174
Nestor, turn the camera on.

1140
01:47:14.175 --> 01:47:17.136
You too, get over here.

1141
01:47:17.137 --> 01:47:21.348
Shoot this, please.

1142
01:47:21.349 --> 01:47:24.602
If I get married again...

1143
01:47:24.603 --> 01:47:28.772
If I ever find a guy who's worth it...

1144
01:47:28.773 --> 01:47:33.773
I'm going to show this video
at our wedding!

1145
01:47:34.613 --> 01:47:37.531
I'll even watch this with my kids.

1146
01:47:37.532 --> 01:47:42.532
Instead of Dora the Explorer
and all that crap, I'll play this video.

1147
01:47:43.663 --> 01:47:45.039
I know!

1148
01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:49.376
I'll put it on one of those digital picture
frames that play photos

1149
01:47:49.377 --> 01:47:54.377
in a loop!

1150
01:47:54.716 --> 01:47:58.427
Get off my daughter, bitch.

1151
01:47:58.428 --> 01:47:59.887
Stay out or it's hell!

1152
01:47:59.888 --> 01:48:02.014
I was going to help you, Bocha.

1153
01:48:02.015 --> 01:48:07.015
<i>(Luca, some here.</i>

1154
01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:13.730
Honey, are you all right?

1155
01:48:45.392 --> 01:48:49.144
Doctor!

1156
01:48:49.145 --> 01:48:52.231
You take care of her,
you take him.

1157
01:48:52.232 --> 01:48:53.691
What is he on?

1158
01:48:53.692 --> 01:48:56.610
Nothing, he had an emotional shock.
No drugs here...

1159
01:48:56.611 --> 01:48:57.903
Can you walk?

1160
01:48:57.904 --> 01:49:00.698
What's the name of the bride?

1161
01:49:00.699 --> 01:49:02.533
Romina...

1162
01:49:02.534 --> 01:49:07.534
I need you to sit down so
I can take your blood pressure.

1163
01:49:08.206 --> 01:49:10.249
A chair, Mauro!

1164
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:11.333
Sit down.

1165
01:49:11.334 --> 01:49:15.004
Take his jacket off, please.

1166
01:49:15.005 --> 01:49:20.005
Can you sit down?

1167
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.137
Are you okay?

1168
01:49:23.138 --> 01:49:28.138
Relax, Romi, relax.

1169
01:49:30.979 --> 01:49:35.979
Can you get her some water'?

1170
01:49:38.737 --> 01:49:39.862
Easy, Romi.

1171
01:49:39.863 --> 01:49:44.863
You just need to rest.

1172
01:50:00.008 --> 01:50:05.008
Wait, Ariel.

1173
01:50:05.722 --> 01:50:08.307
Calm down.

1174
01:50:08.308 --> 01:50:13.308
It's fine.

1175
01:50:21.446 --> 01:50:24.114
Nothing happened.
We are all right. Okay?

1176
01:50:24.115 --> 01:50:29.115
Relax.

1177
01:50:54.187 --> 01:50:59.187
No, Ariel!

1178
01:51:50.994 --> 01:51:55.994
Easy“.

1179
01:55:41.474 --> 01:55:46.474
To my father

1180
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:56.510
Subtitling: L.V.T. - Paris
