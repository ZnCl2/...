I don't want to fuel editor-wars here, of course, but it works for me so well that I can't really see myself using anything else anymore these days.\n\nSmall and *portable*, I carry it pretty much everywhere to avoid having to use some other editor. What other application could embrace the hacker's spirit so well as vim?",

			"body": "Awesome! I should try doing this with my home server too. I've gotten pretty lazy with self-hosting ever since I got done with XMPP, so this could be an interesting exercise to get back on my feet.\n\nBTW I see everyone in the internet indicating Nginx for web servers today. Is it really that lightweight? I've been using `lighttpd` so far, but would try it out if it was better.\n\nThank you for an awesome post, man!",
