It works now, but there are two more videos listed, though can not be deleted from GUI.\n\nIt happened because files from those videos were not created. Third time I've tried to upload them, I have deleted spaces from file name, and it has helped. However first two videos are not listed in the video box and can not be deleted from the site. Files are absent, so I guess that it is a content.json error. I can't sign it now so I'll have to leave it the way it is for now.\n\nRegards,\nMK",
