                <h1>Bwoi has re-branded to become RVRE.</h1>
                <p>Hey all!<br>You might have noticed a major change in the way Bwoi looks - we've decided that Bwoi sounds quite unprofessional and refers to more than one thing, so to eradicate confusion we've decided to re-brand to RVRE. What this means is that nothing major has changed apart from the overall appearance of the site, and in the near future RVRE will be given a full re-write (including the internal search engine) using the new Sublime Design Language developed in-house. We also hope that this re-brand increases user interaction and brings more users towards both ZeroNet and RVRE, as well as helping us to re-define searching on ZeroNet through various adjustments planned over time. More information will be given in the coming weeks - watch this space!<br>- Alex</p>
