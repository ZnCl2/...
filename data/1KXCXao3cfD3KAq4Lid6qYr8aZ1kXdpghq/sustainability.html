Sustainability / Recycling<br>
<br>
We have a limited time here on Earth. We have our natural biological age limit, but we also have limitations from the resources on Earth, and the amount of energy the sun will provide before engulfing the planet. This is a huge problem, and one that we as a <a href="solidarity.html">collective society<a> need to overcome.
<br><br>
One way to overcome these issues is by becoming more efficient at what we do, and by reducing the strain on the resources. Minimalism is the philosophy of getting rid of all of the junk in our life, and only taking and using what we actually <i>need.</i> Of course, recycling is something we all know, and is very important as well. Recycling has three parts: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Reduce clearly refers to minimalism. Reduce the amount of things you need or use.
<br><br>
Reuse is a bit more complicated, and the one people tend to forget. Using a single thing many times is much better than using many things once. This allows us to improve our efficiency, and lower the amount of waste generated. For example, why use a physical DVD to watch a movie once, and have a bunch of DVDs so that each person may have a copy. When we could just have it digital, and <a href="knowledgetoall.html">allow everyone to watch the same file,</a> distributed in a digital and decentralized manner. This reduces any physical resources to practically nothing, allows for efficient sharing and watching of the film, and prevents tons of waste by being able to reuse the file. Deleting the file will also allow us to reuse the hard drive space for something else. Win-Win-Win!
<br><br>
Recycle is the last part of the set. And most people think of recycling as just throwing it stuff in the recycling bin and letting "others" take care of it. This is an incredibly poor solution, as it essentially just encourages waste. Instead, try to recyle things yourself. Find someone who might need something you have and don't want/need anymore. If you can't, try turning the thing into something else you would use.
<br><br>
Striving for efficiency also <a href="improve.html">improves</a> your ability to survive and help life thrive. A good thing to keep in mind is that we should be getting lots of value out of just a few resources. And we should focus on wasting less energy and effort on inanimate things, and conserving that for the production and survival of life.
<br><br>
In our modern day society, this means that ultimately we should have 0% employment. People wasting very little of their time doing tasks that are largely useless (and a few people doing necessary tasks). Instead, we can use automation to improve our pipelines and offloads the work to inanimate machines that can be made much more efficient than we can make humans. This lets humans do what we do best.
