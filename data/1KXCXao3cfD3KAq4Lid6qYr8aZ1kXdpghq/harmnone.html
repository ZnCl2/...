	Lucidism - The pursuit of lucidity.<br>
	<span id="time"></span>

<b>Life is Precious.</b> Life being a thing is why you are even here reading this. It's the reason you exist! Life is incredibly unique and rare in the universe. Earth is the only known location that life can and does occur. Out of the billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars. Only Earth! It's the one thing in the universe that works opposite to entropy, our natural enemy. Life works to become more complex, and work to reproduce and sustain oneself. Nothing else in the universe does this. We're also the the only things in the universe to experience qualia, which is what allows us to have a soul.
<br><br>
So with that said, it's important to <a href="solidarity.html">take care of your bretheren,</a> as otherwise we'd be alone. And indeed cooperation trumps competition. Two are more able than one. Life should be cherished and encouraged. And with that we arrive at this pillar and core of Lucidism:
<br><br>
<b>HARM NONE</b>
<br><br>
That's right. Nothing. Harm no living thing. There is absolutely no reason to, and it only harms our chances of survival. It sounds easy on paper, right? Just don't physically assault each other. That's all there is to it, right? Wrong. Animals and plants are life too. And as a result, we should protect and cherish them. <b>All life</b> is precious. And with reincarnation (what happens upon death), you're really only hurting yourself if you support or encourage harm to others.
<br><br>
<i>"But what would I eat?"</i> you might ask. Fortunately, we don't actually need to harm anything to eat and live! Plants are wonderful organisms that allow us to safely and peacefully eat and sustain ourselves. Things like fruits, legumes, seeds, nuts, beans, berries, mushrooms, grains, and more are all able to be eaten without any harm to the plant. Another thing to note is that this also means we need to cut out any <i>non-food products</i> that rely on plants as well. Any wood products, any natural rubber, paper, etc. It's a large burden, but one that needs to be done if we want our fellow life to thrive and survive.
<br><br>
Plants are incredibly intelligent, can feel, "smell", and ultimately live just like you or me. They have families and can recognize them, they can intelligently seek out food, or communicate with other plants or even bugs and animals. They scream out and cry for help if they're injured. So let's be nice to plants. ðŸ˜„

Reproduce and Duplicate to survive<br>
Process, not end result<br>

"This too, shall pass."<br>

We are one<br>
