	Lucidism - The pursuit of lucidity.<br>
	<span id="time"></span>

Pursuing lucidity is naturally the absolute foundation and core value of Lucidism. But what is lucidity? The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines lucidity as:
<br><br>
1. Clearness of thought or style.<br>
2. A presumed capacity to <a href="knowledgetoall.html">perceive the truth</a> directly and instantaneously.
<br><br>

And dictionary.com defines lucid as:
<br><br>
1. Easily understood; completely intelligible or comprehensible.<br>
2. Characterized by clear perception or understanding; rational or sane.<br>
3. Shining or bright.
<br><br>

That is to say, lucidity is about being connected with the world. Being absolutely clear and <a href="sustainability.html">efficient</a> in both mind and body, and being able to <a href="improve.html">execute smoothly.</a> Along with being able to understand something perfectly, and being able to maximize efficiency and clarity. Perhaps a mastery of life itself. When dreaming, there is a concept called "lucid dreaming", which is where you are absolutely aware of everything in the dream, and can freely control and manipulate it to your will and desire. So by "pursuing lucidity" the goal here is to be absolutely aware of everything in life, and be able to freely control and manipulate it to our will and desire.<br><br>

For some examples of true lucidity, look at the great masters of our world. Einstein was clear and efficient in thought. Mozart in music. Bruce Lee in martial arts. Each had mastered their craft. Being able to do such efficiently, easily, and quickly is the goal. To build up a foundation to allow <i>everyone</i> to achieve such levels.<br><br>

Pursuing lucidity, as such, is the core and primary pillar that will work as the foundation for everything else. How can one achieve mastery with a cloudy mind and imperfect actions?
