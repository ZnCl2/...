	Lucidism - The pursuit of lucidity.<br>
	<span id="time"></span>

One core value of Lucidism is the pursuit of omniscience. Sharing and aquiring as much knowledge and information as possible. Gathering and sharing knowledge has plenty of society and individual benefits, and is an invaluable tool for creating a utopia. It's a natural human desire to go from a state of unknown to a state of known.
<br><br>
As such, many of our values stem from these ideas. Such as some core values from Kopimism, which has this as their central premise:<br><br>

– Copying of information is ethically right.<br>
– Dissemination of information is ethically right.<br>
– Copymixing is a sacred kind of copying, moreso than the perfect, digital copying, because it expands and enhances the existing wealth of information<br>
– Copying or remixing information communicated by another person is seen as an act of respect and a strong expression of acceptance and Kopimistic (And Lucidist) faith.<br>
