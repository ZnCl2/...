	Lucidism - The pursuit of lucidity.<br>

Improve and Enhance<br>
<br>
Lucidism is all about improving yourself and helping others improve themselves. Pursuing Lucidity is part of that, but improvement on it's own grounds is also desirable. Improving ourselves lets us become more lucid, more efficient, more sustainable, and ultimately more skilled. It lets us achieve our goals much quicker.
<br><br>
Improvement is also a natural part of evolution. If our species didn't improve, we would have died off and become extinct! In nature, how improvement was done was through reproducing to evolve, and thus creating slight modifications but otherwise a perfect reproduction. This allowed for the best of the species to thrive and reproduce the most, duplicating the improvements. <a href="solidarity.html">Using a community to spread the improvements, rather than keeping it isolated.</a>
<br><br>
Transhumanism takes this a step further. Instead of waiting for nature to evolve our bodies, we are going to do it ourselves. We can do this with a variety of technology. Implants, electronic modifications, etc. By becoming cyborgs (part machine), we can improve our capabilities much more quickly.
<br><br>
This sort of improvement is very needed. It's a natural part of life. Life being the infinitely reproducing self-improving collective network that efficiently stays within the bounds of it's enemy: entropy. As "life" we're a part of that battle to overcome the natural state of the universe (chaos). By <a href="sustainability.html">becoming efficient and sustainable,</a> and improving those metrics, we can slow our inevitable decay, and perhaps overcome it some day (ideally!). Life is unique in the universe as it's the only thing that actually goes against the natural chaos.
<br><br>
We can uncover facts like these, as well as be able to improve ourselves and become more efficient, by <a href="knowledgetoall.html">pursuing the truth and information about the world around us.</a>

"Don't settle. Keep changing. Evolve."<br>
"You have to look at it differently if you want to uncover the truth. And if it eludes you, then look at what it leaves behind."<br>
"What am I doing? What's the overall process that this specific action is a part of, and what are the steps involved?"<br>
"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."<br>
