			"body": "The first zite I am going to showcase is [Snake Game](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JsJ1JitaLboc8pvo4fxh9dvP8mt6toPrE), which is an HTML5 version of the game Snake. \nUse your arrow keys to control the snake and collect dots to make him longer. Watch out for the walls and yourself as crashing into one of them results in a game over.\n I really like the simplicity of this version. The sound effects and music are addictive and crisp. \n[Check out Snake Game now!](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JsJ1JitaLboc8pvo4fxh9dvP8mt6toPrE)\n\nPlease consider supporting ZeroNet is Awesome by becoming a peer."
