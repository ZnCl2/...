				"body": "In a theoretical utopia, I think open borders are probably the best. Let people move around freely.\n\nIn practice, the US really needs to crack down on immigration (particularly the illegal kind). Simplify the immigration process, stop people from coming in illegally, etc.\n\nHaving a single country with open borders doesn't really work. You get an asymmetrical flow of people. You need many places with open borders between them. Much like how the various states work. You can freely travel from california to nevada to utah with no issue. Ideally the world should be like that. But there's obvious economic and legal issues that happen if you just rush ahead and do that for a single country.",
