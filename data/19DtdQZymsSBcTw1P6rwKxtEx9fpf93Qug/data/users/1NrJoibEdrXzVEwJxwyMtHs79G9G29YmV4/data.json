However, if one did as Hitler supposedly did, killing the defective ones and eliminating the undesirables, then you might have a point, if you could verify the figures as accurate. But remember, slavery doesn't count. However, that is not much of a civilization. A nation can do better. However, as far as authoritarianism, the US and much of the world is well on the way with the covid experiment, the CCP and the \"great reset\". I hope you like what is on the other side.",
