				"body": "I'd like to replace Capitalism in the debate too. What about \"Scroungers\" vs \"A Better Paradigm\". \nUlitmately every political or economic system ends with scroungers on its top, people who get a lot more out of the system than they put in. One might think this is caused by human nature, but it isn't. Scrungers are made by centralized systems out of the human nature.\nHuman nature is to act in their own benefit. The opposite would'nt be a very smart idea. But human nature is also to behave more or less fair. We compair our situation whis those around us and almost nobody will claim all benefits for himself and leave the rest alone.  Centralized systems limit the opinion for such comparisions to lets say one level below and one level up of the own. Bill Gates can not compare his performance and income with a saleswoman in a supermarket, he compairs against Warren Buffet. From this point of view, he acts more or less fair.\nThe lower payed have their scope on unemployeed and those who earn a little bit more. It's the same situation in the whole pyramid.\nThis leads me to the conclusion, that the better paradigm is decentralisation.",
