I am looking for legitimate mail-oder bride websites. Google provided me with little. And going on the deep web would probably land me on a site trying to sell me a 10 year old Japanese sex slave which...Hell no. Just no.\n\nI am just a shy man who has difficulty meeting people and yeah yeah I know all about potentially being used to get a citezenship or whatever, don't care. I just want this. If someone could direct me to a service that isn't illegal I would be most grateful.\n\nyou can send information to me at mrtaxi@protonmail.com"
