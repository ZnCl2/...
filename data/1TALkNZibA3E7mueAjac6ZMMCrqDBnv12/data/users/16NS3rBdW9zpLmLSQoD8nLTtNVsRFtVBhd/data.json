Although not visible in the ZeroLSTN interface, your account name will still be tied to the songs you upload. You can find this out for yourself by navigating to the Zeronet data folder on your computer, on Linux the 2010's hub is located in /var/lib/zeronet/1HLqL1eSZTRMpKLXjprjy7hFftuoAZEz1u/data/users. Here you will find all content of the hub sorted in folders by the user's Bitcoin address. You can easily do the mapping from Bitcoin address to a user name, for example by hovering the mouse over my name right above this post, and it will show you my Bitcoin address. Then just find a folder with the same address in the location above, and you'll see the content.json file listing all songs I have uploaded to 2010's hub. If you also have listened to these particular songs, you'll find the mp3 files in this folder also, if not then you'll just find the content.json file.If you are concerned about privacy, create a separate ZeroID for uploading songs. [...]\n\nYeah, ZeroNet is still in an obscurity safe zone. I know that for a fact, but I can't say why. I think the greedy and powerful are even afraid of people learning about it. It would be the Streisand Effect.",
