KopyKate can also be used to share music. https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ and other downloaders can download audio only in webm format so it can be added as a video on a site like kopykate and also there is IFS and Kxovid, but none is easy to use as a media player (usually no playlist functionality, low number of content) so far.ZeroLSTN is most close to nice music library site.\n\nThanks for the info. I guess I'll stick with Spotify for now.",
