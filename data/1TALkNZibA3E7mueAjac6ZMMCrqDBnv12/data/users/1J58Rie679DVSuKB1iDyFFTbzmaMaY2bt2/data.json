The torrents are huge and the good/bad ratio is about 1 of 10ish. Meaning out of 900 songs I will likely pick out ~70 good ones.",

It would be the Streisand Effect.\n\nI suspect the cancellation of nofish's TED Talk about Zeronet was a last minute cancel for this very reason.\nIt is an operational demonstration that the audience is forbidden to know about as they may decide to be early adopters as well.",
