Most probably, it won't be visible in NetworkManager as a network device and may require manual configuration using distributive's native network configuration means.\n\nThanks for the info. And sorry for the late reply, I never noticed your response in my feed.",

Is there some other way to do it?\n\nAlso I don't think I can use a different modem: the data-only plan I have from my telco has restrictions. I only get unlimited data if I use the SIM in the device they provided, the E5377, and only at my home address. I tried putting the SIM in another device, a phone, and using it elsewhere, but the connection was soon throttled & capped.\n\nThanks for all your help.",
