Filecoin's idea is to give cryptocurrency tokens to the people hosting data for others.\n\nThe project is lead by Juan Benet from Protocol Labs which is also the creator of the beloved IPFS Protocol.\n\nA small intro video being better than a thousand words, enjoy : [https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EClPAFPeXIQ](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EClPAFPeXIQ)\n\nFilecoin is currently in **testnet** phase meaning it's not yet launched but the protocol is stable enough to be tested on the global scale.\n\nI think Filecoin has the potential to become a major building block in the Web 3 world and given the track record of its Dev team, the future looks bright for this protocol :)"

I did the test and actually tinc runs very fine as a layer to encrypt your local network traffic.\n\nI am now running my file server and my main machine with tinc enabled and mounting my shares via the _tinc-assigned_ IP addresses, I can see my local network traffic flowing on the tun interfaces.\n\n![tinc_screenie.jpg (1200x675)](data/img/post_21_tinc_screenie.jpg)\n\nGood times ! I highly recommend this software as a lightweight VPN alternative or if you need to quickly get a mesh network up and running.\n\nI hope everyone will have a lovely holiday season and a great start of 2020, here's to another decade 🥂"

If you don't know, Linux is making strides in becoming a great, open platform for gaming, either with natives titles such as the one I am reviewing or with the help of a translation layer like Steam Proton or Wine to run Windows games with good performance.\n\n![IM.jpg (1200x675)](data/img/post_14_IM.jpg)\n\nInterstellar Marines is a sci-fi atmospheric **early-access** FPS set in the near future where mankind has conquered another solar system.\n\nYou're being trained on various scenarios to become an elite force called the Interstellar Marines.\n\nThe game is based on the Unity engine and is very pretty to look at while also running smoothly, there's both several single players missions already implemented and a tiny but active community around the multiplayer parts of the game.\n\nThe main selling point of the game is definitely its atmosphere with 9 varied biomes to fight on (in the \"Wargames\" part of the game), day/night cycles and different weather conditions.\n\nThe accent is also put on gunplay realism with lean left/right feature ala Rainbow Six, decreasing damage depending on range, stealth and a great sound direction. The AI works well and is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe game has a kind of troubled development phase since it's in the works since 2013 (It's actually one of the oldest early access titles on Steam !) but at its current price, the game is really worth a shot if you like sci-fi, FPS and aren't afraid of early access games.\n\n**Rating**\n\nGraphics : 8.5/10 - _It's pretty !_\n\nGameplay : 8/10 - _Very solid gunplay and immersion, fun co-op_\n\nContent : 5/10 - _It's an early access title with slow development pace_\n\nOverall value per $ : 10/10 - _Pretty cheap for what it packs !_\n\nFinal rating : **7.8/10** _- Approved !_\n\nSteam Link (clearnet) : [https://store.steampowered.com/app/236370/Interstellar_Marines/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/236370/Interstellar_Marines/)\n\nHappy gaming !"

It's open source and available on most unix-like systems package managers nowadays.\n\nMore info on clearnet at [https://fishshell.com/](https://fishshell.com/)"
