			"body": "> [jamesholden](#comment_6_12w3zJ6gRrcAw2kSCQXDkorgqxuXnkKkF8): I guess if you click on the \"clone\" button there http://127.0.0.1:43110/1GitLiXB6t5r8vuU2zC6a8GYj9ME6HMQ4t/repo/?1NaRTgwxsn17BCVSfvq6LG8NVPb9srKG5X you'll be able to clone the repo properly. But in fact, I'm not really familiar with Gitcenter on ZN which is a bit different from the usual Git servers I'm used to. Maybe @Gitcenter on ZeroMe can help ?\n> In any case, if you want the code, I can zip it and share it with you, just let me know :)\n\nHey James. Thanks for taking the time to answer. I got it figured out ;)",
