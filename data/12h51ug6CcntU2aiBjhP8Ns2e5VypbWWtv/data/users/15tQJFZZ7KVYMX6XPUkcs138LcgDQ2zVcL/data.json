The EME backdoor is why the EU passed article 13 so they can spy on you, and use the EME to censor what you can view on the web. Kill the EME. Remove it from the open web standards, and Fork the w3c and Tim Berners-Lee. This is why they are secretly, fraudulently offering so much money to popular and important projects like VLC. Spread the word. Contact the EFF, FSF, UN and others. The whole world objected to the inclusion of the embeded \"closed source\" untouchable EME in the OPEN! web standards. But TBL included it anyway. The EME must go. The EME must be **killed**. 30 MILLION EUR! How much did they pay EU MP's for artical 13. Think about it.",

While  most of you are clueless as to why your broke ass is hurting.\n\nFor example, most of the US's so called deficit spending is really just theft. A highly advanced form of political white collar crime.\n\nIt's a combination of government mismanagement. Corrupt spending priorities. And unfair and inadequate taxation. Entitlements are not the problem. Political corruption is the problem. \n\nNearly a hundred years ago US politicians promised the American people two chickens in every pot on Sunday, and two cars in every garage. Yet many US citizens still go hungry in America. While the US sends billions of dollars in financial aid to some of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\nAs RT as previously reported, the US is sending 40 to 50 billion dollars in financial aid to one of the richest countries in the world, Israel. $34,000 per Jew Israeli household.  While many United States citizens go hungry and scramble to find food. \n\nSome members of Congress are so corrupt, stupid and arrogant as to complain about doing too much for We The People Of The United States, their bosses. The 40 to 50 billion dollars to Israel would give each adult United States Citizen! $200+ a month in grocery money a year.\n\nThe 40 to 50 billion per year to Israel is just financial aid to Israel. It doesn't include the hundreds of billions we've already given Israel. Or the probably trillions we've already given Israel in Military Support. I suspect much of our trillion dollar deficit is directly related to spending for racist apartheid Israel. Disgusting scumbags.\n\nWe don't know exact numbers. Because Congress refuses to give We The People Of The United States a full accounting of the total amount Congress has assisted Israel in stealing from us.\n\nCongress better finally come up with the \"chickens in every pot on Sunday\" that was promised, a 100 years ago. We already have a system in place in every state of the United States. All they have to do is send everyone a SNAP card with $200 or more in grocery money on it every month.\n\nIf Congress doesn't do so soon, heads are going to roll politically. From the White House on down. Enough is enough. \n\nThose selfish greedy bastards can look at it this way. That grocery money goes right back into the US economy, because everyone has to eat. Creeps!..😀\n\n</pre>",

In other words SARS-2 (Covid-19) lethality is astronomically high. Just like it's Daddy, SARS-1.\n\nThe solution to opening the greatest economy the world has ever known is simple, **(Medicare For All)**. **NO ONE!** should return to work without it.\n\nPresident Trump must **Not!** open the economy without the **full emergency activation of (Medicare For All)**. In accordance with senator **Bernie Sanders bill and recommendations**. On at least a temporary basis. For the full duration of the covid-19 crisis.\n\nTo do so would be **genocide, and a crime against humanity**. Reasonable people can disagree about whether we were adequately informed. Or acted aggressively enough to stem the death and destruction from covid-19.\n\nBut **President Trump, Dr. Fauci, Dr Birx, the Governors and Congress** fully understand what they are dealing with now. They fully understand the threat covid-19 poses to the people of the United States, and the World.\n\n**President Trump** has said he's **watching what other countries** are doing. But the **main thing other countries have done**, is make sure that all of their people have **excellent! Universal Health Care**. For this medical crisis, and any other their countries may face.\n\nWe don't know whether covid-19 is the result of a **spontaneous occurrence**. An **accidental release**. Or **asymmetrical warfare**. All we know is that the people of the United States have been left **naked and exposed** to this **National Security threat**. Because of a lack of quality, comprehensive Universal Health Care.\n\n\"You got to ask yourself. Do you feel lucky. Well do you punks?\" -Dirty Harry..🦠🌎🔥😐\n\n</pre>",

And a catastrophe of criminal proportions to send the people back into the fight without medical support and protection.\n\nAlso, we would've had dramatically fewer people on **ventilators**, with its **extremely high mortality rate** (approx **60-88%**). But you all got **sold a bill of goods** on ventilators.\n\nMany people are being **pushed on to ventilators**. **When supplemental oxygen, time, attention and aggressive respiratory therapy was all they needed**. But that doesn't **pay** as well as **ramming a tube down your throats**.\n\n**For-profit healthcare** is making **big bucks, a killing** literally.
