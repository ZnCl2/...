It seems that some of the names in the list are machine generated.\nPerhaps we may find their patterns and build a countermeasure to pretend such IDs from registering at all ?\nOr maybe there can be an export/import mute list feature in future versions of zeronet?\n\nps:i personally don't believe that simply banning all chinese ips is the solution.The regular chinese users are already suffering from GFW.If Zeronet banned all chinese ips,that means the government would win and the spammers' purpose would be filled,meanwhile regular users from china would lose a way to reach outside worlds.",
