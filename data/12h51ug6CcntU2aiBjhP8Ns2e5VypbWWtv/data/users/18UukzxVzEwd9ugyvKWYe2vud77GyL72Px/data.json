I do fear our technology isn't ready yet for sites the size of sadpanda. This isn't anyone's fault, it's incredible what the zeronet developers and site developers have been able to realize.\n\n###\n\nOn that note thank you @1pgallery for the new galleryhub version, without it managing a 2000+ sized hub was getting very painful. That's why I started a second hub instead of uploading to my old one. I wonder how big I can make it now before it gets too slow? If I had to bet I'd say I could probably push it to 10k+ at least.\nNot to preasure you or anything, but could you please make a \"latest comments\" tab or something? Maybe show number of comments for each gallery on the front page?\n\n###\n\nI had no idea things were that bad in the Netherlands, I would've thought considering their lax stance on drugs they'd be far more forgiving when it comes to cartoon drawings.",
