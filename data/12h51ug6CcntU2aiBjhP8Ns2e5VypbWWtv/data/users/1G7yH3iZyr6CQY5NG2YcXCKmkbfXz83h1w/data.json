To view user data you need to add Hubs as merger sites to ZeroMe. You automatically get the hub you choose when you join, but other users may be on other hubs so you need to connect to them to see posts by those users,",

I only know of the site [0hub.bit](http://127.0.0.1:43110/0hub.bit) that allows you to add multiple hubs to zerome. I still have profiles I can't see though so maybe I'm missing hubs.",
