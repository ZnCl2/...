And this is alarmist, but I think right now, it’s justified. This one reminds me of what I have read about the 1918 Spanish influenza. And the reason I say that is because, right now, the only measure we have for the death rate from this flu is a study that the Chinese did of the first 45,000 cases. And of those, 80 percent were mild. 20 percent were various degrees of seriousness, up to critical and on a respirator and in organ failure. And 2.3 percent died. Now, 2.5 percent mortality is about the mortality rate of the 1918 flu.\nmichael barbaro\n\n>    Which was a very big deal.\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n>\n>    It was a very big deal epidemic. Now, it’s not the Black Death. In the Black Death, a third of the world died. But in 1918, not everybody died, but everybody knew somebody who died. I mean, my oldest friend’s grandmother died. She was a young woman with two kids. She died. Another guy I talked to said, oh, yeah, my grandmother’s sister died in that one.\nmichael barbaro\n>\n>    I thought you were here to bring calm, Donald.\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n>\n>    I’m trying to bring a sense that if things don’t change, a lot of us might die. If you have 300 relatively close friends and acquaintances, six of them would die in a 2.5 percent mortality situation.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus.html",

			"body": "@weakish: please don't buy any products from Sony either!\n> Sony publishes incomplete Linux kernel source code\n> I've been trying to find the source code of the Linux kernel Sony uses on its PRS-T1 reader. From Sony's Open Source pages [1] [2], a search for “PRS-T1” leads to these two pages (for the non-Russian/Japanese versions):\n>\n> http://www.sony.net/Products/Linux/Audio/PRS-T1.html\n> http://www.sony.net/Products/Linux/A..._20111114.html\n>\n> The Linux tarballs distributed from these pages do not seem to correspond to the Linux trees actually used to build the kernel on the device, though: Comparing the device's /proc/config.gz with the options actually present in the distributed source code shows that various configuration options appear in the build, but not in the source code, and (less significantly) also vice versa. For example, the running kernel has set a configuration option CONFIG_READER_WIFI, which does not appear in the source code at all.\n>\n> I'd be interested in the real Linux source code as used on the device. Is there another place to look for it? If there isn't, Sony may be in violation of the kernel's GPL license.\n> \n> [1] https://products.sel.sony.com/opensource/\n> [2] http://www.sony.net/Products/Linux/common/search.html \n\nsrc: https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=187615",
