			"body": "@Tusiko: Plz study. You're just picking your favorite parts from the wikipedia without understanding anything about what they mean. Old Testament are those well authorized prophecies and lineage records and history of the very early members of ancestors of Abraham. \n.\nSince Jesus's birth was already prophesied just after Adam and Eve's exile from Eden, and King David who was in Juda's  blood line were always singing and making poems about Jesus's coming (Psalm), and every part of the old testament is describing about Jesus in the future as a Messiah, it cannot be just a taken-over document but essential document to verify the new testament. \n.\nFor example the book Daniel in the old testament is talking about the future world powers who will appear in series after Media-Persia Kingdom where Daniel was a prime minister, and describes the last kingdom (of Jesus) who will conquer all those human powers at last. \n.\nWhen Alexander the Great arrived at Israel, those high priests of Israel even brought that old testament to Alexander and explained him how their god (Jehova) prophesied his coming hundreds years in advance. Alexander was one of those powers described in the book Daniel. The first century historian Josephus confirmed this event. How can the new testament and the old testament could be separated as long as every part of the old testament is talking about Messiah in the new testament?\n.\nThat's why many of Jewish in the first century confirmed that Jesus, the son of Joseph and Maria, was the king, Messiah about whom they had been taught  and heard of in the old testament everyday since they were kids. They knew every single evidence which the Messiah had to show when he comes.\n.\nBut many of them were also disappointed as Jesus didn't want them to rebel against Roman empire but ordered them to obey the worldly powers and to preach the advent of his kingdom in the future(!). They expected a kind of super hero like King David to rescue themselves from Roman empire. But Jesus gave them a contract sheet that all their sins were paid by the death of himself. He declared that not only jewish but also entire population of the world came to get a ticket to the heaven. (Actually a small number of heavenly tickets, but most tickets for earthly everlasting life for the remaining people) \n. \nIn regard with the letters in the new testament written by the apostle Paul (such as Letters to Corinthians, Letters to Romans, etc), they're not something like mouth to mouth transferred stories, but well preserved documents explaining about the Jesus's commands by showing the evidences quoting many parts of the old testament. Regarding Revelations, it's just another prophecy after many from the old testament (such as Daniel, Isiah, etc). Old and new testaments are all talking about one single theme, \"Jesus will/had save(ed) the human being by paying for their sins committed since Adam violated God's commands in Eden.\"\n.\nThe entire human history or bible history is simply an essential procedure to make a true free-will humanoid or human. We're a part of the huge AI project. God doesn't need all those annoying and noisy events in human history to be happened if he just wanted hard coded/programmed obeying robots without allowing a smallest mis-behavior. He truely wanted something to regard as his true friends, not robots. \n.\n[John 15:13 Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I command. 15 I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.](https://www.biblestudytools.com/john/passage/?q=john+15)",

But none of them has ever apologized for their false FAITH. They still keep their FAITH.\n.\nThey're records of the true history. Most historians have never experienced everything what they wrote down on the history book but rather have heard of or referenced of as precisely as possible they could based on the evidence they gathered. And people believes that Rome was conquered by the Germanic barbarians. Did somebody video-recorded that moment? No. But they still believe it. Maybe it can be called just a 'faith' believing some useless letters written mouth-to-mouth transferred stories on very old a sheet of useless paper. People can judge it very easily unless they have an idea to check it in person. \"Oh, you're tell me a bull shit! Rome is still there, what the hell are u talking about?\"\n.\nLet's see that if one story teller told a length of story and many parts of it were proved truth but some parts could not be proved because of the lack of understanding or lack of technological ground of the audience. Is it reasonable to call him a liar? What if more parts are getting proved day by day? Since there're still some suspicious parts in his story, he's still a liar? If his story is filling some missing parts of well known stories among people, it's rather clever to rely on his story to put the pieces of a puzzle together in order to find out the TRUTH.\n. \nThey called him a liar by pointing that Daniel's description about the sovereign system of Babylonian kingdom at his time and by pointing that Blockbuster movie-like fire-showering on Sodom and Gomorrah, etc. \n.\nAnd they, the attackers, turned out to be wrong. Evidences are coming out of the underground buried cities day by day. Scientists even calculated the exact time and date of the doom's day of Sodom and Gomorrah, lol. (June 29, B.C. 3123. 5AM) Yes, it's the day after the day when Abraham said goodbye to the three angels he met in front of his tent.

I'm just appreciating they don't shoot the test missiles nowadays. That's all. We don't love North Korea. We're sick of them.\n.\n\\#1\n.\nYear 2019 is the 100 year anniversary for 3.1 Independence Movement Day (March. 1) on 1919 of Koreans against Empire of Japan which was governing Korea at that time. \n.\nThose songs were there since independence of Korea and lyrics are curses to Japan's imperial army at that time when they used to kidnap many Korean teenage girls to force them to work as sex slaves in their army camp. They're not about current Japan's army or something. \n.\n\\#2\n.\nJapanese war criminal companies have shown dirty movements to avoid to compensate many Korean labourers and army sex slaves who were forced under Japan's Empire government before 1945 Independence of Korea. \nThey even deny to make an official apology under the supervision of Abe cabinet.\n. \nThat law will keep Japanese war criminal companies from bidding Korea government procurement, but not for the private business sectors.\n.\n\\#3\n.\nJapan and Chinese Communists are well known liars and fabricators in regard with the history, it is necessary to point it out, but there's no such a stupidly titled law or something in Korea.

It's decentralized, but it doesn't matter even though being centralized, too, since every one who possesses the copy of the blockchain is a guarantor to guarantee the integrity of the data structure or transaction history of everyone involved in that blockchain.\n.\nThe reason why Zeronet is not blockchain is because each site itself is also a kind of someone's wallet (= site creator). Each site can be modified any moment by any one (at least only for each member's own occupied space among the group members in the same site) without keeping the previous history while blockchain keeps it. It's like that bitcoin wallet contents can be modified by the wallet owner any time, but that very action is always recorded and kept in the blockchain.\n.\nSo it means Zeronet is lack of a kind of Version Control feature which resembles blockchain.\n.\nBlockchain Phone means, anyone can become a cellphone network provider with virtual sim card tech as long as he/she has a capacity of using or leasing an existing network infrastructure or of building his/her own one while having an ability to deal with billing method based on blockchain tech. That means lowering phone bill or possibly zero phone bill if relating it to a kind of crypto currency or to goods or service exchanging market such as giving a bit of bandwidth of one's phone to the network provider or something. That can not be accomplished based on the traditional transaction system, or can be in a very clumsy and inefficient way.\n.\nBut as mentioned earlier in this thread, if we fully moved to voice over MESH network lifestyle, even blockchain related to somewhat centralized network which @Kaffie concerns would not be necessary, either. That's why I agreed \"Mesh net is the future of internet\".",
