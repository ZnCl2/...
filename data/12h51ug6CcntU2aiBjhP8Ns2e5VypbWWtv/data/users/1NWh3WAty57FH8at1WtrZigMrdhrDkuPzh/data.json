			"body": "Alright, so everything seems to be in order for my new awesome hub and cleanly migrating hubs for those of you who want to switch to my hub, or the infinity one (or even Red->Blue/Blue->Red for you color traitors).\n\nFirst things first is to seed the new hub you want to switch to. You're likely already seeding Red and Blue, but you'll need to seed the [Kaffie hub](http://127.0.0.1:43110/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv) or the infinity hub, if you want to switch to those. If you're seeing this post, you should already have the Kaffie hub.\n\nDon't bother going to the 'create profile' page. That's for suckers. It's nice to check which subs you're seeding, but the 'create profile' button just messes things up. Instead, go to your home sub (you can figure out what this is by hovering over your name and looking at the URL) and go into the /data/users/[your id]/ folder. You'll want to copy over this whole folder into the new hub's equivalent.\n\nIn the destination hub, open up content.json in a text editor (like sublime, so formatting doesn't get messed up). All you want to do is edit 'address' to point to the new hub, instead of your old one.\n\nNext, open up data.json in the destination hub. You'll see all your original hub data. Here's what we're going to do. Delete all of the entries under 'comments'. These are comments relating to the hub they're in, so you don't need them migrated. You should still keep the array though, since that's where all your new hub comments will go.\n\nChange the 'hub' to the new hub you're migrating to. Just like you did in the content.json. This is a reference to say what your 'home hub' is. We'll eventually edit this in EVERY hub you're seeding or posted in, but one step at a time.\n\nChange 'next_comment_id' to 1. Since we deleted the comments, we need to reset the counter.\n\nHere's where you get a choice. There's two options for your posts. Either you can migrate the data, which switches the name link on those posts (and hosts it in the new hub) but also unlink everyone's comments, or you can leave the posts in the old hub, and start fresh. If you start fresh, your old posts will still appear, but they'll link back to your old hub profile. So keep that in mind. I personally started fresh.\n\nTo start fresh, do the same thing to your posts as you did your comments. Delete all the entries and change the 'next_post_id' to 1.\n\nLastly, delete everything under 'post_like'. Keep the array though.\n\nThat should set up your new hub account. Now we need to repoint your data on the other hubs. For each hub you've posted in, go into that hub's folder and find your user folder, like we did before.\n\nOn each one, open the data.json and simply edit the 'hub' variable to point to your home hub. This is probably optional (as it repoints the comment links), but I went ahead and did it to reduce the amount of problems.\n\nOn your original sub, a couple more things need to be tweaked. Delete everything under 'follows'. Remove the variable entirely. Delete 'next_follow_id' as well. Change 'hub' to your new hub, as usual. And if you opted to migrate your posts, delete the entire 'posts' section along with the 'next_post_id' variable. If not, leave it. I didn't migrate, so I left the posts there.\n\nChange the intro to something to notify people to switch the profile they follow. This is technically optional, and you can just delete it if you feel like it. Delete the 'avatar' if you migrated posts (it's unneeded), but if you kept your posts there, then you'll want to keep it, as otherwise your old posts won't have an avatar (perhaps this is preferred?)\n\nFinally, we save up and go to sign/publish our changes. Visit each hub site (the actual site down at the bottom of zerohello, not zerome). Then drag the sidebar open and select 'i own this site'. Put your user content.json in the bottom box (should look something like: data/users/[yourid]/content.json) and hit sign. It'll prompt for a privatekey. Use your ZeroID private key (found at the top of your zeronet's user.json file) and then click publish. Do this for every hub you've edited.\n\n---\n\nSo now all of the changes are made and published. Everyone else should see everything just fine. But you might still be stuck logged into your old hub. So delete every hub but your destination hub. Then go into zerome and ensure you're logged in properly. Finally, redownload each hub and everything should be good to go!",

			"body": "Update on the login issue for KaffieID. The login code detects your cert name, which is the little `name@zeroid.bit` and then compares it to the one in your `content.json` file. If they match, it sets that as your user. If not, then it doesn't. So username switching systems, or people with matching names/providers (such as nanasi/kaffie that don't guarantee name uniqueness) you get login issues. And switching an id (even with the same auth keys and such) makes a login issue, despite signing working correctly anyway.\n\nApparently the only think you need to change is the content.json in your home hub, to fix this. just change `\"cert_user_id\": \"name@provider.bit\",` to whatever it is that is in the top right (your cert name). If this field is missing, there'll be issues. And if it doesn't match, there'll be issues.\n\nThe fix I posted below (changing the detection in all.js) to be based on auth_address) works as well, and lets you log in regardless (so if your signing is good, you're all set). Though amusingly, the little `name@provider.bit` that appears everywhere *is* based on that field in the content.json. Interesting...\n\nI'd still like the change to all.js to be made though, so that this issue doesn't occur. Having broken logins is never good.",

			"body": "So there's been signing/publishing issues issues with KaffieID and I seem to have found out why. When there's a cert_sign in the content.json, ZeroNet attempts to create a new cert to recreate the cert_sign to verify.\n\nHere's the relevant code:\n\n```\ndef verifyCert(self, inner_path, content):\n        from Crypt import CryptBitcoin\n\n        rules = self.getRules(inner_path, content)\n        if not rules.get(\"cert_signers\"):\n            return True  # Does not need cert\n\n        name, domain = content[\"cert_user_id\"].split(\"@\")\n        cert_address = rules[\"cert_signers\"].get(domain)\n        if not cert_address:  # Cert signer not allowed\n            self.log.error(\"Invalid cert signer: %s\" % domain)\n            return False\n        return CryptBitcoin.verify(\n            \"%s#%s/%s\" % (rules[\"user_address\"], content[\"cert_auth_type\"], name), cert_address, content[\"cert_sign\"]\n)\n```\n\nThis means that only certs that have signed using `useraddress#authtype/name` are valid. Which eliminates the ability to change names but keep the same cert. This verification requiring the name is entirely useless, and you can get around the entire issue by modifying the content.json to simply not have a cert_sign.\n\nSo... what should we do? Just force everyone to use the `useraddress#authtype/name` and hope that no one pushes out a cert that uses something different? KaffieID uses `useraddress#authtype/kaffie.bit` so that names can freely change. However, that seems to mess up the python verification. The cert works, it's just unexpected due to not using the name. Should I just change KaffieID to mess up certs when you change names? Seems kind of dumb that changing a name for an ID service would mess up your cert. I mean, we already have public/private keys. Is a specialized cert_sign in a particular format that breaks if you change names necessary?\n\nAlternatively we can look a bit further on what's actually going on behind the scenes, and perhaps fix it entirely? Perhaps certs should have a 'format' for the verification to take place?\n\n@nofish: I'm interested to see what you have to say. At the moment the cert_sign appears to me as a redundant check that breaks certs that use different formatting. Why not simply change the check to `useraddress#authtype/signersite`? Is there even a way to change this now that people have been using ZeroIDs? Would the 'format' option I described work?",

The big issue seems to be that there's no way to get the magnet link/torrent file from a video, meaning you can only ever seed it when you're on the page. And uploading is really glitchy, so if you use the direct thing, you're shit outta luck.\n\nI went ahead and mirrored some videos (Cosmos Laundromat, Fastcast vids, etc) as well as uploaded a new one of my own (Deadpool movie). For those who want to just manually upload stuff, here's my process:\n\n1. Drag/drop the movie into webtorrent. This is to start the seeding process. Don't include anything besides the mp4. Webms don't work, and I'm guessing stuff like AVIs don't work either.\n\n2. Right click on the newly seeded torrent and hit 'copy magnet link'. You'll paste this in the 'magnet' field on your data.json.\n\n3. Add a new video in your data.json. Here's the format:\n\n```\n{\n\"video_id\": \"\",\n\"title\": \"\",\n\"description\": \"\",\n\"magnet\": \"\",\n\"date_added\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nFor 'video_id', it's expecting the bittorrent hash listed under 'bith'. It's in the magnet link near the beginning. For date_added, my new entries have the format `2016-08-29T02:12:14.588Z`. (Edit: You can use [this site](http://www.unixtimestamp.com/) to generate a timestamp. Use the 'ISO 8601' one.)\n\nHave fun. Still no way to increase the seeds besides manually sharing the magnet link and downloading through webtorrent (or staying on the page). You can grab a video's magnet link in the same manner. Alternatively you can grab the bith from the end of the watching URL, and paste that right into webtorrent desktop.\n\nAnd remember, the more support ZeroTube gets, the more webtorrents are seeded for *any* webtorrent video service. So let's work together to kickstart a solid video streaming platform for ZeroNet :D\n\nEdit: Help mirror youtube videos by pasting the url into this site http://keepvid.com/ and then hitting the 'Download MP4 - 720p' option.",

With dropbox gone, we really need a reliable webseed if we want P2P video sharing to take off. I'm not sure how long Peerify hosts videos for, so that's the point of this test. I've moved all my videos over for now, instead of just having me seed them 24/7. Hopefully this works better.\n\nI've also been trying to figure out how to rip video from [Bitchute](https://www.bitchute.com/) which relies on webtorrent and uses it's own webseeding server. However, there seems to be a CORS restriction or something that messes up the webseeding for anyone else. Kind of defeats the purpose of having it a torrent if no one else can help share the video. Amusingly, popping in the link into webtorrent desktop lets it stream just fine. So maybe it's a ZeroNet issue?\n\nEither way, I hope people *finally* start uploading some videos. The process is *real* simple now. Just upload your video on Peerify, copy the link, and paste that in KopyKate, being sure that the uploaded link is the .torrent, rather than the converted magnet link. From there, you can personally help seed by copying the KopyKate magnet into your own webtorrent desktop app.\n\nAlso, if anyone knows about other places that are big users of webtorrent, please mention where you saw it, as we can piggyback off their content.",

Though, the scalpers were nice enough to keep the domains pointed at my zites. So they'll work for the foreseeable future until they're sold/used/expired&renewed/etc.\n\nBesides that, I don't have an income so I wouldn't be able to afford to keep doing it. And Namecoin also puts a sort of centralization on ZN, and requires connection to the current internet in order to function properly. These also contributed to my decision to stop using namecoin entirely.\n\nIt's a cute system to help give domain names to ZN sites, but this isn't the solution. Tor Onion Addresses don't need names, so why should ZN sites? Links and portals seem good enough to get the job done, along with a customizeable display name for your homepage.\n\nReserving a particular word for a particular website seems to be a flawed system in general, and just promotes a need to have a way of providing ownership over tokens. Which isn't something I'd like to support.\n\n---\n\nWhat does this mean for ZeroNet and my network of sites? Ideally y'all shouldn't notice a difference unless you're directly typing my site names into your browser. The clickable links on ZeroHello will naturally change to remove the domain name.

It's hard to tell whether it's a legitimate chinese person's frustration, gov propaganda, etc. But one thing it made me realize is that there actually *is* western propaganda against China. If you believe the reports, of course, it's easy to dislike China. And even our few interactions with what we believe to be the chinese government.... weren't ever confirmed such.\n\nIs there a possibility that the \"poor attempts\" of the chinese gov to censor, squash criticism, etc. are actually done by western organizations? We're lead to believe China is a technological superpower, capable of tracking citizens with advanced facial recognition, gesture recognition, etc. software. Along with a complicated \"credit\" system that dictates control. But if that's the case, why when it comes to the censorship attempts does all that technological progress boil down to \"zeronet is a shit\"? At the time I kinda just laughed it off, but it really struck my core as something being off. This sort of incompetency isn't what you'd expect from a technological superpower.\n\nWe see the same trend with north korea. Despite their impressive built cities, their impressive military displays, custom gnu/linux distro, excellent propaganda pieces for western consumption.... they seem hilariously incompetent at actually managing the perception of themselves.\n\nWe see this trend again with Russia. World superpower, yet somehow unable to make a proper internet presence and influence viewpoints? We're lead to believe that any opposition to the US elite narratives is somehow russian meddling. We see their news organizations (RT) do solid work, sometimes better than western media. But again, somehow their image is solidly trashed and they seem to have no appearance? Both the left and right seem to hate Russia, as well as China and North Korea.\n\nThere's something really unnerving about the sheer incompetency, yet striking propaganda pieces by their \"enemies\" that has been happening and appears to be a global trend. We know here in the US our politicians are a bunch of buffoons who can't do much right.\n\nIt just seems really suspicious how all of the worlds leaders are seemingly so incompetent they can't manage their own countries, yet we're lead to believe they have a tight grip on everything? Which is it? What is the incentive in inflaming these narratives?\n\nIf Russian And Chinese users could comment and share their thoughts that'd really be great. It's hard to get a clear view while digging through American propaganda, and naturally I'm in california where a huge portion of this shit comes from.\n\n I'll repost the youtube comment here for discussion:\n\n>我们是东亚病夫时，我们被说是黄祸； \n\n>When we were the sick man of Asia, we were called the yellow peril. \n\n>我们被预言是下一个超级大国了，我们被指是主要威胁。 \n\n>When we are billed to be the next superpower, we are called the threat. \n\n>那时我们闭关自守，你走私鸦片来强开门户； \n\n>When we closed our doors, you smuggled drugs to open markets. \n\n>我们拥抱自由贸易了，你责骂我们抢走你的饭碗。 \n\n>When we embrace free trade, you blame us for taking away your jobs. \n\n>那时我们风雨飘摇，你铁蹄犯境要求机会均等;\n\n>When we were falling apart, you marched in your troops and wanted your fair share. \n\n>我们要整合破碎的山河，你说我们“入侵”…… \n\n>When we tried to put the broken pieces back together again, free Tibet you screamed, It was an invasion! \n\n>我们试行马列救国，你痛恨我们成为异己分子; \n\n>When tried communism, you hated us for being communist. \n\n>我们拥抱资本主义了，你又恨我们当了资本家。 \n\n>When we embrace capitalism, you hate us for being capitalist. \n\n>当我们的人口到达十亿，你说我们在摧毁地球; \n\n>When we have a billion people, you said we were destroying the planet. \n\n>我们要限制人口了，你说我们践踏人权。 \n\n>When we tried limiting our numbers, you said we abused human rights. \n\n>那时我们一贫如洗，你视我们贱如狗; \n\n>When we were poor, you thought we were dogs. \n\n>我们有钞票借给你了，你怨我们令你国债累累。 \n\n>When we loan you cash, you blame us for your national debts. \n\n>我们发展工业了，你说我们是污染者; \n\n>When we build our industries, you call us polluters.\n\n>我们有货品卖给你了，你说我们是地球暖化的因由。 \n\n>When we sell you goods, you blame us for global warming. \n\n>我们购买石油，你说我们榨取兼灭族; \n\n>When we buy oil, you call it exploitation and genocide. \n\n>你们为石油开战，你说是为了解救生灵。 \n\n>When you go to war for oil, you call it liberation. \n\n>那时我们动乱无序，你说我们没有法治; \n\n>When we were lost in chaos and rampage, you demanded rules of law. \n\n>现在我们要依法平暴，你说我们违反人权。 \n\n>When we uphold law and order against violence, you call it violating human rights. \n\n>我们静默无声时，你说我们欠缺言论自由; \n\n>When we were silent, you said you wanted us to have free speech. \n\n>我们不再缄默了，你说我们是被洗了脑的仇外暴民。 \n\n>When we are silent no more, you say we are brainwashed-xenophobes. \n\n>\"为什么你这样憎恨我们？\"我们想知道。 \n\n>“Why do you hate us so much﹖”we asked. \n\n>“不”，你说，“我不恨你们。” \n\n>“No,” you answered, “we don't hate you.” \n\n>我们也不恨你，只是，你了解我们吗? \n\n>We don't hate you either, but, do you understand us? \n\n>“当然了解”，你说，“我们消息多的是，有 AFP、CNN、还有BBC……” \n\n>“Of course we do, ”you said, “We have AFP, CNN and BBC's ……” \n\n>那么你究竟要我们怎样生存? \n\n>What do you really want from us? \n\n>回答之前，请仔细的想一想… 因为你的机会不是无限的。 \n\n>Think hard first, then answer, because you only get so many chances. \n\n>已经够多了…这个世界容不下更多的伪善了。 \n\n>Enough is enough, enough hypocrisy for this one world. \n\n>我们要的是同一个世界，同一个梦想，靖世太平。 \n\n>We want one world, one dream, and peace on earth. \n\n>这个宽广、辽阔的蓝地球，容得下你们，容得下我们。 \n\n>This big blue earth is big enough for all of us. \n\n>美国，日本是发达国家，我不知道台湾叫自己是什么，不过中国从零到开始从废墟中站起来连百年都不到，养活14亿人不算还要跟老牌列强比物质生活比福利，这就叫中国奇迹。﻿",

			"body": "I'm really curious about the spiritual ontology of others, but it seems my questioning and poking around in others' psyche is unwelcome. Either due to the unspoken implication of my questioning and research, or perhaps the willful ignorance that people have been lulled into.\n\nAs it stands there appears to be a racial origin for two distinct kinds of spiritual ontology of humans. One which we can call hylic, and the other pneumatic. Pneumatics seem to have an ancestral origin specifically within the fertile crescent. The pneumatic ontology includes:\n\nThe physical body+brain which is external to the self and is controlled through imitative qualitative experiential imagery.\n\nThe mind or soul which is where such imagery appears and operates as a mid layer, this is where the pneumatic self appears to be located. It is a middle layer that is neither fully material nor fully spiritual.\n\nAnd lastly what is called the spirit, or the \"higher self\". It's also been referred to as the divine spark. This is largely inaccessible to the pneumatic self, but can be deduced and inferred upon study in other areas (symbolic magic, quantum physics, special relativity, neuroscience, etc.). This is where the true pneumatic self lies, even though it's not immediately apparent. This is because the spirit actualizes the middle layer soul, which creates such an illusion. But the spirit, unlike the soul, is entirely divorced from the physical world.\n\nThe spiritual ontology of hylics is a topic which I'm unable to investigate due to not being hylic myself. My research so far seems to suggest that hylics only contain the most external outer physical layer.\n\nIn terms of racial origin, pneumatics mostly consist of mediterranean people, with an exception for some british people I have spoken to. For hylics it's the reverse: more or less everywhere else unrelated to mediterranean people.\n\nWhile it may seem surprising, this is *not* actually a new fact or discovery. It's been known at least as early as 300ad, and likely earlier (as texts claim that Jesus spoke about it). Likewise, these two conflicting spiritual ontologies appear to stretch back further than that into the earliest religious writings.\n\nIn a more formal field we can see that the idea of qualia and philosophical zombies have been around for quite some time as well. Interestingly, it's a topic that the political elites wish to cover up, going to the extent of killing off all supporters of religions that have this idea, along with burning all of the related texts. Ancient christianity was actually hijacked, and a fake version was pushed as the official religion, which many people still follow today (which claims the exact opposite of the finding I'm talking about).\n\nNowadays it seems there are two major religious beliefs being pushed: the secular atheistic one in which no one has a spiritual ontology that expands past the physical body, and the mainstream religious one in which every single person has an ontology similar to the pneumatic one I outlined above.",

Specifically against our favorite candidate, Andrew Yang.\n\nSpecifically he held a speech at the [Everytown Gun Sense Forum in Iowa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9lXId8oSQA) and did quite well. News reported two noteworthy events, one in which he was pretty emotional after a personal story someone gave about knowing someone who was a victim of gun violence. You can see that in the clip. the other was supposedly Yang saying some rude shit about trump's physique, which you can see is *not* in the video.\n\nSo the MSM put up some deepfakes. [NBC's deepfake here.](https://twitter.com/mickifahner/status/1160420159955394560) In a twitter thread. There's another upload [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYvEdlMcKC8) that's the same and credits micki fahner (the twitter user who posted the NBC fakes). You can see that it's a different stage, lacking chairs and including a flag and podium.\n\nThere's also [this ABC clip](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/trump-hot-air-balloon-grounded-fat-yang-64908481) which came later, and is zoomed in to hide the surrounding environment, podium, and flag to the right. But in the clip you can still see the flag. This version is much closer to the original claimed speech, and will likely get passed off as such.\n\nThere's no full video giving context to these clips, because they're very clearly faked. Attempts to ask for the source leads to bans on the official yang subreddit, and I imagine on other platforms as well. After all, we can't question the narrative, can we?\n\nFor comparison, [here is a deepfake of obama, doing the same thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ54GDm1eL0) In this deepfake (revealed at the end) effectively the same thing was done: calling trump a dipshit.\n\nYang has also removed his policy on fake news and having an information ombudsman (to call out deepfakes).\n\n[Webarchive of this policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20190318012658/https://www.yang2020.com/policies/news-information-ombudsman/)\n\n[Page now.](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/news-information-ombudsman/)",

			"body": "Found out there's a third type of \"deepfake\" that I hadn't really known about. The underlying tech is actually a bit unrelated and is called \"pix2pix\". Essentially what it does is it takes in a source template, and a pre-made learned style data, and applies the style to the source. So for instance you can make artwork into different styles, or make complete photo-realistic drawings out of a quick sketch. Or the more terrifying application: make photos of people look like other photos of people.\n\nI had seen things like https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ https://www.thiscatdoesnotexist.com/ and https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/ but I never really thought past the implications of it. I saw the *video* versions of this sort of thing (applying a source content to a premade video style) but didn't really realize a generative version for photos could work.\n\nThere is also full body generation ( https://datagrid.co.jp/all/release/386/ ).\n\nSo here's the scary part, such technology can be used to change clothing style or effectively create nudes of people. So sort of like the oldest deepfake tech, but in reverse. Instead of swapping the face you're swapping the clothes. IE stripping the person in the photo. So naturally I was horribly curious and it was kinda easy to set up for me. And I got to work taking pics of myself seeing what the extent was and how far it could go. I also tried some professional shots in various stages of undress, along with some amateur photos (to test low quality).\n\nAnd the results are kinda..... mixed. Things like professional photoshoots in bikinis and light clothing work shockingly well, though there's some artifacting (you can tell its a fake in every case). In certain cases, both amateur and professional, the quality was well above what I've seen certain porn end up at, and the results looked realistic.\n\nIt *also* worked quite well even for people fully clothed. It was able to remove things like leggings but having notable blur/distortion along the legs. Shorts and t-shirts were removed fine. For tops it worked best with midriff showing, rather than having it covered up (it uses the navel to help align/detect). Long tops (tunics and such), dresses, and skirts all obscure the pelvic area and as a result have poor results, especially if the naval is also covered.\n\nMy own photos.... didn't go so well. My fully clothed photos ended up horribly disorted or improperly detected (my camera is low quality and I dress modestly). One photo I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans and it properly stripped, ending up with blurred legs, along with some distortion on the added nudity. Trying in underwear it ends up removing panties, but it was having difficulties with my bra, and worked better if I removed that entirely (ie just having it remove panties). It altered my breast size and never actually detected it properly, though it matched my and others' skin tone properly in every photo. Though some of the photos I took from online were altered as if there was a color filter over it.\n\nTL;DR: Despite this seeming scary, it's actually not that bad. Just avoid skin-tight clothes and anything revealing (ie swimwear/undies). Though in the future this could be horrifying, specifically if it becomes popular or widespread. Especially since on my crappy old laptop the photos took less than a minute to create.\n\n[Example Image (clearnet)](https://i.imgur.com/dsuZ8Wu.jpg)\n\nI'm linking to this example image of a 3D modeled character as an example of the capabilities and the various steps the software does.

Namely we need a way to easily manage the 'hub' variable, as well as use that solely for identifying which hub you're on. At the moment, it doesn't seem to work like that, and causes problems.\n\nCross-hub posting works fine, the comments are placed in the hub you're commenting in like they should. If your comments on my hub were placed in a different hub, I wouldn't be able to see them.\n\nIn reality, what we need is a profile page being determined solely by the 'hub' variable, and the posts to be fetched from a 'posted hubs' list (like a new variable listing the hubs you've posted in. This list would be fetched from the home hub.). I think that'd solve all the problems.\n\nEdit: As it is now, the URL defines which hub to load for your profile.

Likes don't need an id, because you can't like a like.

It's the ZeroMe frontend that causes the issues. Since it glitches with posts from multiple hubs (easy fix is to just check the hubs). And it also relies on the url to determine which hub your login/posts are in, which causes glitches (again, easy fix, just use the 'hub' variable in literally every hub data folder). That, and there's no 'migrate hub' button. Instead there's just a 'join hub', which deletes some data and such, and obviously that messes things up. It also doesn't switch the hub variable, or fix other things that could cause glitches.\n\nAfter those two things are fixed (in the ZeroMe site itself), then it should work fine. A ZeroMe clone could certainly be used for clean migrations. Amusingly, the old zerome would still support the migrated account, due to how things work. But it'd still run into the same glitches as it is now (duplicate likes, login issues, following old profiles, etc.).",

A proper account migration would leave the comments there, and correctly distinguish between posts made on different hubs. If you're censored on a hub, you can only migrate *your* content (comments and posts). Not anyone else's.\n\n>\"IMO, comments (posted by others) and likes should be in the sub folder of the user, which makes the user can control all of the comments and likes,\"\n\nComments and likes are posted on the appropriate hub that they refer to. I imagine that was by design, so that red hub users can see posts made on the red hub. Otherwise, you'd have to have every hub to see people's comments. Unless you meant comments posted by others going into your (OP) folder. Which is impossible, due to the way that ZeroNet authentication works. There's no way to touch another user's content. Period.\n\nAt best we keep it how it is, but correct the posts linkage issue (by relating comments/likes to same hub posts, and make a user's profile only ever link back to what's listed in the 'hub' entry).\n\n>\"All my comments posted to sub folder of an user in other hubs should be also backuped to my profile's hub and backup hubs in case of something unexpected happen.\"\n\nI wasn't even aware this was a possibility. The only issue I can see here is that other people's comments would increase your folder size and more quickly reach your cap. But it *is* a good solution for migrating comments as well.",

It started blocking the entire page and prompted to allow `http://zero` so I did, and the page loaded fine. The test then displayed pass for http://zero/, but fail for zero://. I can't seem to modify the script in such a way that makes http://zero/ fail with no script but pass without.\n\nCould you clarify what the problem is, exactly? The .pac should override `http://zero/[address]` and it should work fine. Are you resolving those addresses in a different manner?\n\nThe test by default displays 'fail' until it can run the two tests. The http://zero/ test involves a jquery ajax request to fetch a page from `http://zero/kaffie.bit/test.txt`. The zero:// test involves loading an iframe with the url `zero://1A83ijw3boqTtqdLz8me7AqeK1nEK8yxeu/test.html?zp&prtl=[origin]` and ZeroNet forcefully moves the iframe content to the main page (by reloading). This leads to the success of the second test.\n\nIf the first one isn't working, it sounds like either the jquery isn't being ran, or it's not grabbing the file. Perhaps check the console and let me know if there's an error?",

I simply added the singersite to make it distinguishably different from KaffieID clones.\n\nI'm unsure of which way we should proceed. Forcing users to keep the same name to ensure the cert_sign is the same is dumb. It's not required at all (signs can be verified with just authaddress and authtype). I'm still entirely unsure of the purpose of including it. Why not just remove it from the content.json?\n\nThe files won't be accepted anyway if you don't have the user's private key.

Everything is signed according to auth_address and your private key.\n\nCertificates have a few things to distinguish them: the site it's issued from, the user's public and private key. The type of authentication. The username, and the cert_sign. The cert_sign is reconstructed on each users' machine following the formula given. And then compared to the one included in content.json (which is a copy of the one that the site provides). However, there's no guarantee the site will use said formula, and thus the publish is rejected despite having the private key correct.\n\nTo bypass this, you remove the auth_type and cert_sign provided in the content.json. Now that these are lacking, the cert_sign check is skipped and it just verifies that the private key was used and signed the stuff correctly.\n\nSo the cert_sign is entirely unneeded. It can be removed manually, and doesn't help authenticate anything. So I'm wondering why bother having it?

The downloading isn't perfect yet (no downloads from netease), the merging is still a mess. And there's no easy way to manage your catalogue. No importing/uploads/whatever, as it's just a stream+download tool at the moment. I want to throw in a thing to log the data viewed into a database of some sort. Initially I thought maybe sending that to a hosted DB somewhere would work, but I want users to have access to it, and to not have the DB swarmed. I made a crawler for Xiami, but I haven't written stuff for logging just yet. I've mostly just worked on it off/on for the past while now. Xiami changed things up mid-dev, so I had to spend a lot of time fixing it. And netease seems to constantly shift their cdn stuff, which makes it keep breaking.\n\n@Icf20: Looks like that's just ripping from youtube. Won't work for my purposes.\n\n@Johnhamelink: I've seen beets, and it seems like it grabs from the usual sources :\\\\. I haven't seen the mopidy stuff though. I'll have to look into it.",

Once that's done, I should be able to write a plugin for *any* music source that provides a few basic features (search, grab albums by artist, grab tracks by album, etc.) I was actually wondering if I could implement it with IPFS/ZeroNet, so that when people listen to tracks and dl info, it automatically adds it to zn/ipfs so that it's accessible even without the 3rd party sites. But as I said, I don't really have a plan yet for migrating away from these sites (and they've screwed things up in the past).",

The links go to their ZeroMe page. The data (which spans every ZeroMe user) is currently about 700kb, but I'm trying to trim it down since that's 7x larger than the sites index! 7285 users were pulled.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a way to just do this live in the browser, rather than use python tools like I'm doing now.

Those can be found if you click on 'scripts' or check out the Kaffiene github repo. For the ZeroMe profiles, it's a new script I wrote (not pushed yet), that once again fetches them and compiles them into a document for searching.\n\nI'm wondering if there's a way to do the ZeroMe profiles with just javascript, so I don't have to focus on updating, like how the various off-site indexes work. I'd need access to the merged-zerome/zerome.db database to do so. But that's pretty big at 30mb for mine (with all the hubs) whereas the profile index is at only 700kb.\n\nThe \"backend\" is just me haha. No fancy bots/crawlers/taggers/whatever yet. That's on the agenda and why Kaffiene's index hasn't been updated in months. If you check the dropdown menu you can look at the untagged sites the scripts found. I don't have a way of automatically tagging them yet. That's a WIP. Once I get that done though it'll be smooth sailing.",

It's not a separate file or anything, and thus when compiled will still result in filesize bloat.\n\nWhat I'd *like* to do is be able to simply read another site's merged db. That'd make it real easy. The other problem with making it a zerome merger site is that part of my future plans for Kaffiene involve moving the search indexes over to a hub system so that people can merely download and contribute to different hubs to get a more personalized search.

It ain't perfect, but it works real well if all you want is some simple movie lookup/browser streaming. Let me know if there's any issues. The site uses a hack to escape ZeroNet's iframe, and exposes your browser to clearnet servers, so there's a disclaimer and a 'launch' button on the main page. Hopefully that's not an issue for anyone but it *does* make the site a bit more clunky.\n\nMovie lookup pulls from IMDB, posters/backdrop from themoviedb.org and the streams themselves from vodlocker.to (mostly hosted on google it seems). I've been playing around with it for a while and it works great. Full screen works fine, movies load quick, and there's a huge selection (though the site will still display movies that are unavailable). Vodlocker advertises chromecast support, but I've never seen the option.",

Anyway, it's all [here](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) which is where google shows you the info they have on you. Kinda creepy if you aren't aware of some of it. But a lot of it is standard fare: google searches, voice queries, etc. As I said, what creeped *me* out wasn't that stuff (though it was a bit creepy/weird seeing it all together like that), it was the *app usage*. That is \"Kaffie used app X at time Y\". And you can filter out the other stuff to just show app usage. So it'd look something like this:\n\n8:00am - used Clock app\n8:10am - used google news app\n8:30am - used clash of clans\n9:14am - used period tracker\n9:20am - used gmail\n9:30am - used discord\n\nAnd so on. That's obviously just a fake history (I deleted my own and disabled tracking). Very creepy. But indeed, it stopped displaying on that page once I disabled all the options. I also switched my launcher for good measure. As for whether I explicitly enabled it... no. I was not aware of any such tracking. I knew my *web results* would be tracked if I used google. And I knew that gmail, google news, and the like would be tracked. I also knew the voice thing would be tracked. But regular app usage? Even when offline? How the hell would I know that's tracked?\n\nUpon researching, the *actual* option is \"web and app activity\" or something like that. Meaning you can't have it track the web stuff for personalization and still keep your privacy when it comes to apps. Given I had no idea it was even tracked, I'm skeptical disabling it actually disables tracking. Like, perhaps they just don't show me it >_>",

The index format? That wasn't me at all (except the addition of siterank).\n\n@Jayofthezero: It previously used an XMLHttpRequest to fetch the .db file from ZeroWiki, and then searched through it. However, now it uses the new remote fileget and cors permission to fetch the file. You can check it out on the [Github](https://github.com/April93/Kaffiene/blob/master/index.html#L25). Or just looking at the first few lines of index.html in the kaffiene folder.\n\nThere's a lot of parsing and formatting to make the results good. You can find that in the [fetchfromdb()](https://github.com/April93/Kaffiene/blob/master/index.html#L134) function. Located a bit later down.",

Using Tor as an excuse makes it sound like ZeroNet will never move to a meshnet. Is that the case? Seems like a horrible waste, tying the entire project to a particular technology.\n\nIf we could manually enter a bootstrap node, and then run things over DHT/Peer-exchange, and let it run over IPV6, and *many* mesh projects can start using ZeroNet. Perhaps it's just me, but I see meshnets as the natural evolution and home for ZeroNet. Not tied and competing with an internet that will outperform it every time.\n\nIt's clear Tor isn't going anywhere. It's gonna be stuck on the regular ISP-dominated internet. And if that's where ZeroNet is remaining, I'm afraid I can't really put my efforts into promoting and supporting it. It's kinda just this whole weight attached to it.\n\nEven if it's not in the official plans, what exactly is required to implement in order to achieve this? If it's straight forward then even better. I'm honestly wondering at this point if I should bother waiting, or move on and find different tech to use on meshes.

A diet rich in beans, nuts, dark leafy greens, and lots of veggies and fruit will give you all the nutrition you need.\"\n\nDoesn't really seem like a problem to me. I hardly eat meat as it is.",

He *can* touch the front-end site which I use, but if that happens I can hop over to some other ZeroMe frontend site and continue enjoying zerome without any influence from nofish.

You can simply ignore the warning and dl the site anyway.\n\nBut yeah, I'm wary of following user mutelists that don't have a clear reason. Like the \"nope\" list. Like wtf counts as \"nope\"? Spam is pretty clear. I'd like to see something like that for users who post pedophilic content. The problem is that the mutelists end up getting a variety of shit in there.\n\nI have other users I mute, but they aren't spammers so I didn't include them in the list.\n\nIf you're uncomfortable following the lists, you can always see the list of accounts and the reason given for the mute.

And people can obviously submit pull requests to the zeronet github (at which point nofish needs to confirm and merge if he accepts the changes).\n\nFor example, a lot of the ipv6 work was done by someone else, and nofish just put some finishing touches on it and merged it in.

And have mute lists *prevent downloading* of the muted user's content (this is key).\n\n2. Have more sites, and not funnel all new users into the same handful of sites. This will reduce the size of the target. As of now, if zerotalk gets spammed, that's the only place people chat so it makes it a mess. But if there were hundreds of different forums, all given equal weight? Well then one forum spammed isn't a huge issue (it's only an issue for that forum).\n\nAnd with spamming basically being futile in a larger system, the incentive will naturally decrease. At least, that's the theory. So combining those two will likely solve the problem (and does for people who don't really care to spam other than some basic shitposting).",

Performance-wise I've never had an issue except when trying to run graphically intense games. My biggest issue has been drive space (128gb ssd isn't nearly enough for modern bloated OS's) and ram for some reason (my mac has started killing programs randomly to make room). Never had an issue with performance.\n\n>And don't get me started with that lightning plug.\n\nI don't use it. I hook everything up through USB and SD. The power cable works fine and has for the entire 6 years I've had the laptop. Though the cord near the connector has started fraying and it doesn't seem like there's a cheap replacement. The connector itself is lovely and has saved my laptop quite a few times thanks to the magnet connection. I wish all laptop power adapters worked like that.\n\n>Linux is not perfect but it is far better than a Mac. \n\nLinux isn't hardware, which is where most of your complaints were. Obviously you can install linux on apple/mac hardware. Generally speaking, I like the linux ideology/philosophy, but can't in practice end up switching to it. Hence my question. I have my own issues with mac, but they haven't been enough to drive me away.",

Then there's the social issues and relationship issues.\n\nIt's all horribly demotivating. It's just becoming very clear that there's not really anything I can do to fix pretty much any of my personal problems, nor the problems I see with society at large (thanks for complimenting my ideas :3).\n\nI hate to be narcissistic but the problem largely isn't with myself, though my medical problems are things that appear unfixable and give me problems. But rather with society and my place within it. Along with my inability to really get myself out of this pseudoprison of poverty.\n\nNow more than ever I understand what prisoners go through mentally, and has reaffirmed my views that such a thing is incredibly harmful to the psyche. For those concerned, I likely won't be killing myself any time soon, despite my thoughts of it. Namely this is due to a lack of a way to do so, but also a bit of my own cowardice. My continual failures have made me realize that a DIY approach to suicide will also likely end in failure, making my already miserable existence worse than it already is.\n\nFor those of you who wish to help financially, I *do* have a patreon account.

Moving elsewhere it's hard to say until I know the living costs. Usually I think it's about $1k-1.5k/month? Something like that?\n\nI do need to undergo a $30k surgery which may or may not be covered by healthcare, sometime in the future (ideally sooner, but it's not a pressing or time-sensitive issue). And have about $24-30k in student loan debt. I don't expect y'all to fund either of those, but I'm sharing for transparency.\n\n$100,000 would be more than enough to cover the debt, the surgery, and still have enough for long-term medical treatments.

I usually eat when I wake up, and then around 5-7pm, snack through the night. What I eat varies per day.

While there *is* overlap when you get to \"gender neutral\" type games (that are neither overtly masculine nor feminine), most of the industry sticks to a masculine approach (go ahead and count the number of AAA games that lack any sort of violence).

Normally this relies on a centralized back-end server to guarantee username uniqueness. However with KaffieID I just have the site's key publicly on the site, so they can sign their cert themselves, allowing any name to be signed without guarantee of uniqueness. This gives it the benefit of being able to be used in an entirely decentralized manner.\n\nIt's possible to simply have the same solution per-site, but that eliminates the convenience of a single address per user, along with makes it difficult to have consistency between sites. It also adds more work for site devs.\n\nAdding KaffieID support is identical to adding ZeroID support (and you can support both very easily). So it makes everything very convenient. KaffieID itself is cloneable as well, in case you want to use something else that's similar.\n\nTechnically speaking, KaffieID is entirely unneeded if ZeroNet would allow creating and direct posting from auth-addresses without needing a cert provider. Things like bitcoin and other cryptocurrency do just that. But I think it's nice that it has a name attached as well.

			"body": ">Does .bit mean a single point of failure?\n\nYes. Like all blockchains, namecoin is prone to a centralization of invested wealthy parties, and a reliance on centralized internet infrastructure. Any system that guarantees name uniqueness suffers from this problem. For example if we turned zeroids into domains (which is actually a thing that has been done in the past). There's still a centralized manner of guaranteeing names are unique. Non-legible names (the raw addresses) are unique but lack legibility. This is a known problem of decentralization. The .bit fetching of names is done on your local machine, as it fetches it from the zeroname website (which has a centralized backend that updates from namecoin). You can configure zeronet to use a local instance of namecoin, if you prefer it.\n\n>if i promote my site by mentioning its .bit address and then will not renew the .bit name, people will fail to access my site and many will NOT even find the zite \"internal\"/real address \n\nZN is currently configured so that if the namecoin domain expires, the registry still maintains the entry until someone else purchases the name and uses it for a new ZN site. This is happened to my network of sites. My domains expired and were immediately bought by others, but not ZN users, so the names still point to my site, but without my control.\n\n>From decentralization and distributed point of view it appear to me like it is better NOT to use .bit name and promote site with internal address like 127.0.0.1:43110/15psKMf7iWZNdos5iKNQRTwu31hXEM9gFi ?\n\nYes, that's the ideal, though it's a bit inelegant. If someone visits your site through the .bit, its stored via the actual raw address. So if your name is compromised, you can just instruct your site to not rely on it, and users will still have your site accessible via the raw address.\n\n>If there are any work arounds? I appreaciate if you explain it. Thank You\n\nNo. There's a plugin for ZN that allow you to use zeroid names as domain names. Since your zeroid is unique and tied to a particular address, you can make a DNS registry on that address to get subdomains. This avoids a centralized blockchain, but relies on a uniqueness-guaranteed ID provider (which in tern requires a centralized backend).\n\nZooko's triangle. Look it up.",

Like someone is giving me the answers to things. In others it's hard to intentionally call up and bring about what I mean to think about. For example if I intentionally try to remember or recall a fact about some history thing or some detail I learned a while back, it might be difficult. Something like \"what's the capital of alaska?\" would be hard. But other times I'll see/hear something and instantly I'm presented with many related concepts and ideas that are connected in a variety of ways. It's harder to put the connection thing into worse. So to use schizophrenia for example, I think about it, then I'm presented with ideas like schizophrenics having unique views, shamans/witches/etc. are on the fringe of society, there's wisepeople who have arcane special knowledge and perspectives, gods who were venerated as having special powers, jewish chosen people, hitler's aryan master race, hitler and himmler were into occultism and magic, jews/nonjews had a serpent bloodline theory, o- blood type, harvesting blood to use in \"hospitals\", regenerative harvesting found in sci-fi media, vampirism, etc.\n\nAnd the thread goes on and it's easy to pull up the connected ideas. At some points I have a unique \"spiritual\" state of mind where it's like I withdraw from the physical world and enter a trance where this sort of thinking becomes hyperfocused. Beliefs and ideas start popping out in a similar fashion. So I'll suddenly know deep secrets about the universe, such as how there's particular unknown figures controlling the half of the universe that I (and my half) don't control, or how there's boundaries we never reach due to how mathematical patterns of behaviors and actions influence events. I'll magically know things like how people have connected thoughts and operate as one meta egregore entity.\n\nI'm not in the \"delusional\" state right now, so it's a bit difficult for me to pull up an example. But hopefully that kinda clarifies it. Over time even my regular default state has been gaining these \"abilities\".",

Masculine female gamers tend to just have all the same preferences as guys without any real significant difference. The feminine group largely isn't into gaming as a hobby, other than individual titles that end up catching mass appeal (animal crossing, love nikki, mystic messenger, otomes, etc). There's a vanishingly tiny minority like myself who are in the feminine camp, but ultimately are still heavily invested in gaming. I'd like to try and convert more of the \"certain games are fun but gaming isn't for me\" group into people like myself: girls who like feminine games and are hungry for more.
