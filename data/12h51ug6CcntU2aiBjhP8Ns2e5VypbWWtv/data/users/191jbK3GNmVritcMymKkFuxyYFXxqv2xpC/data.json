On top of that there's plenty of users who don't need Tor but still value the option of using it being there (eg. they are worried about the future state of internet freedom in their countries). Sure, when things get worse the other networks might start implementing anonymization, but being ahead of the rest on that front is definitely a plus.\n.\n@FraYoshi: True, comparing ZeroNet and IPFS is unfair to both as they solve different problems. I was thinking about Dat/Beaker for my comparison.",

No authoritarian shits to tell you what you can or can't say.\nThe owner of a zite can ban people from it, and each user can block users (or use blocklists made by others) to get rid of whatever it is they don't like. Let the crazies shut themselves in their echochambers. If the owner of a zite becomes censorious you could clone it and start a new one, or you could make a plugin that downloads \"blocked\" ids files anyway.
