My opinion on \"p-zombie argument\" per se is that it's not very useful because it only works for those who already kinda agree with it (and true physicalist should reject it). As for your definition of zombies, well, i also used to think that anybody who can't understand concept of \"consciousness\" (\"сознание\" to be more precise; in my understanding \"qualia\" are parts of it) in the way i used it, lacks it. But at some point i seemed to be able to explain it and given how hard it was, i can no longer be sure that someone who *doesn't* seem to understand it, necessarily *can't* understand it (and thus lacks consciousness). I think most people simply never bother with introspection and are too attached to materialism to understand it.\nAnd, to answer your question: no, i don't perceive myself as zombie; i do perceive consciousness and qualia.",

Thus, in a *trustless* community genuine emotions are widely seen as weakness. Another related thing is that emotions can be transmitted via empathy and thus fake emotions can also be used to attempt manipulation (that's one of the basics of arts).\n\nThis of course shouldn't be enough to actually *stigmatize* emotions for rational people, just be careful about them. But people tend to choose extremes. \"Stigma\" sounds like a strong word and if i read it correctly, only emotional people would actually go as far as to stigmatize emotions.",

But i may speculate the current emotion situation there isn't fundamentally different from the long standing debate on \"human nature\". Conservative thought (and i don't mean any specific parties or movements here) generally considers humans as dangerous. And the most dangerous thing in them is of course uncontrolled \"negative emotions\", because instrumental reason is supposed to be negotiable, even with an opponent.\nThe current usa anti-emotion \"lobby\" may have roots in freudism, reaction to nazism and then reaction to hippie and possibly other related 1960s movements (which, despite being \"based\" on \"positive emotions\" still looked like existential threat to governmental system).\nInterestingly enough, many \"progressivists\" share the same conservative approach and despite claiming to trust people to be good, do not act on it and like to suppress emotions in their own way (or even in the same way).\n\nI suppose it's the basis of virtually any large society: to frame emotions, limit their expression to ritualized or otherwise safe venting. I don't want to speculate whether it's actually necessary or not, just trying to analyze existing and historical situation. And of course, amount of repression might differ.\n\nAs for public online situations, since there's usually also little trust between peers, the same conservative approach is often being used. Showing emotions is considered to be sign of weakness (cult of strength is another large topic, i suppose) and empathizing to someone's emotions seen as danger to be manipulated either into acting irrational or just plain feeling bad.",
