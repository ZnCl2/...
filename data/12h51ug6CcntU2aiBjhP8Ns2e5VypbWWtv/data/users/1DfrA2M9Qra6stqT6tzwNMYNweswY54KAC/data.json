It is one of those 'perks' you get with pedophilia, if you're an exclusive. They grow up and at some point you stop loving them. This is really painful, as you are still in love with the younger version of that person. Imagine what it feels like to loose someone you are in love with. To have them taken from you, without you being able to do anything about it, the only memory remaining being pictures and images as you slowly come to terms with it and try to move on with your life. Kind of like the death of a loved one. And once you moved on, you'll probably fall in love again, knowing that this circle will repeat, knowing that you will loose your new love again and being unable to do anything to change that. \nSome fall into an obsession with videos/images, since the kids age in these images/videos doesn't change. Really, falling in love with an lolicon drawing or character in literature is one of the only blessings, that can save you from this madness, but that unfortunately isn't for everyone. Some people just can't fall in love with these fictional characters. They are forever trapped in that cycle, somewhere inside them knowing, that even if they manage a build a relation get warmth and comfort, it is bound to fall apart as soon as she leaves your age of attraction(aoa).",

Funnily enough, there are (apparently) classes, that teach help you improve getting off by using your imagination. From what I gathered therapy is basically identifying what exactly arouses you and then finding a substitute for it. \nThat said, I do not recommend seeing professional help, since in a lot of countries therapists are required by law to report you. Also in ~~any~~ many places the first step in therapy is to tell your social group, which depending on your social group can be detrimental. I have spoken with people, that had their live ruined after they've come out. I'd say the risks hugely outweigh the pros, but it really depends on your mental state and your stands on pro contact or anti contact.",

Maybe a family member of a friend(or the other way around) can have a word with their boss and get you a place to work and earn money. And even if not, they could get you a perspective on your situation.\n~\nDon't shy away from help, out of fear, that you would be a burden for those willing helping you. If you feel alone and helpless, go find people you can talk to and open up about this. Seek people who are in similar situations than you! I know this is easier said then done, but **isolation will _really_ hurt you**, especially if you're in a mentally difficult place!\n~\nWhether 'real' or online, getting these things off your chest and into the ears of others is the first step.

As deepfakes get more and more popular and widespread, you (some point) have to assume that any or at least some of the (for example) nudes you come across are indeed deepfakes, creating absolute plausible deniability for the victim.

To change the mind of someone stubborn isn't the point, the point is to stop his(or her) belief from spreading. While he has that believe and won't let that change his mind(or even consider changing it), everyone else he tries to convince can and most likely will point out that his images can't proof anything(if deepfakes become widespread and known to everyone).\n\n\n@Kaffie: \n\n>Just as any other nonconsensual sexual harassment/assault would be.\n\nThis is difficult, since where sexual harassment begins and ends is different depending on who you are and who you are. Personally, I don't care. For me things that don't affect me and things that just didn't happen might as well be the same. \n>There's not much \"good\" that seems to come from it\n\nFakes aren't a new thing and since it greatly reduces(or even nullifies) the affect those can have on my life, I struggle to even see much negative coming from it.\nBut I'm aware that not everyone shares my feelings on that, so take it however you want, I guess.\n\n>entire political speeches can be faked easily by anyone.\n\nBut this was and is also possible right now, without all the fancy AI stuff. This just eliminates the assumption, that such fakes are 'incredibly rare'. If these things become common place people will be forced to more thoroughly check the things they read, in order to be reasonable to everyone else, since as I said above everyone else also knows that images/video can be faked with ease. Therefore the argument must be made in a verifiable way to the person, that one would try to convince. And while one tries to make it as verifiable as possible, one might realize that their believes simply cannot be supported anymore.\n.\nThe majority of people are not on the far end of the spectrum of their believe, where they would be considered 'beyond the point of no return'(cannot be reasoned with). Something to keep in mind is: _Every believe starts and crumbles with doubt_. This **always** goes both ways.\nContrary to popular believe the vast majority of humans have only the best intentions and misinterpret reality while trying to help and do good.",

Not all are extremists when it comes to their believes and when you see yourself confronted with 'obviously fakes'(since they are against your believe), which all have as good or better quality as your 'proof', then that at some point that will make you think.\n\n>They will have little incentive to doubt their views,\n\nI disagree, people by nature want to share their views, they want to 'educate' and 'help' others to see as clearly as they themselves do. Having an believe and keeping it to yourself forever simply isn't going to happen. When was the last time you were convinced of something to be true and immediately thought: 'Well I'm not gonna tell a living thing about this'?\nAnd because you know, that everybody else knows that good fakes are easy, you need to prove your point as best as you can to convince anybody. Chances are, that while doing that you'll come to realize that you believe might not have been the absolute truth you _believed_ it to be.
