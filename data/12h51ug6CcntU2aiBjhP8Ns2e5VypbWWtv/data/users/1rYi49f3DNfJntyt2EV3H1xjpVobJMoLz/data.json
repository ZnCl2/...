Ironically, several years ago I truly believe that US is the hope of all mankind.\n\nEnough about myself. I don't want generalizing all Chinese people. But I believe at least people around me would agree with the YouTube comment.\nAll we want is peace and prosperity. No wars, no superpower bullying other countries. \n\n\"我们的目标是星辰大海\": Our goal is the stars and the sea",

Any educated people would understand why US do anti-China things. And more importantly, they also know how to wisely change it. Including trade war recently or real war happened in Korea and Vietnam decades ago. As long as we are developing independently, we have no interests pointing at other countries. That's basically how China gov deal with US gov or any other gov. \n- Westerners tend to say that Chinese people are brainwashed by CCP. But compare to more and more young generations in China know what CCP did. It's more likely normal American people been brainwashed by those media with bias reports.",
