It starts from zero and gradually introduces concepts like recursion, higher-order functions, curry, Church encoding, halting problem, lambda calculus,  fixed point, Y combinator, continuation, CPS, Godel Incompleteness Theorem, and a basic interperator for a simplified progarmming language. \n\nIf you think The Little Schemer is expensive, you can try [CoffeeScript Ristretto](https://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto), somehow a translation of The Little Schemer to CoffeeScript, which can be read on line for free. \n\nDo not worry the above books do not use a language you are going to use in your work. After all, the right approach to pick the certain programming language you are going to use is to focus on  semantics, instead of syntax; focus on concepts, instead of concrete details; focus on good parts, instead of all parts; also learning the implemantation of the language is a good way, since modeling is an effective way of learning (no need a full implement, also not worry about performance, just implement basic and import concepts).  The Littele Schemer fully conforms to this approach. Once you learned the scheme language with it, you know how to learn a new languge, and you know essential concepts of programing language. Then you can just pick up any language you are going to use in the same way. And because you only need to understand new semantics and concepts of the new language, it will be fast. For syntax, just use a good IDE or setup your editor properly.\n",

A has only one lan card to connect to B (make sure A does not have a wireless card, or has a physical switch to turn off wireless card).  B has 2 lan card, one for A, one for Internet. Running the browser on A and Tor on B,  and the connection between A and B is configured as NAT only. So A can only connect to Internet via Tor, and possible vulnerability in browser can only leak IP/MAC etc of A, not B. For max security, do not buy A online, incase the online seller may record A's hardware information together with your identity/address.\n\n2. the 2 virtual machine solution: similarly to the solution above, but use two Virtual machine instead. This does not protect you from virtual emualtor's escape vul­nerabilities though.

This makes up the wasted lines.\n\nI guess for large screens a few wasted lines is affordable for clarity.\n\nMaybe the Java style is suitable for a setup with small fonts on a small screen, provided the syntax highlight scheme distinguishes braces clearly?",

You do not know how to cook pasta, how to bake bread, and how to clean the window, etc. Fortunately there are a lot of volunteers to help you to do all these things.\n\nThe problem is these volunteers tend to commit suicide because of intrinsic depression. (They think helping a five year old may helps to reduce depression.)  And you are lazy and shy. You do not want to manage them yourself. There is a magician called Sysfive. When you go to sleep, Sysfive will kill those volunteers (not let them go home to avoid  traffic jam), and when you awake, Sysfive will reborn those volunteers. Also if you find some volunteer killed themselves, you can ask Sysfive to reborn them.\n\nThese volunteers speak a language named Gnome. You happen to speak this language, too. And all those volunteers are from the same nation Debian. Debian is located at a continent called Linux. The continent Linux is located at a planet called unix.\n\nYour friends have volunteers speaking different languages like KDE and Xfce, from different places like OpenSUSE (also on Linux continent) and FreeBSD (on the BSD continent), and different magicians like OpenRC and RunIt (one magician can work for a lot of children.) You talked with your friends, and found out that you can find volunteers speaking Gnome from any nation and continent. Also, although volunteers from some certain countries only have experience with some magicians, all magicians can reborn volunteers from any country with some effort. \"This is good. Maybe one day I will ask FreeBSD volunteers to help me. One of my friends said FreeBSD volunteers are cool.\" You thought. \"And maybe one day I can ask RunIt the master to reborn volunteers for me. I heard that Sysfive the master is too old.\"\n\nUntil one day, you learned that Systemd the master can only reborn volunteers from the Linux continent. Systemd refuses to reborn any volunteer from other continents such as BSD and Solaris.\n\nAlso you learned that soon volunteers speaking Gnome can only be reborn by Systemd. They refuse to be reborn by other magicians.\n\nAlso, there used to be different volunteers to do different things, for example, one helps you to do accounting (e.g. how much ham you have eaten, eating ham is bad for your health), and one configures your smart phone (smart phones are too smart to configure for a five year old). But\nSystemd said: \"I am very very powerful. I will do all these things. Send those volunteers away.\"\n\nYou as a five year old may not think Systemd is bad.\nBut I hope you understand why some people consider Systemd as \"bad\".\n",

Baidu tries to follow Google's strategy, shifting from a search oriented company to an AI oriented one. But apparently it is a failure.\n\nReasons why web is dying faster in China:\n\n1. As a developing country, mobile phones are the only devices to connect to Internet for a lot of people. And a lot of people first go online through mobile applications. And most likely these mobile applications are directly owned by Tencent or Ali, or by companies controlled by Tencent or Ali.\n2. Mobile payment is far more ubiquitous in China. (Unsurprisingly, the two most popular mobile payment methods are Ali's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay.)\n3. Both Tencent and Ali make their products very inconvenient to use on the web, lacking a lot of important features. They force user to use the mobile application instead. And there is no  regulation preventing them to do so.\n4. On the other side, regulation requires every user to bind a mobile phone number to use every web service.\n5. And obviously the authority dislike the open and free web. It is inconvenient and somehow dangerous to host an ordinary website. Want to host a forum? Even harder. Want to host a video site? No way!

What I want to say is that all of the three languages take one line of code to solve the problem, and with a decent editor/IDE, all three lines take equal time to type. Even assuming we all do programming with a basic text editor like Notepad on Windows or Leafpad in Linux, this example still has nothing to do with solving complex problems in less time. This problem is not complex at all. And most time of programming is not spent on typing.\n\nCurrently this video has 411k views, 8.1k upvotes (less than 200 downvotes) on YouTube.

My name is type your name\")\n```\n\nSo easy.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world! My name is weakish.\")\n```\n\nFailed! It turns out that the auto answer detection system thinks it is wired that my name is `weakish.`! Obviously the first quiz is to teach you just follow the instruction brainlessly. \"My name ...\" starts with a capital character, so it is a sentence. It is reasonable to end a sentence with a period (`.`), although this will fail the quiz.\n\nThe second quiz introduces comments, without telling the learner comment is used for what. \n\nAnd the third quiz introduces variable, but its first line is:\n\n```python\na = b = 2\n```\n\nWhat? Introducing chained assignment before normal variable assignment (`a = 2`)? \n\nChained assignment is not often used in practice. And I do not think it is necessary to introducing it to beginners.\n\nIn fact it is not only unnecessary, but confusing.\n\nA beginner may guess that `a = b = 2` is equivalent to:\n\n```python\na = 2\nb = 2\n```\n\nFor a value `2`, they are indeed equivalent, but:\n\n```python\nimport random\na = b = random.random()\n```\n\nis not equivalent to:\n\n```python\na = random.random()\nb = random.random()\n```\n\nAnd programmers from other languages such as C and JavaScript, may think `a = b = 2` is equivalent to `a = (b = 2)` where `b = 2` evaluates to `2`. But this is not true in Python.\n\nAnd the course mentioned nothing about these quirks.\n\nI guess the author may think `a = 2` is too boringly obvious to introduce, thus turns to introducing chain assignment directly. No! In fact, considering that in Python variables are reassignable, they are not boring for beginners at all.\n\nConsidering the following lines:\n\n```python\na = 2\na = 3\n```\n\nThis is not boring for a beginner. How can `a` be equal to both `2` and `3`? Seems mathematically impossible!\n\nThis is what the author really have to talk about, not chain assignment.\n\nI myself learned Python via reading the A Byte of Python book years ago. I am not sure if I should recommend it to beginners. Compared to [HtDP] for the exotic Scheme language and the outdated [Why's Guide to Ruby][why], it is somehow a boring book. And Python's official tutorial is well written. But at least it does not have such flaws.\n\n[HtDP]: https://htdp.org/\n[why]: https://poignant.guide/",

However the video does not explain why Android (nowadays the majority of linux users are Android users) does not use systemd if systemd is as elegant as the video claims.\n\nAnd the video also talks about docker and containers, without realizing that containers make systemd irrelevant. On the server side, services are packaged as containers, which are managed by docker, k8s, etc. Technically there is still an init daemon starting the service program inside the container and communicating with `docker`, but this is somehow implementation detail not interested by developers. And to reduce resource overhaul, a lot of containers use alpine linux as base image, and alpine linux does not use systemd at all.

But new languages are very serious about tooling and development productivity to attract more users. vscode has greater out of box support for TypeScript than WebStrom. And the Rust extension of vscode is developed by the IDE and editors team of the Rust language people (yes, they have a dedicated team for this).\n\nThere is a conflict of interest for JetBrains. For new languages, language sever is the way to go. It is very difficult for JetBrains to develop an alternative competitive code intelligence system, particularly when new languages like TypeScript and Rust are evolving very fast. So the only choice of JetBrains is to embrace the language sever. But language server is neutral to all editors and IDEs, thus it will not give JetBrains any advantage. And to earn money from those \"professional\" versions, JetBrains may deliberately remove features from free versions. For example, [debugger and profiler for Rust are only available in their nonfree CLion IDE][rust-clion].\n\n[rust-clion]: https://areweideyet.com/#intellij\n\nThe same thing happens to JetBrains' own language, Kotlin. Android Studio/IntelliJ have greatest support for Kotlin, and Eclipse have decent support for Kotlin. But JetBrains people are not willing to support other editors or develop a language server. There is a conflict of interest: to attract more developers to use Kotlin, they need to support more IDEs and editors, while to attract more developers to use their IDEs, they'd better only support their own IDEs.\n\nJetBrains IDEs still have the state of art IDEs for languages such as Java, Python, Go. But their language servers may catch up in future, puting JetBrains IDEs in an awkward situation.",

Translation or abstract translation.\n2. Taking notes and doodling with pens.\n\nWhen not having a pen at hand, Audrey will scan the book or pdf quickly (about 0.2s per page). Then she will rest for a while, maybe drinking some tea, and \"review\" those pages in mind with her eyes closed. If something occurred to her, she will note them down.\n\nWhen having a lot of materials to read, she will quickly scan them before sleep, and absorb them in sleep. She found out an 8 hour sleep can absorb around 400 pages of material.\n\nAudrey did most of her reading  on an iPad Pro (with a pen).\nShe uses the kindle app for iPad, but she converts all books she bought from different channels using calibre.\n\n## Emoji as a universal language\n\nAudrey thinks emoji is a more universal language than English.\n\nHowever, I think while it is cool to [making slides in pictures and emoji][emoji-slide]. It is difficult to express complex ideas only with emoji. For example, can you [guess what these slides mean][guess]?\n\n[emoji-slide]: https://speakerdeck.com/audreyt/reinventing-democracy\n[guess]: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Reinventing-Democracy-EbWGsC1m7MTUqaxNNAmdC\n\n## Humor over Rumor\n\nAudrey introduces the disinformation definition in Taiwan: intentional harmful untruth (harmful to the public). To counter disinformation, clarification need to take a humorous form, to become a meme spreading faster and wider than the disinformation. Also, humor helps to counter the irrational anger which motivates people to spread the disinformation.\n\n## iCloud\n\nUnfortunately, although Audrey is a [key sponsor][] of [sandstorm][] (self hosted platform for open source applications), and introduces sandstorm to Taiwan government, she herself still relies on iCloud to sync personal files.\n\n[sandstorm]: https://sandstorm.io/\n[key sponsor]: https://sandstorm.io/about",

But the release messages of [its beta version is very interesting](https://install.appcenter.ms/users/keepcoder/apps/telegram-swift/distribution_groups/public).\n\nFor example:\n\n> Thought to be lost for decades, Rembrandt’s first portrait “The Farmer and the Service Message Fix” was recently discovered in the attic of a Belgian café.\n>\n> A spoonful of sugar makes the service message fix go down. \n>\n> What's cooler, fixes or a cucumber? \n>\n> I’ve got 99 problems but the fixes ain’t one. \n>\n> The secret ingredient to a good update is a tablespoon of fixes.\n>\n> No devs were harmed in the making of the widget/themes in this update.\n>\n> Mom, where did you put my fixes? \n>\n> Fixes are in the eye of the beholder.\n>\n> Fixes are now machine-washable.\n>\n> Roll a D20 to resist the fixes check.",

Monitor ZeroMail continuously, a lot of information can be analysed, since messages are usually replied within a few minutes/hours/days, and deletion of messages probably marks end of conversation. Analysis can be speed up with other activities on ZeroNet (ZeroMe, ZeroTalk, etc). For example, someone are more likely to send a zmail to someone they follow on ZeroMe, or have some conversation on a post on some forum. Another example is someone only posting in Chinese on ZeroMe are less likely to send a zmail to someone only posting Russia on ZeroMe.

But what the hell is `(((zipWith (+)) list_1) list_2)` means? My blunt brain needs a few minutes to figure out it means to zip two lists, we need a box that has one input channel for a function, and produces a second box with an input channel for a list, and the second box produces a third box with an input channel for another list. These Russian dolls tend to fill up my brain quickly. Traditional argument lists are quite straightforward to me, and not cumbersome at all, compared to currying. Currying does be less cumbersome when functions are sent to higher-order functions for transformation, though.",

I prefer to hibernate because next time I turn on the machine, I can continue to work from where I left. Thus at least on Linux and Windows, hibernation with full disk encryption is as secure as shutdown. But the hibernation term is a bit vague for Mac OS X. On Linux and Windows, hibernation means ram content is on disk and power is off (thus ram content is wiped). But on Mac OS X, hibernation means ram is on disk, and ram content may be wiped or not. After saving ram content to disk, Mac OS X laptops may not wipe the ram content (ram is still power on) under some conditions. Thus hibernation on Mac OS X laptops may be less secure.
