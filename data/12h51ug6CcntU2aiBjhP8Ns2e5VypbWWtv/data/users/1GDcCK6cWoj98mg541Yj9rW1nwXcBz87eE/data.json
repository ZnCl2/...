Let me know how far you're able to push it before it gets slow.\n\nI added comment numbers to the gallery list just like the favs, added a crude button to view comments below the infobox and finally fixed the famed comment duplication bug (erroneous SQL query from the 0-gallery days).\n\nShowing latest comments somewhere is a good idea. Could I ask you to make such requests on the Git Center page in the future, it's hard to keep track of things if they're on ZeroTalk, ZeroMe, ZeroMail, etc.",
