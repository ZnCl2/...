Our everyday experiences, distilled into data, have become a privately owned business asset used to predict and mold our behavior, whether we’re shopping or socializing, working or voting.\n...\n> Combining rich information on individuals’ behavioral triggers with the ability to deliver precisely tailored and timed messages turns out to be a recipe for behavior modification on an unprecedented scale.\n...\n> Many people, it seems clear, experience surveillance capitalism less as a prison, where their agency is restricted in a noxious way, than as an all-inclusive resort, where their agency is restricted in a pleasing way.\n...\n> the book challenges assumptions, raises uncomfortable questions about the present and future, and stakes out ground for a necessary and overdue debate. Shoshana Zuboff has aimed an unsparing light onto the shadowy new landscape of our lives. The picture is not pretty.",

Just before I got there, the monkey stopped and a mobile phone started ringing. And then I saw where all the noise was coming from: a parrot just inside the door, with a small \"I'm not for sale\" sign on its cage, who went back to doing the feline meowing when I arrived. :D\n.\nI guess a parrot that lives in a vet's clinic gets to learn the calls of all kinds of animals (and phones). :)",

After posting *uncaptioned* photos of Hong Kong Tiananmen 6/4 anniversary candlelight vigil on his WeChat [Moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat#Moments) private feed (meaning WeChat is probably running some kind of automatic image analysis that flags if they are sensitive), his account was suspended on suspicion of \"spreading malicious rumours\".\n\nHe had to agree that he was guilty of spreading rumours and submit to a ***face and voice scan*** (which you know is going straight into a govt database of \"rumour spreaders\") to apply to get back in. And he really had to do it because living in China without WeChat is becoming an impossibility.\n\n> When you meet somebody in a work context they don't given you a name card [sic] any more, they share their WeChat; if you play for a football team training details are on WeChat; children's school arrangements, WeChat; Tinder-style dates, WeChat; movie tickets, WeChat; news stream, WeChat; restaurant locations, WeChat; paying for absolutely everything from a bowl of noodles to clothes to a dining room table… WeChat.\n\n---\n\nI used to have an account with Tencent (the company behind WeChat) but kept getting locked out, even though my content there was absolutely not political. They gave no info at all as to why they wouldn't let me into my account (in the end I think the \"sync with Tencent\" option I had activated on a third-party site was probably the trigger). Tencent would only give instructions for \"have you lost your password?\" which was not the case for me. The help options in English were a disgrace. Any other info was in Chinese (and lots of words there were actually images, making it hard to run through a translator). In the end, the only way I could get back in was to have someone in China do the process for me from a Chinese phone number.\n.\nThe third time it happened, I just gave up on all things Tencent.

I haven't found any for DDE on other OSes yet.)\n\nRe the privacy of the OS, people check on that, monitoring its connections. The only issue seems to have been that a few years ago, the Deepin OS software store (and only the software store) was connecting to an analytics company to gather statistics like number of users etc. [Many distros are trying different methods to work out how many users they have](https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20190121#news), and connecting to an analytics firm is something a few other distros do too IIRC. Deepin being a Chinese distro, they used a Chinese analytics company rather than a Western one that Western people would be familiar with, so Westerners became very concerned with this \"mysterious Chinese connection\". Deepin explained what it was, and even so, eventually removed it.\n\nAgain, that's deepin ***OS***, not DDE. DDE on something like Manjaro isn't going to use the deepin OS software store.",

In 1664 he was challenged by Yang Guangxian and the Muslim astronomers, who accused him of planning a rebellion and of having wilfully miscalculated time and place of a funeral and in that way contributed to the death of Consort Donggo. Schall von Bell and other Jesuits, Ferdinand Verbiest included, were imprisoned. Schall von Bell had a stroke in prison. At trial, Verbiest spoke in his defense, but all were condemned to death. However, after an earthquake, the Jesuits were pardoned and only five Chinese Christians working in the astronomical office were executed. The Jesuits were exiled to Macau. Schall von Bell died within one year of his release.\nSo, no slow slicing, apparently.",

Parts in curly brackets {{example}} I'm not sure about the exact meaning, maybe you could provide the original *en français*.\n---\nSome of you mentioned that because there are no central servers, ZeroNet sites do not track users or collect data. I believe this is an important point that we can take further. Relying on selling users' data for profit also has a big impact on design and user experience. {{The UX: one specific UX? Or many in general?}} is being developed in such a way as to generate user data and doesn't contribute to creating a quality UX. I would even argue that it has created toxicity {{(even increasing hate ?...)}}. Metrics used to build the UX never consider the quality of {{the exchanges}}.\n\nAnother point might be the need for privacy. Tor is already a good solution for this on its own. A recent post I saw struck me. It was a father mentioning that his daughter has a drug problem (of course it was posted anonymously). Researching information about it on Google would make {{them: who? Google?}} aware of this and it is frightening that big companies have that kind of information about minors. My belief is that privacy is needed to raise fully grown and functional human beings.\n\n\"Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.\" Sometimes you need this and I think Zeronet also serves this purpose.",

Even though we are in the broadband era, many webpages take as long to load as in the dial-up era.\nAlthough (I believe) there is technically nothing stopping 0net zites from becoming so bloated, the decentralized nature and the user's control whether to allow a size greater than 10MB (for an entire **site**, not just for a single page) mean webpages on 0net zites are much cleaner and lighter.\nI just loaded a 0net blog homepage and it was total 247kb, and I think 60kb of that was the logo.

Twitter, Facebook, and all major web service providers immediately changed their rules to tightly police what was posted and messaged about sexual content, by anyone. Entire online communities were kicked off services like Cloudflare (55,000 users of Switter), and hundreds of thousands were disappeared by the shuttering of safety forums and advertising-screening services. Reddit removed entire communities overnight. Recently, YouTube banned videos where people simply talk to sex workers.\n\n---\n\n> When Tumblr erased millions of sex blogs and communities overnight, many lamented that without the website they would've been lost and suicidal trying to figure out their sexuality. When I worked the sex crisis call lines in 2005, before Tumblr, our most common call was from teens in abstinence-only education states who did not know how to prevent sexual disease, infections, injuries or pregnancy — and youth who were terrified they weren't \"normal.\"\n\n---\n\n> In 1997, Ann Powers wrote an essay called \"In Defense of Nasty Art.\" It took progressives to task for not defending rap music because it was \"obscene\" and sexually graphic. Powers puts it mildly when she states, \"Their apprehension makes the fight to preserve freedom of expression seem hollow.\" This is an old problem. So it's no surprise that the same websites forbidding, banning, and blocking \"sexually suggestive\" art content also claim to care about free speech.\n\n---\n\n> Facebook recently banned sexual slang; YouTube bans users for sex ed or LGBTQ content because it might be about sex; Twitter has a mysterious sex-shadowban that no one can get a straight answer on. Tumblr can't tell a potato from a boob. Guides on sexual self-censoring are popular — and necessary. Google Drive scans your files and deletes what it believes to be explicit content. Apple just straight-up hates sex.\n\n---\n\n> **It's critical at this harrowing juncture to understand that apps won, and the open internet lost. In 2013, most users accessing the internet went to mobile and stayed that way. People don't actually browse the internet anymore, and we are in a free-speech nightmare.**",

Here's a little info based on what I remember from the last time I used Ares a few years ago.\n\n---\nAres Galaxy is an \"old-fashioned\" P2P program (like eMule, Shareaza etc) in these ways:\n+ you open the program and search for files inside it. (Unlike BitTorrent, where you go to websites and private sites to find .torrent files or Magnet links.)\n+ you share folders (and all the files in those folders) on your computer, and you can move and rename those files without problems. (Unlike Bittorrent, where you only share files you have a torrent/magnet and choose to seed, and moving or renaming files can cause problems).\n+ It is more persistent: files can last on the network for years, whereas with BitTorrent, often there are no seeds after just a few weeks.\n\n---\nIn terms of content:\n+ the total is less than all the content available from all torrent sites.\n+ a lot of users are Spanish-speakers, so a lot of the available content is in Spanish.\n\n---\nFor example, I wanted to get an old documentary that was bilingual (Spanish and English) that had not been released on modern media (DVD, legal streaming etc).\nI could not find it anywhere on Bittorrent, ed2k, YouTube, cyberlockers, etc. Eventually I tried Ares and, using the inbuilt search, immediately found someone sharing a copy from VHS from the 1980s and successfully downloaded it!\n\n---\nBut apart from special situations like that, I didn't find it that useful because it didn't have a lot of the English-language content (TV shows and films) that I want to get from P2P and there are not many sources/seeds, so I use BitTorrent all the time.",

If I understand correctly, that's not really right: when you \"upload\", that just copies the file to a subfolder in the ZeroNet folder on your hard drive. The file only uploads once another ZeroNet user else gets the file. So, now, a lot of people might see \"Upload complete\" and, as they would on a clearnet server site like Youtube, think \"Mission accomplished!\" and maybe even go offline right after.\nSo maybe a better word would be \"**Share**\" instead of \"Upload\". Perhaps that way people would realize all they've achieved is giving access to the file to other users, and they need to stay online for other users to actually get the file. Maybe even add a small reminder message when they share something, like:\n> ***Congratulations on sharing!***\n> *Now other people can receive the file from you if you are online and connected to ZeroNet.*",

Even the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/news/supporting-webm), [Xiph](https://www.webmproject.org/about/supporters/#foundations) (creators of Vorbis and Theora) and Mozilla are supporters.\n+ I *do* remember Google killed Reader. Because I used to use it to get my RSS feeds. Feeds which I was able to read today right before coming here, because Google can shut down a *service* (e.g. Reader) but cannot shut down an open *standard* (e.g. RSS).\n+ IMHO Google's AMP (and Facebook's Instant Articles) (and mobile app versions of websites in general) are genuine threats to the open web and need to die.\n+ HEVC (h.265) seems [far more problematic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding#Containers) in terms of restrictions and licensing.\n\nServices and products can be killed. But open software, standards and formats, once released, can live on forever even if their original source changes their mind.\n\nSo even though I don't trust Google, for *me*, the fact that they were the original proponents of WebM and WebP is not enough for me to rule those open formats out.",

			"body": "My main issue with copyrights & patents is not that they exist at all, but that certain lobbies have taken a short-term limitation (25 years in the beginning) that was originally created by government for the public benefit (to encourage promulgation of knowledge, back when that was uncertain and expensive) and turned it into a near-eternal (e.g. author's life + 75 years!) private benefit for rent seekers* (in an era when we've never had *less* need for expensive publishers/gatekeepers/middlemen getting their cut), and have sold governments on the idea that copyrights & patents are all about \"justice\" for \"creators\", with the principal of public benefit completely hijacked (only what's good for the IP lobbies is good for the public, apparently).\n\n---\n*I say rent seekers, because often IP doesn't really benefit the actual creators but instead companies who didn't create anything, like patent trolls, or companies whose business model is centred around screwing over an unending conveyor belt of young & naive hopefuls. E.g. record companies with plentiful lawyers and years of institutional experience who get teenage musicians who don't know any better to sign multi-year contracts handing over their copyrights and/or royalties until their \"investment\" in the artist has been paid off.\n\nE.g. De La Soul's 1989 album \"3 Feet High and Rising\" isn't on Spotify because the band is pissed off that their old record company wants to garnish the band's (already miniscule) royalties from it, claiming De La Soul still owe them money on it... 3 ***decades*** after it was released and sold millions of copies, earning the record company a fortune in the process. (IIRC *The Empire Strikes Back* still hasn't technically made a profit, according to 20th Century Fox's accountants. So no profit sharing for the actors.)\n\n---\nIMHO trademarks are not as big a problem, as they don't seem to restrict the public from using / enjoying *knowledge* (books, music, medicines, inventions etc); as far as I can tell, they mainly just stop shitty businesses capitalizing on the marketing imagery (logos, slogans, etc) of other businesses. But maybe there's a case against them too.",
