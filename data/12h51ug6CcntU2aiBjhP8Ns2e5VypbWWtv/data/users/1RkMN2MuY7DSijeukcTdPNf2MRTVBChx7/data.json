			"body": "Don't be panic. The reason that Chinese users is active in zeronet is because the CCP of Chinese Gov. has implemented an insane censorship on Chinese people in social networks domestically and  overseas. What's more, the CCP has built powerful state-level firewall (called GFW) to check each bit of data transmitting through the international internet ports to the liberal world.  Zeronet is an alternative cyberspace to express relatively freely.\nIf you don't understand the Chinese characters, you can translate them with Google Translator, and will find the truth of what the Chinese users talking or discussing on Zeronet.\nThe common Chinese people have too much burden on their backs and shoulders so that they don't have time to plot things as you said above.\n",
