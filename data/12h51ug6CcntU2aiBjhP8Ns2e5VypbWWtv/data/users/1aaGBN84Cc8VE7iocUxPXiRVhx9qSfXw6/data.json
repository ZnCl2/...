The other neighbor just looked at me like I was a superhero and said \"Goddamn, thanks dude!\" and walked off dumbfounded. So that was cool.",

It feels like I'm focusing a singular point of my sense of self into someone else and pull their thoughts in like a mix between being the radio and tuning into a frequency and like a tidal force pulling water. Like being the beach and the lens focusing one or two thing for an eye exam. Or leaving my body it's like these strings getting cut and I just will myself out like turning off clipping in a video game. This is weirder though. It's like I can feel it tactile-like but it's like a tension in my brain and I don't really know how to describe it other than as touching something without touching it if that makes sense. It doesn't feel the same as just moving something with my physical limbs.",
