I didn't even get a captcha.\nHere is what I was trying to write:\n\n\nBitcoin is the future!\nPrivacy is only one feature, and it's often misunderstood. Bitcoin is only private if you are very careful about that aspect. \n\nBut it has so many advantages over any existing means of payment:\n* asset based\n* cheap transaction fees\n* no holding fees\n* you can create as many accounts as you like to compartmentalize your holdings\n* no requirement to bind an account to one person\n* accounts can be shared between individuals or machines\n* the car could have a bitcoin wallet and directly pay for electricity, parking, roads... maintenance\n* can't be stolen as long as you hold it yourself and take care of your private keys\n* no devaluation through (centrally planned) inflation\n* In case of a dispute you can proof an unfalsifiable payment on the public immutable blochchain\n* has escrow built into the protocol\n* no chargebacks\n* settles in seconds for low values and one hour for extremely high values.  \n\nYes it is more volatile than legacy currencies, but it gets better over time and generally trending upwards.\nThere are payment companies that handle the volatility and conversion to USD for you for a fee that is one fourth of credit card fees.\n\nSo, yes Tesla should look into Bitcoin.

Now I'm in the process of setting it all up again.....  \nI had to flash a new bios because with the old one it wouldn't even boot form the new ssd.\nbitcoin full node, mysql, postgres, wordpress, namecoin, zeronet, ipfs, twister, dhcp server, mailserver, dyndns, dyname, caldav and carddav server, electrum server .....  the next few evenings are booked.",

I want to pay for what I use, not a fixed rate per month, and then be locked into an ongoing contract that is hard to get out again.\nSo I launched another attempt at paying for content. \nSpecifically, I didn't even know how I would go about watching Game of Thrones legally. I really wanted to do the right thing for season 7. A friend told me to go to the HBO website. So I did, and actually found the [episodes for season 7](https://hbo.co.uk/game-of-thrones/season-7)\nThe episodes list 7 different options to buy. \n* apple itunes: I have no apple device and no itunes. My browser reports: itmss is not a registered protocol.\n* Amazon: The website asks me to activate DRM in the browser. No thanks! I don't buy stuff that has DRM! And I don't activate any binary blob in the browser!\n* talktalktvstore: The website displays a banner, that you can browser the stuff, but I can't watch it.\n* google play: I didn't use a google account in years. No idea what I would get if I reactivated my account. How I could pay, and where I could watch it. Specifically, I don't have an Android device.\n* rakuten: We are deeply sorry but Rakuten tv is not available in your country.\n* playstation store: I don't have a playstation, and the browser displays: Access Denied\n* Xbox store: plays only on Windows, this implies DRM\n\nNothing working! What does that leave me with?\n\nOn the other hand, I love [reelhouse](https://www.reelhouse.org/) where I can pay for the DRM-free movies with Bitcoin. Just the selection is very limited.\n",

The bluetooth keyboard didn't work. My first thought was that I would have to re-pair under the new desktop environment. So I plugged in a crappy old keyboard to log in. After pairing the BT keyboard again, it worked .... for a few minutes. After some playing around I figured that it keeps working only if I use it constantly. As soon as I pause for more than two or three minutes, it's gone.

			"body": "I just used Adobe Acrobat Reader again after probably more than ten years. My memories of it were not really good. But it was workable back then, if you were ok with using bloated, closed source software.\nI had to fill out a pdf form for the company today. It was a four page document that mostly repeated the first page. It doesn't seem to make sense to fill out the same stuff four times in a row. So I asked if it's ok to do it just once, and then they could print that page multiple times. The diagonal background image that says \"copy\" didn't look so important to me.\nBut then my boss told me, I should use Adobe Acrobat Reader on a Windows machine. Because then a script would copy the entered text to the other pages.\nOk, I don't install software like this directly on a production machine. So I put it on a virtual machine. When I opened the file, an advertisement jumped on top, covering most of the document. After clicking that away, I realized that every time I entered an entry field, if would be cleared. So I had to type everything again. With Evince, I could just select and copy the text that was in the fields.\nBut the best part came when I was through three quarters of the document, typing everything again. All of a sudden, all entry fields of the whole document were wiped clear. And there was no way of undoing it.\nHolly shit, how can people work with this piece of crap?\nI ended up switching back to Evince, and copy-pasted everything to the remaining pages. It is unnecessary work. But at least it works reliably.",

We use our system to analyze mobile apps' compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), one of the few stringent privacy laws in the U.S. Based on our automated analysis of 5,855 of the most popular free children's apps, we found that a majority are potentially in violation of COPPA, mainly due to their use of third-party SDKs. While many of these SDKs offer configuration options to respect COPPA by disabling tracking and behavioral advertising, our data suggest that a majority of apps either do not make use of these options or incorrectly propagate them across mediation SDKs. Worse, we observed that 19% of children's apps collect identifiers or other personally identifiable information (PII) via SDKs whose terms of service outright prohibit their use in child-directed apps. Finally, we show that efforts by Google to limit tracking through the use of a resettable advertising ID have had little success: of the 3,454 apps that share the resettable ID with advertisers, 66% transmit other, non-resettable, persistent identifiers as well, negating any intended privacy-preserving properties of the advertising ID.",

The setup is a bit involved with hardware key based full disk encryption.\nWhen I messed up something last month, I restored that backup. The notebook booted the first time, but didn't really behave correctly. After that it didn't even boot any more. So I freshly installed the notebook. All the important data was save from regular backups. But after a week I discovered, that there are some things that I would like to grab from the old disk. But from the external HDD I can't even see the partitions. I guess the best way would be to buy an SSD of the same model as in the notebook, and restore the backup onto it. But that seems like a waste of money. What is so different between HDDs and SSDs that this backup is not usable on the HDD?",

At first, they bombarded the servers with very resource intensive electrum requests. But at some point they added a general DDOS also on other protocols and ports. As a result, internet at home has been very slow and unreliable for the last two weeks. It sometimes reminds me of the times when I connected the mobile phone with the notebook through IRDA. \nThe only things that still work well under these circumstances are the services with asynchronous protocols, such as ZeroNet, IMAP and RSS. Websites are often not usable.\nMy wive is also complaining. I think about stopping my electrum server to have my home internet work again.

The red lines diverged from the white lines to shift a full lane to the right. All cars except one followed the red lines. I can't explain how, but I had a feeling that the car right of me with Italian license plates would just go straight following the white lines. So I decelerated to have him in front of me.

It could quite possibly be a good solution for trucks. But it is not proven yet, there is virtually no infrastructure. Most importantly, Nokola so far only showed pictures of what they want to build. Maybe they have prototypes, but I didn't see them yet. \nI get that Tesla is valued higher than other companies that produce way more cars. But Tesla has probably a million cars on the road and has proven technology and execution.\nIf I remember correctly. Tesla had a couple hundred thousand cars on the road when it had the valuation Nokola currently has.\nEven if people believe in hydrogen, it is crazy that a company that hasn't produced any products yet is valued higher than many reasonably sized car companies.\nI never shorted a stock, but if I was into this game, this would be the one I would pick. Yesterday I heard in a podcast that it is not easy to short this one, as the fees are as insanely high.\nhttps://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-semi-vs-nikola-ev-truck-costs-discussed-by-ark-invest",

Last night I put up a small tent on the patio and slept inside at temperatures slightly below freezing. It would have been cool to do it together with one of the kids. But my wive freaked out and called it child abuse. She was worried they would freeze to death in a sleeping bag designed for minus 10 degrees celsius.\nI know that sleeping bags lose their isolation capability if they get wet. This is why I used a vapor barrier liner on the inside and an ultra light biouvac bag on the outside. To my surprise, in the morning the inside of the biouvac bag was totally wet and so was the outside of the sleeping bag. I was comfortably warm the whole night, in fact I had too warm sometimes. But I am still curious where this moisture came from, and how I could prevent that.",

This time it reported the luks partition as being smaller. But this time it allowed me to restore. Later I resized the luks partition with gparted to consume the rest of the physical disk. Now I was able to unlock the luks partition with cryptsetup. It contains an lvm physical volume with a volume group (vg) and some logical volumes. It lists all of them with lvs, but prints a warning about a device being smaller than expected. I see most of them in /dev/vg/ and I can mount them. Only the most important one doesn't show up in /dev/vg/. I checked the manpage of vgscan for some force option, but found nothing. I am not really familiar with lvs, and am close to giving up.",
