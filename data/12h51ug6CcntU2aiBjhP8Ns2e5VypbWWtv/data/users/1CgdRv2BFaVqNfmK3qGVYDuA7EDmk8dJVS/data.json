			"body": "It's not in a usable state yet. I plan to continue work on it, but I got demotivated after my normie test subject were unable to figure out how to use ZeroID and select a certificate. They didn't even have to install ZeroNet, I spinned up a proxy for them and a step-by-step manual with screenshots was included. I discussed this with some other ZeroNet developers on Matrix and we concluded that it would be best to develop a proxy plugin for normie-friendly user login, but I haven't done so yet.\n\nThanks for your interest, I'll see what I can get done this weekend! The one positive thing about taking a break is that I've figured out some improvements to the data design while working on 1+Gallery.\n\nWhat do you mean by safety? Privacy-wise products are public, orders are private between the customer and vendor. The model assumes that the customer trusts the vendor, but the vendor does not have to trust the customer. Once the vendor \"accepts\" an order it is moved from the customers data file to the vendor's file so the customer cannot alter them anymore, but they can still access their order history.\n\n- The first goal is that the vendor can process payments through PM, i.e. \"Send me X BTC to this address.\", \"I did\", \"OK, I can confirm, here's your download link/your package has been sent/you can come claim your order at Y place\"\n- Once everything necessary for that is implemented I'll try to add an option to link your Paypal for processing orders.\n- After that I'll look into public ledger cryptocurrencies like BTC, it should be easy to verify a payment for those by sending a request to a site.\n\nNon-public ledger cryptocurrencies are off the table for me. I don't know how they work and I don't have the time to learn how they work. Merge requests will of course be welcome, and coming to an agreement e.g. \"Send me X Monero.\", \"Ok, done!\", \"Thanks and here ya go!\" will always be possible for those who wish to use such cryptos.",
