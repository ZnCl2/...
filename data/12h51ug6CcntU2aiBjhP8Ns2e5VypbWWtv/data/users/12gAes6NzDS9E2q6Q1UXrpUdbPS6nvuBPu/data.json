Punctuation includes: . , ! ? ( ) [ ] { }\n* You can now add images while editing a story\n\n### Bug Fixes\n* Empty responses and stories are *kinda* disallowed (There is still a bug that I'm unsure how to fix)\n* The \"publish\" button is temporarily disabled after clicking it when publishing a response. This prevents people from accidentally clicking it twice, which will post the response twice.\n* Images that are uploaded will have the date uploaded appended to the filename. This ensures that there are no collisions with image names.\n* For images that are uploaded with non-ascii characters in the filename, the non-ascii characters are removed - this is to prevent a ZeroNet bug with non-latin characters. Spaces are also replaced by underscores and quotes (double and single) are removed.\n* The registration will not continue until you select a primary language and enter a username.\n* When posting edited story, if title is same as before, no need to add date to end of it\n* When interests is empty and you click to follow an interest, do not start the interests string with a comma ','.

What *will* change is when versions are released to ZeroMedium BETA. Upon the final release of a new version to the official zite, the next version after will also be released to ZeroMedium BETA. *This will give beta versions at least 2 weeks for bug fixes* before being released to the official zite. This also means that I will be working two versions ahead of the official zite.\n\nSo what does this mean now? It means that later today (it just turned 12:00am as I am writing this) I will release the next version (17.12b) to ZeroMedium BETA.

Once that happens, the client updates, looks through the \"users\" table for the current user, finds which \"cert_.json\" file to look at, and get's the certificate from that file and verifies the id was created.\n\nNow, I know that KaffieId doesn't rely on a server, and uses the certAdd cmd, but does it have a database that stores all of the user's ids? I'm guessing not because that would have to rely on an id provider, right? So how do clients verify ids that come from KaffieId?",

If a particular word from the search query has no matches, it will lower the result by one [they are basically like ordering points, I guess], unless it's in strict mode, then a result that doesn't match all words from the query will not be shown. If none of the words from the query match the result, it won't be shown (in *and* out of strict mode). You can see the algorithm [here](https://github.com/krixano/ZeroExchange/blob/master/src/router_pages/topic_search.vue#L62).\n\nHowever, the main problem with this algorithm is that it needs *all* of the possible results (all questions in this case) to be stored in a variable and used in order for it to be accurate. Therefore, you can't do a database limit, offset, and pagination. So, I am going to eventually experiment with implementing something in SQL so that we can do the pagination stuff and still have a good searching algorithm.",

You can find the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2A8D1dwwEY&feature=youtu.be) or on [KopyKate](http://127.0.0.1:43110/big.kopykate.bit/?Video=1523721954_12gAes6NzDS9E2q6Q1UXrpUdbPS6nvuBPu). Here's the [Github Page](https://github.com/krixano/Edim).\n\nThe program is written in C and is over 2,000 lines of code now. Hasn't been tested on Linux or Mac - so those platforms may have some bugs (particularly with the input system).",

This certainly goes against the Network Effect, right?\n\nWhile users has an effect on the value of a zite, it's not the **only** value. The value of the features of a zite can go beyond the value of it's users - which is hopefully when new zites gain more users. Of course, this only matters if we had proper discoverability, and people actually *try* to discover new things.\n\nAnyways, thanks for using KxoVid.\n\n### For Non-KxoVid Users\n\nWhy should you use KxoVid? Here's Why:\n* Merger Zites - less centralization - no one owner who controls what videos are shown/allowed\n* KxoId Support - KxoId is the first id provider that offers unique usernames while ensuring requests are handled inside the ZeroNet network, including if you are using Tor. It will also be federated in the future (I'm getting close to being done with this). Also supports ZeroId for people who don't want to get a KxoId (for some reason)\n* *Optional* Chromecast Support\n* Playlists\n* Better design, especially for mobile\n* Doesn't allow resources added by users (thumbnails, for example) to require loading from the clearnet - better on privacy and security\n* Multiple channels per user id\n* Much Better searching and Related Videos",

			"body": "The point of open-source software is not to freely give away your work in return for nothing. The point is that programmers can learn from and reuse code from other project to continue growing and expanding the technology and methods used in new products (or the same product). It's not unlike how the arts work....\n\nIn the arts there's this thing called copyright, which used to last for the lifetime of the artist plus some years. Why? So nobody can steal their work as their own until enough time has passed for the credit to be clearly distinguished - and then it's \"open-sourced\" in the end so that people can eventually reuse and learn from it. This is how it **should** work, imo.\n\nJust like anything, open source software comes at a price - the price that another person or company can come along and steal your code and give you no credit. *This is fine in a world where you can sue these people for not obeying the license's terms* (in the case you have something in your license that requires giving credit) - but small companies and single person's likely don't have the time or money to sue or get lawyers.\n\nAnd this is *especially* problematic in ZeroNet, where everything is decentralized and anonymized. You can't sue someone when you can't even figure out who they are, where they live, their ip address, etc.\n\nI think people miss the point of open-source software. They're equating open vs. closed as good vs. evil - which is ridiculous imo. Keeping something closed forever makes no sense, imo - and I will agree to that. But there *is* a point to making something closed for a period of time - it's called Copyright (the original idea of copyright). A person should get credit for what they do - and that's the stance I take.\n\nBtw, I'd like to point out that the majority of people vehement about closed-source software I don't think are thinking logically or realistically about the actual benefits closed-source software may provide in specific circumstances, and they are oblivious to the real problems open-source software actually has (and yes, it **does** have problems).

It seems you think I'm supposed to know the \"entirety of the situation\" by reading your mind rather than looking at the sentences you write.\n8.) You think being burned by one person is cause for not trying to help another homeless person again.\n9.)

Will they still be able to use the existing data, *and* would they be able to store new data in this new format, etc.? And further yet, will this new data be able to be used in the other version of the zite that don't have these new features? I don't know much about Merger Zites, so yeah...",

I get it, you want the old extensions back, but security should come before that I think, and as far as I know, WebExtensions are more secure *because of* their limitations. An added benefit is that extension devs can use more of the same code between Chrome and Firefox versions. Also, WebExtensions will make plugins not break everytime Mozilla wants to add new features to their browser. Overall, I think this change had to come sooner or later (multiprocess Firefox would have broken many extensions anyways). Obviously it'll be tough to migrate all the extensions, or wait for features to allow some of the ones that wouldn't currently be supported to be migrated, but you just need to be patient.",

To sign manually, you have to go to your merger zite, but append `/1` to the url so it doesn't redirect to GitCenter. Then, open the sidebar and do it from there.",

It could be, idk. However, once ZeroNet received the updated files for ZeroId, as per the code I posted below, It looks up the auth address in the files. The reason why it does this is because it uses the auth address from the \"Unique User\" selection rather than by having you log in to your zeroid (and no it doesn't automatically log into it after registration either). Therefore, there is no certificate stored that it can decrypt to check for your zeroid. Instead, is takes the auth_address from the Unique User selection (which is default) and checks the list of users to see if it exists. If it does, it shows the information. This is also used when you visit the zite in the future, since your certificate isn't stored (since you're not logged in, remember).\n\nNot only have I provided you with the code that supports exactly what I am saying, I have given you proof that such a list of users exists (via [this link](/Me.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv/12gAes6NzDS9E2q6Q1UXrpUdbPS6nvuBPu/1512383277)). And btw, that file you linked to only returns \"OK\" ([here](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroID/blob/master/publisher-http/solution.php#L116)). And Furthermore, this code supports that fact that that file you linked to only returns \"OK\" and nothing else:\n```\n$.post \"https://zeroid.qc.to/ZeroID/solution.php\", {\"auth_address\": @auth_address, \"user_name\": $(\".username\").val(), \"work_id\": task.work_id, \"work_solution\": solution }, (res) =>\n\t\t\tif res == \"OK\"\n\t\t\t\t@setRequestPercent(80) # Solution ok, site change published, waiting for update\n\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t@cmd \"wrapperNotification\", [\"error\", \"Solve error: #{res}\"]\n\t\t\t\t@endRequest()\n```\nAnd, hey look, it even says `waiting for update` in the comment.",

			"body": "@Git Center: When a user registers for a provider, they are given a signature. This signature is just the user's information (username, portal type, and auth_address) put into a string and encrypted with a private key. This signature gets copies over to not only your `data/users.json` file, but also any `content.json` file you have on any other zite. When ZeroNet verifies that a user belongs to a particular id provider, all it has to do is decrypt this signature (from your `content.json` file inside your user folder on the zite) using the id provider's public key and check that the information from that decrypted string is the same as what is in the user's content.json file (because the content.json also lists the username, portal type, and auth address is given from directory). The only question is how does ZeroNet know the public key of an Id Provider? This is actually very simple. It can get it from what the Zite Owner put in the \"cert_signers\" part of their `data/users/content.json` file (the part where you put something like `\"kaffie.bit\": [ \"1KH5BdNnqxh2KRWMMT8wUXzUgz4vVQ4S8p\" ]`). This public key for KaffieId was given on the homepage.\n\n> Also, do you know when are ZeroID users verified? E.g. can I change my data/users/.../content.json's cert_user_id to nofish@zeroid.bit and signature to use nofish?\nYou can now see where the problem with decentralized Id Providers lies. You cannot do this with ZeroId because you need ZeroId's private key to be able to create the signature. However, you *can* do this with KaffieId (e.g. changing your username to glightstar@kaffieid.bit) because it's private key is public. This would pretty much be the same as using that change username feature on the KaffieId zite, except that it will store the changed username in your `data/users.json` file for you (but you could do it manually yourself).\n-\nBasically, the way ZeroNet verifies users is very similar to how it verifies zites, by using these signatures that were encrypted by private keys. It decrypts them and checks if they match what they should (hash of content.json for zites, user info for users).",

Editing is already implemented actually - I just don't show a link to go to the edit page yet - but you can manually do it by typing in `[address]/?/edit-zite/[id of zite from your data.json file]`.\n* All of the voting stuff you mentioned is planned - I'm just not sure about implementation yet.\n* Design is a very subjective and a personal thing - so instead of changing it completely to fit a specific person's preference, it would be better that I just created different designs and allow for you to choose one via a settings page. However, almost no search engines that I know list a zite on *only* one line. It's at least 2, 1 for the description and one for the title. Unless you'd want to get rid of descriptions that is.\n* I don't have any dedicated servers at home and I don't have money to go paying for one, so the peer count won't be doable for me in the near future (unless someone wants to dedicate one to me). Furthermore, I'm not completely sure how the peer count is implemented (but I have a vague idea of it).\n* I will provide sorting options. Right now, the zite list isn't sorted alphabetically. I'm not precisely sure what it's sorted by because I'm only sorting it by # of matches to search input. If all of the zites have the same matches (like when you have a blank search input), then it's going by the order of the zite listing in the sql - which is based on the order of the zites in each person's data.json.",

All it does is make sure you are using the https version of the websites/links, which means https has to be supported by the website in the first place. I believe it also uses a whitelist, so it only works for the sites on the whitelist. The description it gives on chrome addons page isn't completely clear that it only works for https-supported sites (and on a whitelist).\n\nFrom their website:\n> HTTPS Everywhere protects you only when you are using encrypted portions of supported web sites.\n> ...\n> For example, if your web mail provider does not support HTTPS at all, HTTPS Everywhere can't make your access to your web mail secure. Similarly, if a site allows HTTPS for text but not images, someone might be able to see which images your browser loads and guess what you're accessing. \n\nand\n\n> HTTPS Everywhere can protect you **only when you're using sites that support HTTPS** and for which HTTPS Everywhere **include a ruleset.**\n\nThis is why I consider the addon a little useless, imo (because to me, it seems that https websites are always going to give their links in https and many of them automatically redirect from http to https, especially the one's popular enough to warrant being on HTTPS Everywhere's whitelist).",

Regarding the url possibly being leaked with https redirection, https doesn't protect against getting the domain you are going to anyways:\n> HTTPS Everywhere **does not conceal the identities of the sites you access**, the amount of time you spend using them, or the amount of information you upload or download from a particular site. For example, if you access http://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying and HTTPS Everywhere rewrites it to https://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying, **an eavesdropper can still trivially recognize that you are accessing www.eff.org** (but might not know which issue you are reading about). In general, the entire hostname part of the URL remains exposed to the eavesdropper because this must be sent repeatedly in unencrypted form while setting up the connection. **Another way of saying this is that HTTPS was never designed to conceal the identity of the sites that you visit.**\n\nFrom what this sentence says `because this must be sent repeatedly in unencrypted form while setting up the connection.`, I wonder if HSTS helps with this since *I think* HSTS prevents from having to repeatedly send information to set up the connection.

Video pages worked because I had did a check for null subscriptions on those pages, but I guess I forgot to do it for the other pages.",
