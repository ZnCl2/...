Tried following this http://127.0.0.1:43110/1N6zp6jCXPBktNMPfe7UJBpQGyfCq7k2M8/?Post:25:How+to+change+your+ZeroMe+Hub but it appears the file structure isn't the same under Mac (or, since that article's from 2016, it's out of date). Then I read someone on here said that people on other hubs will show up now on ZeroMe after adding the hubs via the first site. Not sure if that's all I needed to do. I haven't seen any indication that I'm seeing other hubs other than me seeding them. And of course, like a million other people said, if you click on them they say to browse to it via ZeroMe. Which is why it's confusing. ",
