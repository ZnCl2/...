Maybe another reason to use vanity generator when creating new site. Actually if i want to replace example kopykate.bit in all my ZeroTalk comments/posts by true address, i quit Zeronet, backup the .db file, use search & replace app, and then on ZeroTalk go to (0) menu, \"this i my zite\", sign and publish main content.json ?",

Using the figures above, we can then reasonably estimate that 43.2% of global Bitcoin mining is powered by renewables in Sichuan.\"\nQuestion is how the data about renewable electricity from china are correct. I can not believe coal electricity is significantly or more expensive at all than one from renewables (because of the investments involved) versus already running coal power plants. Though if that is true about Sichuan, the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_power_stations_in_Sichuan shows it is hydro-power and this power source may not be as eco friendly as estimated: https://www.scidev.net/global/energy/news/dams-raise-global-warming-gas.html",

Suspending a laptop's state (“sleeping”) is also ineffective, even if the machine enters screen-lock on awakening, since an adversary could simply awaken the laptop, power-cycle it, and then extract its memory state. Suspending-to-disk (“hibernating”) may also be ineffective unless an externally-held secret is required to resume normal operations.\n\n**With most disk encryption systems, users can protect themselves by powering off the machine completely when it is not in use.**\" so @ulrichard:, you were apparently correct. If one is afraid government or skilled thief will come and take/steal ones computer, one should be rather shutting down the computer when going away from it :-/ i have not researched if there are any new ways to hibernate/sleep without risk the decryption key will be obtained by the hacker.",

My Zeronet is using 4.5GB of memory (private bytes) and like 6GB of virtual memory. But i think @nofish has no time to replicate this or does not know how it can be fixed. Equally big problem for me is that zeronet is extremelly slow sometimes (for example loading image on Millchan or publishing content on Zerome takes not couple of second, but sometimes 30 seconds or many minutes). I maximized multithreading in [/Config](/Config) and verified the disk iops is low)\nOnly workarounds i think about is: A) distribute the hosted sites across multiple devices like Raspberry Pi's, VPSes... it will allow utilizing more CPU cores, more RAM. B) sell current computer and buy one with more RAM (using virtual machines to run multiple ZN instances may allow utilize more CPU threads - https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/2312",
