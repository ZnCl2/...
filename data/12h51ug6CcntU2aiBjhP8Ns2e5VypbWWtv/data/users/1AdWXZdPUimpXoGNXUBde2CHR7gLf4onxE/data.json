If you are on the right side of the spectrum politically you have had your face kicked in more than one time on the web and probably are banned on Facebook and Twitter.\nWhen you are forced to sing the tune of (George soros) funded Adolf Hitler the cows will wish they fought back before it was to late. \n\nMassive Social media advertising is what zeronet needs now. The SJW's don't give a dam about censorship. As long as there hateful offensive racist Nazi rants are allowed to continue they will love every minute of killing off any opposition who hasn't been forced to have a sex change or isn't gay.  Hitler was a latent homosexual Jew. He hated himself and projected it out in the world. Just like the Liberals are doing today. \n\nIt if looks like a duck, talks like a duck, quacks like a duck. \nIts a DAM DUCK!! ",

Everyone has a bad day from time to time or may post content that you absolutely object to. However later on they may post content that is very useful and good. Ultimately I would love to see a timer on a ban list that could be user set. Say (username) posted spam or stupid stuff that I did not like. (Like they got drunk and posted!) I can put them on a time out block. It could be set it up as an hourly block to a month and year block. I think we have all been jerks at one time or another and a timed out block list might be a useful tool.  When time out is finished a notification should be coded that (user) block has reached there time limit. ",

Good side effects of p2p. Lower bandwidth usage. And redundancy file storage making data even more secure because of its redundancy of storage. It is a design win win on so many levels. Eventually those 3 tb drives we buy will be used for Zeronet web storage. Also for the first time you can carry websites with you that work without internet. Will P2P someday replace the server farms? That sounds totally crazy doesn't it. They said the same thing when the automobile was invented.

The way to keep the ratings the same is to use the exact same material at the same size. You can find out how to make capacitors on youtube and other sites. \nYou may save money on the higher rating caps if you make your own. You will need a regulator circuit to adjust the voltage at the right level. If you make a mistake you could easily fry the device. I would put a fuse in the circuit to ensure that you cant fry it out. Its best to always over design an electronic circuit. It will last longer that way. ",
