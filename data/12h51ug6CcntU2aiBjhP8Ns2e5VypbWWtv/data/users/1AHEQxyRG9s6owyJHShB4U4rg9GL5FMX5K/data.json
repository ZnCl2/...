Also in any places the first step in therapy is to tell your social group, which depending on your social group can be detrimental. I have spoken with people, that had their live ruined after they've come out. I'd say the risks hugely outweigh the pros, but it really depends on your mental state and your stands on pro contact or anti contact.\n\n\npretty much why social care is fucked everywhere and that if i have a \"mental disease\" i rather rot alone with myself then to surrender my life to them\nit's like a game theory scenario, you know it's \"wrong\" and you want to \"fix\" it wyd?:\nyou tell them, you roll the dices on getting caught and fucked your life up\nyou rot alone, you get to rot alone and muster up whatever you can gather to cope with it\n\nsometimes people want to do the \"right thing\" but fear for their own wellbeing so they fall back to just try their best to cope with it\nhonestly the healthcare system shouldnt work like this...",
