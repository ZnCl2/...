That's quite a nice feature but it has some disadvantages:\nThe link text is quite long and can eat up the limited storage if a user has too many activities. The link text is in front of the post, and on ZeroHello newsfeed the actual post is hidden by it.\n\nInstead I think users can use `search user` feature to search others. Or Sakana may auto-generate the link for text that has the pattern `@user`. Like what sakana has done for `|><||>`",
