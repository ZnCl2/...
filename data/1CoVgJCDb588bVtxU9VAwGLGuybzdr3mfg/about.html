<p>For my fellow text-only browser users (or the visually impaired), the top banner says "Red Liberty; Socialism or Barbarism, Liberty or Death! (Formerly known as Thought Foundry Blog)".</p>
					<p><strong>Early Beginnings<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Red Liberty (formerly known as Thought Foundry Blog) was started with WordPress in 2016 as a way for me to post my thoughts and ideas onto the internet. It started off as a largely personal blog. Initially I posted about Astronomy, Egyptology, Technology, Science, and occasionally Economics. But of course, today we write about politics and other fun stuff like hacking.</p>
<p><strong>Political Leanings</strong></p>
<p>Between the creation of this blog and now I had become a Marxist after much reading and thought and the blog took a largely political turn. However, being ruthlessly critical of everything I quickly became disillusioned with the so-called socialist states of the 20th century and grew increasingly sympathetic to Trotskyism and  later Luxemburgism (and other forms of Libertarian Marxism). Over time I began to see the historical limitations of these movements and while still looking upon them favorably, came to investigate other schools of thought such as anarchism and contemporary enlightenment political philosophy.</p><p>My views became over time radically anti-authoritarian and libertarian, perhaps a reaction to the blatant totalitarianism of some tendencies on the left. Much to my surprise I found that many of the same conclusions I was coming to were already formed by a social theorist of the 20th century named Murray Bookchin whose arguments I more or less accept. Bookchin's <i>Communaism</i>, or <i>Social Ecology</i> I'd say match the current political leanings of this blog more than anything else. I also have great respect for the American revolution and the system of government its constitution established, a view often not shared on the political left. I will from time to time write on constitutional issues in tangent with issues pertaining to civil liberties.</p><p> I&#8217;ve also come to apply hacker ethics and ideals to my political philosophy, regarding a revolutionization of digital life on libertarian grounds to be as essential as anything in the physical world. Hence I am a strong advocate of privacy in the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>Some Popularity</strong></p>
<p>I created a Facebook page and apparently people liked my posts. Some of my videos and posts got several million views. Currently it has over 11K likes and is one of the more prominent blogs on the left (there aren&#8217;t a lot of us).</p>
<p><strong>Why is everything on one page?</strong></p>
<p>For the time being this version of the site has been used uniformly across every mirror I maintain. The design decision to do everything myself without a static site generator stems from the nature of Freenet. On Freenet site pages that aren't accessed frequently enough tend to fall out of the network, thus it actually makes more sense to put everything on one page. In time I may switch to a Wordpress install for I2P and Tor, and use a static site generator for the ZeroNet site, but really it all depends.
<p><strong>To The Reader</strong></p>
<p>I hope the reader will enjoy reading, and will understand that older posts <em>often</em> no longer reflect my current views which are always changing. I am always open to the possibility that everything I &#8220;know&#8221; is wrong, for no one has a monopoly on the truth. We can only try our best after evaluating the objective facts to the best of our ability. Enjoy.</p>
