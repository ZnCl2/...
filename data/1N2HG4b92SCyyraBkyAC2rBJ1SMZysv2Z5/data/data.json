It creates a P2P swarm that allows the exchange of IPFS objects. The totality of IPFS objects forms a cryptographically authenticated data structure known as a Merkle DAG and this data structure can be used to model many other data structures. We will in this post introduce IPFS objects and the Merkle DAG and give examples of structures that can be modelled using IPFS.\n\n•https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbEt4yJaHZDeHsbKZ1pwH54RCkpyGRBRUzhSeQv2iWQ3K\n\n•http://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXtXwN6VZKjFqmEMXvrjEJxk6hvHJbynuVuzJyYT7Qk8f"
