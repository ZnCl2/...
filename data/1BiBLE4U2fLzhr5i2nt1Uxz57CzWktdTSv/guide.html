understand better some truths from the Bible. When I found this in our family archive, I was amazed
by his work and realized, that would be perfect to bring it here to help people who may ask questions
about what the Bible teaches about God, his Scripture, about Jesus Christ, about baptism and etc.

  <li>or you are trying to do what is right, what is just, but you just realized that
  it will never be enough, or it will never give you enough confidence.</li>

If so, then you are on the best way to understand, that <u><b>there is a way for you, and the only way through Jesus Christ,</b></u>
as the Romans 10:9 says: <i>&bdquo;that if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in yours heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.&rdquo;</i>,
God is waiting to hear your prayer. If you don't know how to pray, you can pray a prayer similar to the following:

                </p>

                <p class="guide-quote__text">
                    &bdquo;Dear Jesus,<br><br>
thank you, that you gave your life also for me. I realized, that I lived far away from You.
Please, forgive me my sins and please give me a strength to forgive others.
I do no longer want to live my old sinful life, but I want to start a new way in Your presence, with You.
Please, be Lord of my heart and my Shepperd and lead me through your way.<br><br>

                    If you did that, this is an amazing message! And I am are really happy with you.
There are a few things I really recommend you to start with:
<ul>
  <li>Find some local church, where people really love Jesus.</li>
  <li>Read the Bible. If you don't know how to start, I encourage you to start with the Gospel of John.
  It provides basic overview of who Jesus is and about His mission. Few other books I recommend to read
  after the Gospel of John are Romans, Proverbs, Psalms or the book of Genesis. You can also use our guide.</li>
  <li>Pray to God. You can freely pray to God Father, through the name of Jesus Christ. You can also start to read
  some verses about <a href="guide.html#prayer">the prayer</a>.</li>
  <li>(optional) Feel free to <a href="about.html#contact">contact us</a>. I would like to hear and rejoice with you about your decision.</li>

You shall not make to you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.
Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Six days shall you labor, and do all your work:
But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger that is within your gates:
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: why the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.
You shall not kill.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's. <span class="nowrap">- <a href="bible.html?lang_ref=en&bible_ref=AKJV&book_ref=Exod&chapter_ref=20&highlight=verse3%2Cverse4%2Cverse5%2Cverse6%2Cverse7%2Cverse8%2Cverse9%2Cverse10%2Cverse11%2Cverse12%2Cverse13%2Cverse14%2Cverse15%2Cverse16%2Cverse17&anchor=verse3">Exodus 20:3-17 (AKJV)</a></span>

                    According to the covenants and laws between God and the chosen people of God from the people of Israel,
the people of Israel were responsible for committing the sacrifices of the sins before the high priests,

                    &bdquo;For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: why it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.
But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, said the Lord.
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old.

For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:

Be not you therefore like to them: for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask him.
After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
