"river" / "река" is one of my many ultra-short stories, now the first to be made
into what i like to call "video-book": a story narrated and accompanied by
appropriate imagery.

it took me a while to make this one, but in the process i've learned a lot, both
software-specific things and some general understanding about video-making. i
hope (and expect) the next one will go much faster.

the story narrated is in russian, and there are russian subtitles as well as
fairly literal english translation available.
