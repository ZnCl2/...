in this episode i'm creating a new track from scratch. a theme, variation, and a
little bit of instrumentation with some sparse comments

the program i use is ardour

sorry for all the background noises; i'll try a better audio setup next time

if you're interested in continuation of this series, make sure to say so before
it's too late. also feel free to post requests on what kind of work would you
like to see covered
