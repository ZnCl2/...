</div>

my first attempt at (almost) live coding with commentary where i utterly fail at
making progress because i was away from the project for a long time

code repository: https://notabug.org/caryoscelus/rainynite-linaer

fullscreen recommended if you want to try following the code

feedback is appreciated. i'm not sure this is good enough format to continue,
but i'll make at least another episode
