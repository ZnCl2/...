00:23.081 --> 00:23.743
River

00:25.211 --> 00:27.594
Approaching river, human stops in fear.

00:28.206 --> 00:31.687
Not surprising: strong flow, so attractive from afar,

00:31.778 --> 00:33.864
from close distance can appear terrifying.

00:34.532 --> 00:37.926
Especially for one who has a hunch that he will have to enter the river.

00:40.309 --> 00:44.204
Many years later he will not be able to recall those moments of fear and arousal.

00:44.382 --> 00:47.290
Will not be able to see the world with the same view as he sees it now.

00:47.834 --> 00:50.705
Will not be able to imagine what does it mean to enter the river.

00:52.242 --> 00:54.486
But now human stands on grassy shore,

00:54.563 --> 00:57.960
doubtfully watching stormy stream, flowing from nowhither to nowhere.

00:58.745 --> 01:02.868
In the river, here and there, flicker fish fins, float by logs and branches,

01:02.960 --> 01:06.255
lean out and dive again someones' wet heads.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.445
Subconsciously human understands that he is one of them,

01:10.933 --> 01:13.297
alike wet head in the expanses of universe,

01:13.374 --> 01:16.073
but cannot fully accept and feel it.

01:16.653 --> 01:19.408
From the shore they look so tiny and fleeting.

01:20.136 --> 01:22.259
From here human is more ready to believe in kinship

01:22.280 --> 01:24.793
with multi-century oaks or young birches:

01:25.412 --> 01:29.265
they are like him, leisurely standing in full height,

01:29.433 --> 01:32.672
not dashing with unthinkable speed of the stream, creatures.

01:33.607 --> 01:35.375
And still he makes another step.

01:36.048 --> 01:39.380
Cold river breeze blows round him, sways his hair,

01:39.401 --> 01:41.450
cools his flushed mind.

01:41.657 --> 01:45.622
Initial fear goes away, but arousal and wariness doesn't leave him.

01:46.890 --> 01:49.143
Human slowly makes next step.

01:49.611 --> 01:50.413
And another one.

01:50.917 --> 01:51.961
And another.

01:53.135 --> 01:55.240
With every step the river enchants him still more.

01:55.652 --> 01:58.789
It becomes still harder to tear gaze away from the stream and look down at his feet.

02:00.304 --> 02:04.329
After a few steps human stumbles and clumsily falls on wet soil —

02:04.610 --> 02:07.532
only at the last moment does rosehip bush catches him by the hand

02:07.815 --> 02:10.440
and human hardly manages to keep balance.

02:11.057 --> 02:13.887
For these few moments grip of the river weakens.

02:14.261 --> 02:17.388
But having learned its icy temptation, how can he resist?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.203
Empty hopes.

02:19.797 --> 02:22.626
Yet again human raises his eyes onto raging waters

02:22.834 --> 02:25.664
and yet again falls into their sweet, exciting captivity.

02:26.484 --> 02:27.714
He does not resist.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.364
His fear — the only thing that could have stopped him —

02:31.685 --> 02:35.278
withered to the size of sand grain and no longer rules the human.

02:36.712 --> 02:38.855
Yet again he lifts leg and makes a step.

02:39.472 --> 02:40.627
And another one.

02:40.833 --> 02:41.672
And another.

02:42.327 --> 02:44.338
And now the river swashes about at his feet,

02:44.339 --> 02:47.580
water splashes are falling on his face, awakening ancient instinct.

02:48.661 --> 02:51.882
And still, arriving at the edge, he stops again.

02:53.057 --> 02:54.417
It's not about fear at all.

02:54.606 --> 02:57.529
Simply, before entering this new, unexplored path,

02:57.792 --> 02:59.617
he has to part with the past.

03:00.192 --> 03:02.729
The very idea of parting is for him as new

03:02.764 --> 03:05.055
as the river, which he has to enter.

03:05.299 --> 03:09.524
And thus he lingers, vainly trying to make sense of this unavoidable change,

03:09.527 --> 03:11.947
to remember at least something from previous life,

03:11.950 --> 03:14.389
before the past will shatter into myriads of shards.

03:15.899 --> 03:17.631
To him, the fear of forgetting is still unknown,

03:17.857 --> 03:21.245
he feels only light anxiety, not understanding its reason.

03:22.011 --> 03:24.971
And if he would understand, what would he be able to do?

03:25.866 --> 03:28.826
He will have time to regret about this unavoidable choice,

03:29.239 --> 03:32.627
but now he opens eyes and makes yet another step.

03:33.355 --> 03:36.353
Cold water burns his foot, but human does not stop,

03:36.336 --> 03:37.920
and on the contrary speeds up steps

03:38.224 --> 03:41.282
and now after a few seconds he is in the water up to knee.

03:41.977 --> 03:43.003
And then up to waist.

03:43.322 --> 03:44.384
And then up to chest.

03:45.634 --> 03:49.058
And then the stream catches him up and he rushes down the flow,

03:49.063 --> 03:53.642
away from familiar soil, away from weeping willows and ferns,

03:54.020 --> 03:57.008
away from the past that slips into darkness.
