title: about caryo's moving pictures
---

"original, weird, moving" ; these pictures, projected at 24-25 or more frames
per second, accompanied by specially crafted sounds, are known to cause changes
in human brain ; safety of such changes is neither confirmed nor particularly
expected

techincal means of delivering are known to be riddled with subtle (and less so)
shortcomings ; author has only assured their own ability to experience this
place as intended, using zeronet and firefox ; in particular, subtitle support
(which may prove essential) is very flaky, as well as commenting

on the brighter side, these pictures are almost completely rid of the so-called
"copyright" burden ; for convenience they are "licensed" under cc-by-sa, but
what really matters is the spirit of free, open culture

to elaborate on the motto, "original" shall not mean they are necessarily made
from scratch (which begs the question) ; indeed, some of them borrow directly
from other open culture and public domain works ; rather, "original" indicates
that the pictures were made for this particular space
