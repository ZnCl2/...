Currently this blog system is quite damn crude. I plan to spruce it up with a
new post interface, comments and such blog stuff.

Technical todo:

-	Setup Backbone.js routing properly using it in tandem with the ZeroFrame API
- 	A "create new post" interface, which asks for my private key in order to
	allow posting new blog posts
-	Commenting of some kind
-	Post search when the volume of posts is larger
