            "body": "I've found an error: limiting GETINFO to 'version' for all paths stops onioncircuits working correctly. This is better than the alternative of allowing any program to access all tor information. The best solution would be to specify the zeronet exe-path, but also possible is to skip the unnecessary GETINFO altogether because people shouldn't be running old tor versions anyway! Than we don't have to whitelist GETINFO at all. Commenting out the lines\n```\n  res_version = self.send(\"GETINFO version\", conn)\n  version = re.search('version=([0-9\\.]+)', res_version).group(1)\n  assert float(version.replace(\".\", \"0\", 2)) >= 207.5, \"Tor version >=0.2.7.5 required, found: %s\" % version\n```\nin src/Tor/TorManager.py and dropping the `GETINFO: 'version'` from zeronet.yml worked for me.",
