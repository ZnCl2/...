But use jpg for the ending. Then go back to your Zeronet and resave and reinitialize the picture. Then it will play for you.\n\nZeronet is a good example of how to create a decentralized, censorship resistant social media platform.\n\nAll of the censorship elements can easily be removed. But you will probably need to fork it. And reprogram it deterministically. Which is the way the Bitcoin protocol is programmed and maintained.\n\nMy programming days are passed. So some of you young bucks will have to do it..ðŸ¦ŒðŸ™‚\n\n</pre>",
