# ZeroMusic

The purpose of this Zite is to make a platform where everyone can upload mp3 files. Using optional files, it only download the songs you want to listen to.  
This is currenly highly experimental, and many features will be added soon:  
- [x] Sorting songs by artist
- [ ] Option to edit songs metadata (artist, title, album, track number etc...)
- [ ] Custom interface
- [ ] Automatic detection of metadata based on [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3)
- [ ] Search engine
