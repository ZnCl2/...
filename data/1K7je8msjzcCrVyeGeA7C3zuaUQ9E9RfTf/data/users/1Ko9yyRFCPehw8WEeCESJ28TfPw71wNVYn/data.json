				"body": "Thanks for the additional information related to Arch. \nIt was not straightforward in my case since I was using Vidalia to start Tor so the cookie is located in ~/.tor/control_auth_cookie which requires an additional line in Vidalia torrc (~/.vidalia/torrc):\n   CookieAuthFile /home/alpha/.tor/control_auth_cookie\n\nThen I switched over to the regular Tor service with the settings from the docs and your additional steps but would still get a Permission Denied related to the cookie file.\nI found out that the chmod g+x /var/lib/tor/ gets automatically reverted by Tor upon start (Fixing permission step).\n\nThe only way so far to get it working is to start Tor via systemctl then manually change the permission of /var/lib/tor before starting Zeronet. This still doesn't work with the Vidalia front-end.",
