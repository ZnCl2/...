			"body": "Reed Collection\nThe Purgatory Creek Soundware Reed Collection includes no less than four reed-based electro-mechanical pianos spanning a decade of manufacture. Each captures the authentic sound of original instruments with great detail.\nThe collection includes all of the instruments shown below:\nReed RP 200a\nReed EP 140b\nPianet N\nPianet T\n\nThe layout of the Kontakt instruments is similar. You will find a three-band equalizer, volume for the release samples and a velocity curve dialog box which allows the user to adjust the instrument to respond to touch. In addition, each has controls for the tremolo, phaser and reverb effects. Finally, a number of amp simulations are provided.\n\nIn all, you have four deeply sampled reed-based electro-mechanical pianos in a single collection at a very reasonable price.\n\nReed EP 200a\nProduction of the 200 series reed-based electric piano began in 1968 and continued through the 1970s. It was the most popular of the reed-based pianos and can be found on many recordings throughout that period and beyond. The 200a series offered improved electronics and noise reduction over the original 200.\n\nThe Purgatory Creek Soundware Reed EPs 200 a was deeply sampled at eight velocity levels recorded for the full duration, so you will hear neither loops nor artificial envelope decays. Each note was sampled and eight velocity layers of release samples also are included. The instrument uses 32MB of RAM and requires 256MB of free disk space.\n\nReed EP 140B\nThe 140b electric piano, produced in the early to mid-1960s, uses steel reeds to generate its tone. Though the later 200 and 200a models were more common, the 140 series electric pianos can be heard on numerous recordings made in the 1960s.\n\nThe Purgatory Creek Soundware Reed EP 140b provides ten sustain velocity layers and an additional seven release sample layers. Each note of the 64 note piano was recorded for full duration, providing an accurate sound with no artificial decay envelopes or sample loops. The instrument uses 44MB of RAM and requires 465MB of free disk space.\n\nPianet N\nThe electro-mechanical piano, upon which this sample-set is based, was manufactured between 1965 and 1967. It is a rare reed-based instrument.\n\nThe Purgatory Creek Soundware Pianet N was deeply sampled at eight velocity levels recorded for the full duration, so you will hear neither loops nor artificial envelope decays. Nearly every note of the instrument was recorded and note-off release samples are included. The original instrument included a mono tremolo effect which is emulated. The instrument uses 28MB of RAM and requires 307MB of free disk space.\n\nPianet T\nManufactured between 1977 and 1982, the Pianet T was popular as a light-weight alternative to larger, heavier electro-mechanical pianos. While its sound is not as tonally expressive as other instruments, it does possess a unique, intimate sound.\n\nThe Purgatory Creek Soundware Pianet T was deeply sampled at eight velocity levels recorded for the full duration, so you will hear neither loops nor artificial envelope decays. Nearly every note of the instrument was recorded and note-off release samples are included. The instrument uses 28MB of RAM and requires 210MB of free disk space.\n\nRequires FULL version of Kontakt  Will only run in demo mode in the Player.",

			"body": "Say hello to a world of plinks! Plink 2 builds on the success of the original Plink Kontakt instrument by adding a far better user interface, some additional sample sets and a dedicated FX section with bespoke convolution reverbs, delay and a multimode filter to sculpt the perfect plink.\n\nPlink 2 provides a beautiful collection of plinky sounds. To create this instrument I sampled a wide variety of sources, including old and new synths, vintage guitars, a ukulele, a banjolele, a music box, toy instruments, a beaten-up piano plus sounds like kitchen glasses and a bicycle wheel.\nAs well as a re-designed GUI, created by Paul Lebachner of Sound Aesthetics Sampling, the sample sets have been tweaked, start points adjusted and some of the more wayward samples tuned to produce a more polished sounding instrument.\n\nWith the new GUI, polished samples and funky FX, new life has been breathed into the original plinky sample set. This makes Plink 2 a better sounding, and far more versatile and fun instrument to play and explore.\n\nPlease note that the full version of Kontakt 5.8.0 or higher is required\nThis instrument will only run in demo mode in the free Kontakt Player.",

			"body": "NEW! The NEW version of ETHERA, our much-loved Cinematic Vocal Instrument, includes a GIGABYTE of entirely new vocal samples performed by Clara Sorace, and numerous new features and improvements.\n\nETHERA is a stunning cinematic vocal instrument that combines amazing vocal samples, incredible simplicity and a high degree of playability all packed into a beautiful Kontakt interface for total ease-of use and ultimate sound manipulation.\n\nEthera 2.0 now features FOUR main instruments: Phrases, Pads, Legato and Phrase Builder.\n\nPHRASES:\n\nThe Phrases section now includes 58 patches ranging in styles from Epic, Fantasy, Celtic, Operatic, Tribal and World and even EDM and soul. These can be mixed and combined and using the two Off-Set controls you can change the starting points of the samples using the waveform display. This allows you to create new phrases and to personalise the existing phrases. These phrases can be manipulated in many ways by the GUI controls including time-stretching or syncing to your host application.\n\n\nPADS:\n\nThe Pads section contains several beautiful vocal pads that immediately add emotion or grandeur to your compositions.\n\nLEGATO:\n\nThe Legato section offers the ability to ‘play’ the voice of Ethera using ‘ohs’ and ‘ahs’ in sustained or staccato modes and features Attack, Legato Speed, Release, Vibrato, Pan and Volume controls.\n\nPHRASE BUILDER:\n\nThe Phrase Builder is a set of samples and phrases programmed to act as an intelligent entity allowing the composer to live-play any articulation, on any pitch or chord. The Phrase Builder is available in Solo Legato & Poly! There are 20 individual steps (similar to a step sequencer) with which to program your unique phrase.\n\nThe Phrase Builder also includes a new Legato Expert interface that uses the powerful SIPS engine and is the main control for the Legato Phrases Builder. With this Tab you can change and control the cross-fade, blending and legato modulation. It will enable you to minutely adjust the legato to suit your playing style.\n\nFurthermore there is an additional folder called ETHERA EXTRA with awesome extra sounds such as virtual legato patches, sustains & pads.\n\nETHERA 2.0 also comes fully equipped with a complete FX section that includes chorus, flanger and phaser, compressor, EQ, filter, convolution reverb, overdrive, delay, amp simulator and cabinet simulator.\n\nEthera is dubbed ‘cinematic’ but it also works really well for Soul, EDM, Tribal and World music too. Check out the video demos to see for yourself.\n\nWHAT’S NEW in ETHERA 2.0\nThe new features and improvements in Ethera 2.0 (as compared to Ethera 1.1) are as follows:\n\nA Gigabyte of NEW samples performed by Clara Sorace\nNew Cinematic Phrases\nNew Cinematic Phrases Special Sfx Reverse Mode\nNew Cinematic Phrases Builder Legato (23 Phrases & Phonemes )\nNew Cinematic Phrases Builder Poly (23 Phrases & Phonemes )\nNew Cinematic Phrases Builder Key Switch\nNew Cinematic Pad Patches\nHD Patches With “HQ Time Mode”\nExpert Legato TabExtra Sound Issues Fixed And New Presets",
