There is a button (kind of like button) which visitors can click to donate some money / show appreciation. I think on zeronet can be such service where people create account, deposit some money via cryptocurrency/ies and then can pay to the zeronet content creators a contribution this way. Zeronet content creators would need to place that \"donate button\" on their zite.",
