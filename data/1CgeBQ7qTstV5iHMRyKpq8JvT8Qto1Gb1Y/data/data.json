			"body": "# This is the ZeroBlog for the DNP #\n![image alt](img/Cattura.PNG)\n## **FAQ(ing)** ##\n\n**what's the DNP?**\nThe Darknet Project is a protest, is a right, is a concept related to free speech and international freedom. We are providing free hidden services to fight anti-censorship, we support people unable to speak up freely, censored information, and we are against any form of oppression, tyranny, masses control, filtered and altered information: here you will find your voice, here you will be free to tell your truth.\n\n**Why we do that?**\nWe strongly believe in freedom of speech and international freedom all around the world and the net\n\n**Are we Anonymous or some related to the Anonymous Hacktivists/Activists?**\nNo! we're an indipendent project. Also if we probably support (trough our free hidden services) many anonymous #Ops we're not in any way linked, connected or taking part to any Anonymous Collective/Operation\n\n**Are Services really totally free?**\nAbsolutly yes. We don't ask nothing, all services are 100% free. The only we ask you is to never forget that with your goodwill and your idea you'll be able to change the world\n\n**Are we linked or connected to Politics or Companies contests?**\nNO! We are a couple of free guys from the free world that use own money time and passion to set-up this project. This project is self-sponsored and we haven't any partners or donors"
