Here is an example of a Wi-Fi project - a repeater on the ESP8266: [...]\n\nThanks for the link. I had already accomplished 2 to 4 levels of repeating with esp8266. But realized that without two uni-directional separate antennas the efficiency is too low. Of course this can be achieved by raspberry pi or any linux computer with the additional wifi usb card, but cost goes up rapidly..",
