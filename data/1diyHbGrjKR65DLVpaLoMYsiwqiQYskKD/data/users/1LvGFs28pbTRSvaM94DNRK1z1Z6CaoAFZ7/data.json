You charging module based on [tp4056](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Prototyping/TP4056.pdf) wich support up to 8V input voltage.",

I think this voltage difference in case of li-ion batteries may be problem according to this article.\n\nBut you article also says:\n> For example, almost all lithium polymer batteries are 3.7V or 4.2V batteries. What this means is that the maximum voltage of the cell is 4.2v and that the \"nominal\" (average) voltage is 3.7V.",
