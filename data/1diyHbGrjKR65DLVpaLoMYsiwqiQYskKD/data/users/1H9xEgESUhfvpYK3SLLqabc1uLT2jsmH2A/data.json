			"title": "Disabling AAB from AT&T mobile devices.",
			"body": "Most AT&T mobile devices have the AT&T Address Book embedded which will pop up when displaying the Phone's Contacts, even on non-rooted devices this feature can be disabled by doing the following.\n\n1. Type `*#*#2666#*#*` into the dial pad to access the AAB system settings.\n2. Click 'Registration' (3rd option from the top) and then select 'Completed' under the Select Registration Setting\n3. Tap your back button multiple times to exit out of the AAB settings.\n\nThe AT&T Address Book application will no longer prompt to initalise when selecting the phone contacts. Handy for buying / selling refurbished AT&T mobile devices on ebay as the bloat will result in a price reduction. \n\n(It took me forever to refind this info again so I'm placing it here for redundancy.)",
