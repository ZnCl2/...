			"body": "@nofish:\nAs far as I know, it is currently impossible for a zite developer to communicate with the zeronet api, if js cannot be used(if the zite is used with the /raw/ prefix). \nCan you add the ability, to do cmd calls, in a php query kind of way? This would allow for zites, that don't rely on js, to still work, by using html forms to communicate with the api(zeronet client). \n\nHow this could look: \nHave an api page at (for example) 127.0.0.1:43110/api, that just forwards the received cmd to the zeronet client and in an zite.html have something like:\n```\n<form action=\"/api\" method=\"get\">\n  <!--Here is the cmd we want to call. Where 'value' is the name of the comand-->\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"fileWrite\" style=\"display:none\">\n  <!--This are the arguments for the cmd call. Where 'name' is the name of the argument and 'value' the value of that argument-->\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"inner_path\" value=\"data.json\" style=\"display:none\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"content\" value=\"ThisIsSomeTextOneCouldPostSomewhereWithoutJSEnabled.\"><br>\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Safe\">\n</form>\n<form action=\"/api\" method=\"get\">\n  <!--Here is the cmd we want to call. Where 'name' acts as identifier and 'value' is the name of the comand-->\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"sitePublish\" style=\"display:none\">\n  <!--This are the arguments for the cmd call. Where 'name' is the name of the argument and 'value' the value of that argument-->\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"inner_path\" value=\"data.json\" style=\"display:none\"><br>\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"publish\">\n</form>\n```\nFor the 'Safe' button, this will result in: \n`127.0.0.1:43110/api?cmd=fileWrite&inner_path=data.json&content=ThisIsSomeTextOneCouldPostSomewhereWithoutJSEnabled`\nand for the 'publish' button: `127.0.0.1:43110/api?cmd=sitePublish&inner_path=data.json`\n\nWith zites that work without js, the user no longer needs to blindly trust the zite developer, to not include some malicious js(mining crypto/some js exploit/leak the ip to websites outside Zeronet/...).\nThe reason I post this here is, that I don't have a ~~microsoft~~ github account to open an issue there, I would be grateful if someone could open one for me.",

It causes the download of the gitcenter repository for millchan to fail, I have enough space, the zite has sufficient seeders and I know it did download for others. I'm on 0.6.4 rev3738. [This](/15qFg3C9mYTKEAQF678xczTPprbe7b6LMf) is the zite in question, maybe it helps to replicate the bug on nofish's end.",
