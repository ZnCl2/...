If 60% of authors agree to a change and sign it, the update will be injected to the network.\nIn this way if more than 40% of the authors discontinue their work the site would die.\nProblem of disagreement amongst owners exists. It'll be like a senate.\nThe link would be hash0 for the whole time.\nOwners list can be updated during a voting.\nI call this method senateHash.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis gives meaning to the life of Data, instead of Data being dependent on Authors keys.\nData will evolve to a BlockTree.\n\nWhat do you think?",
