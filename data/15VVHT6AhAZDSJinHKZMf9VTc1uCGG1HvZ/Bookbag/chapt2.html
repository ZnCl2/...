<P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat Field liked to build things.  In fact he always had a dream of building a robotic dog.  This dream began when he was a young boy watching the original Dr Who TV show, 
	where 
	there was a robotic dog.  Later when Wheat was 13 or 14 years old he found himself sitting in a boring class at school.  While sitting there he started drawing a dog on one of his 
	class papers.  It was the beginning of a design he would refine over the years.   A few years later he started to build a prototype of that robotic dog.  
	 Sometimes while working on the design of the robot dog, he would listen to music.</FONT></p> 

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>He knew that he would need more money to make his dream of building a robot dog a reality.  Unfortunately the only assets he had were about $2,000 worth of stock in a 
	   company.  
	   He got most of the money to invest in that stock from a small inheritance he received from his grandfather.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Most of Wheat's family were lower class blue color wage slaves.  The one exception that he was aware of was his mother's father.  
	  His maternal grandfather Charles Bounty was part owner in a book printing company that was in the family for generations.  When Charles Bounty died, the business was sold.  
	  The assets were divided among his children.  His only grandchild Wheat was 12 years old at the time, and he only received about $1.400 and he only got that because Mr Bounty 
	  specifically put that in Wheat's name.</FONT></p>  

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>A few years later after Charles Bounty's children almost totally blown the large financial windfall, his grandson Wheat had turned that $1,400 into over $2,000 by investing it in 
	  the stock market.  One fact is clear, if Mr Bounty had not specifically sat that small token of $1,400 aside in Wheat's name, his children would have made sure that Wheat did not get 
	  one red cent.</FONT></p>    

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>And so, Wheat needed much more money to fund his robotic dog project.  His mom (who couldn't stop him from receiving the $1,400 after blowing the windfall) told him the way to get 
	  the money was to "get a job".    So, after his 18th birthday Wheat got his first full time job working at a furniture factory.  Although it was hard manual labor for an hourly wage, 
	  Wheat was proud.  He was learning to shape various hardwoods, mainly oak into furniture, and getting paid to do it.  There is a feeling of accomplishment any real man feels by doing 
	  productive work, making things.  This was the first time Wheat felt that way.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now, Wheat was so busy working hard trying to do the best job he can that he didn't notice the turnover rate for the factory.  Since this was his first job, he didn't know how hard 
	  of a place to work at it was.  Many people would quit their first or second day.  Wheat showed up everyday before the start of the shift.  
	   Another thing Wheat didn't know at the time is that he was assigned to the hardest department in the plant.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>He was working next to a woman who spoke to him like he was a slave.  She rode him hard.  She would yell at him to work harder, and he would endure it.  
	 He didn't know that she was going to the department supervisor behind his back.</FONT></p>  
	 
	 
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat is a lazy teenager right out of high school," she was saying to the boss in his office.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Let me know if he continues to slack off," Bill replied, "I'll give you another 2 days to see if he can get his shit together."</FONT></p>


       <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Ok, Bill," Tiffany spoke, as she walked away disappointed that she couldn't get that young punk fired.</FONT></p>

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat endured two more days of being chewed out by Tiffany the terrible.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat, if you don't get your shit together," she yelled, "you won't have a job here."</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat just silently nodded his head and worked as hard as he could.  He remember the summer he turned 14 how he got a part time job working as a janitor's assistant for 
	  the school district he was attending at the time.  He worked hard scrubbing floors, desks and such things while the school was shut down for summer vacation.  
	  While the head janitor of the school was a man, the people he was working directly with were females, specifically teenage girls a few years older than him.   
	  One day at the end of his first week, a female manager he never saw before spoke with him.</FONT></p> 
	  
	  <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat," she began, "I am told you are a slacker.  This is a warning, you are going to have to work harder if you want to keep this job."</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>A week later she walked up to Wheat and told him he was fired from his part time janitor assistant job.  And so Wheat worked hard and did the best job he could do at the 
	  furniture factory because he did not want to get fired again.</FONT></p>

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>Then one day after break time Tiffany walked over to Wheat.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Bill wants to speak with you in his office."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat walked into the boss's office, knowing he might be getting fired or perhaps just a warning.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I was told you wanted to speak with me."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You are not pulling your share of the work load in this department," Bill began, "this is a warning, I'll give you a few days to step up your game."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I'll work harder," Wheat told Bill as he nodded his head.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>For the rest of the work day as Wheat was doing his job, he was fighting a battle with himself in his own mind.  There was a part of him who wanted to prove he could be 
	 a good productive worker at the factory.  However, there was a growing awareness in him that no matter how hard he worked, he was not welcome there.  
	 At the end of the day  he walked to the office of the President of the company.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Smith, I have a question."</FONT></p>	
	 
	  <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What is it?" Mr Smith asked.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I was told that if I was planning to quit my job, I would have to give a certain amount of days notice," Wheat began, "I am here to give notice, how much notice should I 
	give."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The look on Mr Smith's face was a mixture of surprise and relief.  Surprise because most people who quit, do not give notice at all.  
	Relief because, both the Tiffany and Wheat's supervisor have approached Mr Smith in the last few days to ask when Wheat was going to be fired.  
	Now he no longer had to tell one of his employees that he was fired.</FONT></p>


    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Thank you for offering to give notice that you are going to quit.  How about if we call today your last day?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Ok" Wheat replied, glad it was over.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat walked out and down to his grandmother's house to visit.</FONT></p>

    
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The next morning Tiffany was told that Wheat was no longer working there.  At first break she approached Mr Smith.</FONT></p>
    
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Looks like you are going to need to hire someone to replace Wheat, since he quit."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yes, I am looking at applications this afternoon."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"A lady I worked with at my old job recently applied," Tiffany started, "Her name is Sandy Drake, She would be an excellent worker here.  
	Could you consider her for the position in my department."</FONT></p>	
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>Later in the afternoon while Mr Smith was looking over the applications as he has done many times throughout the years that he was President of the furniture factory, 
	something was bothering him. He couldn't keep the image of  Wheat out of his mind. There was something about the way Wheat spoke to him with such honor and integrity. 
	Before he could make a decision about who he was going to hire, he had to talk to some other supervisors and employees.</FONT></p>

	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Fred, I want your opinion about something. Do you remember Wheat?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You talking about the young man who quit yesterday afternoon?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yes," Mr Smith continued, "I know he wasn't in your department, but you must have seen him working."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Every time I saw him as I walked past an area that he was at, he was always working," Fred went on, "in fact I was disappointed to hear he quit, because he was the type 
   of worker I like to have in my department."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Mr Smith spoke to a few more people before he made the phone call.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Hello,"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"May I speak to Wheat Field please," Mr Smith said on the phone.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You are speaking with him," Wheat was amazed to here Mr Smith's voice on the phone.</FONT></p> 

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Would you consider returning to work at the furniture factory, but in another department?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Sure, what day do you want me to start."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Tomorrow morning at 6am," Mr Smith said in a take it or leave it way, "You'll report to Fred."</FONT></p> 
	    
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>Fred's department was more detailed oriented.  Wheat got to run some woodworking machinery solo, as well as with other people in a team.  He enjoyed learning to run the machines.  
	Then one day about a week later his old supervisor walked up to him.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat, I need your assistance in my department for a time," Bill spoke with authority.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Since Wheat was taught to respect the boss, he followed Bill to the machine.  There was Tiffany working alone at her machine.  Looks like another person who worked next to her just quit. 
	 On her face was the permanent scowl.   Wheat had mixed emotions about this.  There was a certain pride in being called back to do job because he was the only one who could handle it,
	  after being told he was not good enough.  On the other hand he did not want to go back to working with Tiffany on that machine.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat was working there he saw Fred walk over to Bill.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat was assigned to my department," Fred forcefully spoke to Bill, "Don't take him without asking."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat was walking back to Fred's department, he felt an enormous relief.</FONT></p> 


<P><FONT SIZE=2>The furniture factory paid both an hourly wage and also paid a bonus to people who produced a high rate during their work week.  Most people got some bonus pay included in their paycheck.  
Some who worked really hard and had no problems with a machine would get higher bonus pay.  This was affected by many things.  Something could go wrong with a machine, it could break down 
suddenly.  So, bonus pay was partly luck but mostly hard work and skill. Checks were doled out at first break on Friday.</FONT></p>
	
	   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"WHAT THE HELL," Jim yelled as he opened his check, "THERE IS NO BONUS."</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat looked over at Jim. They were both working at the same machine cutting boards.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"WHAT THE FUCK OR YOU LOOKING AT," Thug Jim yelled at Wheat.
    Jim was a Thug. While he was bigger than the average man, he had to take plenty of steroids to get that edge.  He was furious that he was stripped of the bonus he was expecting that week.
	 Seeing some thin 5 foot 7 tall 18 year old looking over at him only infuriated him more.  He put his paycheck into his pocket and turned the machine on.  
	 Jim fed lumber into one end of the machine and it would cut a pattern in the boards.  Wheat was responsible for stacking the boards as they rolled out the other end of the machine.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The boards rolled out faster and faster, until Wheat could not keep up.  Some of the boards were falling on the floor at the end of the belt as Wheat was working as fast as he could 
	 stacking the boards. Then when there were no more boards rolling through the machine, Wheat picked the few boards that fell off the floor and stacked them. As he was doing this out of 
	 the corner of his eye, he could see Jim at the other end of the machine, walking around sticking his chest out, flexing his neck and shoulders like a rooster.  
	 Years later Wheat would recognize this exact "rooster dance" done by a steroid pumped professional wrestler on TV, after winning a fight.</FONT></p>
