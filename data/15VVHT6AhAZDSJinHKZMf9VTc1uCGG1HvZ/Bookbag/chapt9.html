<P><FONT SIZE=2>The night before the election, Wheat Field printed many slips of paper with his name on each of them.  
 The reason for doing this was because there was a local office to be decided at his local voting poll, and no one was on the ballot for that office.  He was going to ask 
 
 people to write his name in for that office.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The polls opened at 7am.  Aside from the few early voters, things were slow for the first few hours.  When someone would show up to vote, Wheat was standing outside 
	 to ask them if they would consider writing his name on the ballot for committeeman.  Most seemed friendly and respectful enough.  However, there were a few people who 
	 blew Wheat off in a passive hostile way.   One thing Wheat did take serious notice, almost everyone he saw showing up to vote appeared to be older than 40 even 50.  
	 Then around 11am the first person showed up who was under the age of 30.</FONT></p>
	  
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I wasn't planning to be here until later this afternoon or evening," Jeff started to speak as he walked up to Wheat Field.  Jeff appeared to be of an age between 25 
	 and 30 years old.  He had a high and tight haircut and showed up early to defend his turf.  The person who called Jeff to warn him that some young 19 year old punk 
	 was after his committeeman seat, turned out to be one of the few people who rudely blew Wheat off earlier.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat Field talked with Jeff the committeeman during slow times when they were not hustling for votes.  They were each asking people who showed up to the polls to 
	write their name in.  The people had to chose.  Jeff and Wheat had no major disagreements, it just so happened that the both wanted the committeeman seat, and only 
	one was going to win it.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat stayed late to get the results.  It turned out he was only able to get one other person to write his name in for the committeeman seat, bringing his total vote 
	total up to 2 votes.  Jeff won the write in contest with 12 total votes.  They shook hands and parted ways.  Wheat knew he would have to come up with a better plan to 
	win.  Even in losing, he saw the seeds of future victory.</FONT></p>
