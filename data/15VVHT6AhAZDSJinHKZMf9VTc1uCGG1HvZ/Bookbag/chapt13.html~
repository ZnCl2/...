 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Are you sure you want to do this?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I have to do this," Wheat answered.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Ok, once you get out of the car," Jason spoke in a serious tone, "you are on your own."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>It was just before midnight when they started driving past the landfill property.  Wheat was wearing a dark sweatshirt with a hood pulled around his head and a 
   dark cloth over his face.  Sitting in the passenger of Jason's car if it was possible to see the look on his face, it would be the look of inescapable determination.  
   He had to see what was contained inside that schoolhouse, no matter what the cost. Even if losing his life was the price he had to pay, he was going to find out what 
   was hidden there.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What the hell?" Jason had just noticed some large 18 wheelers with lights on near the edge of the landfill.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"There is not suppose to be activity in the landfill at night," Wheat was saying, "In fact they usually close the gate before 8pm."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"That activity is at the other side of the landfill, so they shouldn't notice me stopping for a few seconds to drop you off near the school."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yeah, it looks like all their attention is focused at the southwest corner of the landfill."</FONT></p>

 
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>The men who were unloading the equipment off the trucks were flown in by private jet 12 hours ago.  No one within 500 miles had ever seen these men before.  
	 Standing next to a Lincoln town-car was a man wearing a dark suit watching the men unload and carry the equipment into a building that was constructed within the last 
	 hour. Sometimes one of the men who were working would walk up to the man in the suit. A few words would be exchanged and then he would go back to working with the 
	 other men while the man in the suit continued to watch. Since he wearing a fedora, the only thing people could see from a distance about his face was a partially 
	 greying beard and a cigar.  Suddenly one of the men started walking fast, almost running toward the man in the suit.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Dr Konavich," William was talking in a hushed tone just above a whisper, as was standard protocol, "a car was spotted stopping momentarily near the 
	 schoolhouse."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>As William walked back to the truck, Dr Konavich pulled a phone out of an inner suit pocket. He slowly pulled the cigar out of his month as he dialed 
	 a phone number.</FONT></p> 


    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Jason decided to stop at a tavern and have a glass of whiskey on the rocks after dropping Wheat Field off near the school.  He rarely drinks any alcoholic beverages, 
	much less hard whiskey, but he needed it tonight. He sat down at the bar and ordered a glass of single-malt scotch on the rocks.</FONT></p>


    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat didn't bother with the front door of the schoolhouse.  He walked around the back and found a smaller backdoor.  In less than a min he was walking through the 
	doorway.  There were a number of desks and chairs in the building. One of the desks was about 3 times larger than the rest. Near the large desk was a leather chair.  
	In the center of the room stood a wood-stove.  The stove had a pipe that connected to a stone chimney.  This chimney had to be almost 4 feet in diameter.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>It only took Wheat a minute to realize the chimney did not fit in with the rest of the building. He knew there was no way the simple wooden floor could hold the weight 
	of the chimney.  He began to closely examine the chimney on all sides. Then about 3 feet from the floor on the side opposite the stove he found what he was looking for.</FONT></p>
	
	 

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>He pulled the old key out of the cigar box and slowly inserted it into the matching pattern in the stone. At first he wasn't sure if it would work, because it would not 
   turn.  He increased the pressure slightly and suddenly there was a click as it turned.  As this happened a small doorway opened in the chimney.  He had to hunch over and
    almost crawl through, this is how small the doorway was. When he reached around and retrieved to key, the door began to slowly reseal itself behind him.</FONT></p>


    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Jason quickly finished his whiskey and walked out of the tavern.  The reason he did this is because while he was drinking his whiskey, he notice 2 men in dark suits 
	wearing fedoras at the end of the bar.  This was the type of place that you never see men in suits during the day, much less around midnight.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Jason was driving down the road he was reasonably sure there was no one following him. Still, there was something about those 2 men at the tavern, that gave him a 
	bad feeling. As he was driving up a hill he noticed a slow moving pickup truck hauling a trailer behind it. On the trailer there was a cub cadet riding mower, and 
	various tools.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The truck was only moving about 20 miles per hour up the hill. Jason decided to pass the truck.  He started passing the truck he heard a loud noise as the driver of 
	the pickup floored the throttle. The back wheels of the pickup started smoking. As this happened Jason floored the pedal in his car. Because the pickup was pulling 
	the trailer he wasn't going to be able to keep Jason from passing him.  Jason's car was accelerating faster than the pickup truck. He was almost passed the pickup when 
	suddenly the driver of the truck did a hard left and rammed his car.  The force of the impact caused Jason's car to flip over the side of the road and tumble down about
	 20 feet into a ravine.  The truck didn't even slowdown as it sped away.</FONT></p>
	 
<P><FONT SIZE=2>Inside the chimney there was a steel ladder leading down.  The hidden chimney door continued slowly resealing behind him as he made his way down the ladder.</FONT></p>   
  
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The chimney ladder extended down about 200 total feet.  About every 9 feet there was a triangular shaped ledge just off to the side.  These ledges were there so those 
	 using the ladder could stop to rest, especially since anyone traveling through would most likely be carrying equipment and supplies.</FONT></p>  

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>When Wheat Field reached the ground level, he pulled out the map.  According to the map he was in an underground network of artificially constructed caves and 
	  corridors.  While some areas of the ground were bare dirt, other areas looked like carved bedrock.  The walls were mostly solid carved rock.  However, there were 
	  a few walls at various locations constructed of brick, some of steel plating etc.  On the map there was a corridor that intersects the one he was in about 500 feet 
	  west.  What really puzzled him is the pattern he noticed on the map.  It looked like the standard map symbol for railroad tracks.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>He started walking toward the intersection.  Sure enough, there were railroad tracks running in the corridor.  It was a railroad tunnel.  Wheat looked down and got a 
	 closer look at the tracks. From the appearance of the rust and track condition, he estimated that a train hadn't passed over these tracks for at least 10 years.  
	 After a momentary pause, he continued on his journey west another 200 feet.  This course would take him almost directly beneath of where Dr Konavich was standing, 
	 smoking a cigar.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Suddenly he reached a dead end.  According to the map, this end of the corridor is supposed to connect with a series of chambers or caverns.  He was standing there 
	thinking about the situation, when he noticed music. He approached the wall where the music was emanating from.  There was a slot similar to the one in the chimney at 
	the schoolhouse.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>After inserting the key and turning it, a small 9 inch square panel slid open beside the key.  Inside the recessed panel he could see a lighted keypad. However, 
	 Wheat had no idea what the access code could be. He opened his bookbag to see if there was anything that could help him solve the problem.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>He typed "1885" onto the keypad and pressed the enter button.  The only thing that happened was the digits he previously enter flashed for about 5 seconds then 
	disappeared.  The screen was blank again.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Idiot," Wheat whispered to himself, "I was assuming it was a 4 digit combination like an ATM machine."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Realizing his error when he remembered that the display was 8 digits in length, he started punching numbers into the keypad.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>"1-8-8-5-1-9-6-2"</I></FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>This time as the numbers on the display were blinking, a doorway started to reveal itself.  The music immediately increased in volume as the large 2 foot wide layered 
	door slowly opened.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The inside walls and floor were of polished black granite, in stark contrast to the rough stone corridor on the other side of the entrance.  The room was perfectly 
	square with each side being 12 foot long, including the 12 foot high ceiling.  It was like being inside a perfectly polished cube. There were only 3 things in this 
	cube besides Wheat Field, a rug about 5 foot square in the center of the room, and 2 long sofas.  The sofas were directly across from the rug opposite each other.</FONT></p> 
     
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat walked over to the sofa on his right and carefully sat down at the end.  The material was unlike anything he ever felt before.  It was like a combination of the 
	best leather, and a soft suede fabric, with a hint of the finest silk. The  music he heard earlier appeared to be omnipresent.  Somehow the sofa was transferring the 
	sound-waves in greater complexity directly into his body.  He was living the music.  Sitting there with his eyes closed feeling the greatness of the symphony inside 
	him he suddenly heard a voice had hadn't heard in years.</FONT></p>
	 
 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You've arrived precisely within the hour predicted,"  Dr John Geiklan was saying, as the door on the other side of the room slowly resealed itself.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Dr Geiklan sat down in the opposite sofa across the rug from Wheat Field.  At each of the sofas a 12 inch square column of granite began to slowly rise from the floor.
	  They stopped about 2 feet higher than the arm of the sofas.  While to top and 3 of the sides of each column were solid polished granite, the side facing each of them 
	  was not.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Dr Geiklan reached over to the column for the purpose of opening a small glass panel door.  There was no handle that Wheat could see on the glass panel facing him.  
	He looked over to see Dr Geiklan press against the right side of the glass panel.  There was a click, then the panel opened.  Behind the glass in the column various 
	items have been prepared.  These were as follows:  freshly brewed hot tea, a porcelain plate, and a cloth drawstring bag.  On the plate were extra sharp white cheddar 
	cheese, and green olives. The drawstring bag was infused with gourmet dehydrated meats.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>They exchanged a few words of minor significance as they enjoyed the tea and food.  Then there was a sound of movement from inside the columns.  Wheat looked inside 
	and noticed a cigar, complete with a butane torch and ashtray. As they were puffing on the cigars Dr Geiklan spoke.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Watch closely"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Then suddenly Dr Geiklan pressed the lit end of his cigar against the fabric of the sofa.  When he pulled it back, there was no mark on the fabric.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What type of fabric is that?" Wheat was impressed.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Without saying a word, Dr Geiklan took his butane torch, turned it on full blast and held the flame against the sofa.</FONT></p> 

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wow!"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The fabric is something one of our best teams designed at the laboratory," Dr Geiklan said after taking a few more puffs from his cigar.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"It is bullet proof, acid proof, and can withstand all but the highest powered lasers.  In fact we have to use a special high powered laser whenever we need to cut the 
	fabric.  This will be used to make the next bookbags issued to our members.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"When can I have a bookbag constructed of that fabric?"</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"All in do time," Dr Geiklan said with the barest hint of a smile, and twinkle in his eye, "There is someone I have to introduce you to."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The hidden door at the side of the cube opposite the one Wheat entered opened. They stepped out into a hallway and continued walking.  The walls, ceiling and floor of 
	the hallway were of polished copper. There was a rubber sheet about 2 inches thick on the floor for them to walk over.  This was to prevent any possible conduction of 
	electromagnetic radiation between the copper floor and the people traveling through the hallway.  After walking about 25 feet, they came upon the end of the hallway.  
	A camera was mounted above the large door.  As they approached, the door autocratically opened for them.  They walked through without slowing down.</FONT></p>

 <P><FONT SIZE=2>The room they entered was about 25 feet wide and about 50 feet long, with a ceiling about 10 feet high.  On one side, along the length of the room, were various 
	 pieces of equipment.  Wheat noticed some people carrying a heavy piece of machinery through the door at the far end of the room.  They sat it down beside another 
	 similar looking machine.  An other group of people were wearing blue lab coats, pants, and face masks walked over to the machines.  They each carried a blue toolbox.  
	 The men in the blue lab coats started working on the new machinery.  They appeared to be connecting the 2 machines together.</FONT></p>
     
	 
	  <P><FONT SIZE=2>In the middle of the room were a row of desks with leather chairs behind them.  The desks were facing the center of the other long wall.  In the center of the wall 
	  was some type of window about 20 feet wide.  It appeared to be tinted and about 3 feet thick.  Wheat looked through the window.</FONT></p>
	  
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>The floor on the other side of the window was about 2 feet lower than the floor in the room they currently occupied.  The ceiling of that room was 
	about 4 feet higher.  There was people wearing various colored lab coats working on the machinery.  One of the machines had a huge silver coil about 5 feet in 
	diameter total.  It looked like a giant doughnut.  There were 2 more giant donuts lined up.  However, those other doughnuts appeared to be constructed of some type 
	of dark brown material.  Along the far wall were tanks of various liquids and gasses.</FONT></p>
     
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Dr Geiklan and Wheat Field walked over to an oval shaped conference table surrounded by leather chairs.  This was an area of the room behind the row of desks, raised 
	 about 12 inches above the surrounding floor of the room.  This made it easier for the people to watch the activities happening in the other room.  Wheat recognized one
	  of the people sitting at the table, as the president of the local landfill division.  Beside him was a man wearing a dark suit and a fedora hat.</FONT></p>
     
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat Field," Dr Geiklan began, "It is my pleasure to introduce you to Dr Konavich, the director of this laboratory."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"It is an honor to meet you," Wheat said as he reached over to shake Dr Konavich's hand.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"No," Dr Konavich corrected him, "the honor is mine."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat and Dr Geiklan each sat down in chairs at the conference table. Dr Konavich began to speak.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Field, first I have some unfortunate information to give you concerning your driver, Jason."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What happened?" Wheat showed no hint of shock or surprise, because he had mentally prepared himself for a series of worst case scenarios.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"It seems a demon was able to have enough influence over a driver of a pickup truck, causing him to ram Jason's car off the road.  Fortunately, I was able to assign 
	two of my best agents to watch out for Jason's safety, and should anything happen to him, they were to immediately take action on my behalf."</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What condition is he in?" Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"He is currently recovering with a broken leg at our medical facility."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"And the driver?"</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The three men at the table looked at each other, then looked at Wheat.  The landfill president touched the surface of the table in front of him. It lit up as the 
   president started using the touchscreen interface.  In the center of the table there was a glass crystal cube about 18 inches square.  Inside the cube a holographic 
   image of the landfill appeared.  As the president manipulated his touchscreen panel, the image zoomed to a location of the landfill with a red pickup.  They could see 
   a real-time holographic motion of men with cutting torches scrapping the truck.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"As you can see the truck is currently being recycled.  As for the driver, he is being held at an underground facility in Wyoming," Dr Konavich stated.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Field," Dr Geiklan began speaking seriously about the situation, "when you first joined Order of the Bookbag about 3 years ago, I explained how demons are 
	 influencing and possessing key people in positions of authority.  From the research we have been able to do, we know that powerful demonic entities do in fact hold 
	 most of the key positions in government."
    "Now, the man driving the pickup truck was not possessed of a demon at first.  Jason, your driver was the real target of the demonic forces of evil.  However, as Jason 
	was not an initiate into Order of the Bookbag, he did not have the full protection that comes with membership.  Being a close associate did offer enough protection so 
	that the demon could not influence Jason directly."</FONT></p>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>"Also, because these demons are of some extra dimensional entity, they seem to have the ability to see possible future events," Dr Geiklan continued, "It is likely 
	that one of the demons foreseeing Jason eventually passing the pickup truck, was able to deduce that the path of least resistance was to influence and attempt to 
	possess the driver of the pickup truck."</FONT></p>
 
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Now," Dr Konavich began to speak, adding to the discussion, "While everyone including ourselves can feel or be affected by these inter-dimensional demonic entities, 
	 they can only have a sustained or continuous influence on a small percentage of the population."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Are you saying that I have been influenced by demons too?" Wheat Field asked.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Did you ever have an irrational thought, or be motivated to do something," Dr Konavich was saying, "that you later regretted, because there was no doubt as to the 
	 immorality of that action or motivation?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Before Wheat could answer, Dr Konavich continued, "Sometimes it may only be a split second, a momentary lapse of reason, before we catch ourselves, this comes from 
	somewhere, because everything has a cause."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"While these small temporary indiscretions do cause some trouble to our world," Dr Geiklan was speaking now, "the true danger to the future of our world is from that 
	percentage of people who are under constant influence from these demonic forces.  Possessed, is simply defined as someone who is almost completely and continuously 
	under the influence of a demon or demonic entity."</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The thing that makes these possessed people dangerous is that although they are a small percentage of the population, most of them seek positions of centralized 
	authority and central control over property.  Once they control these central positions of authority, they can expand and leverage the demonic influence over the 
	rest of the population."</FONT></p>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Stone," Dr Geiklan said as he turned to the president of the landfill division, "tell Wheat Field about the home office."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Remember when you were first offered a full-time position at the landfill," Mr Stone began, "how I warned you about the drug test?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yes"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The drug prohibition laws and drug tests are demonically inspired.  The whole purpose is to train and teach people to be treated like cattle. I am just the president 
   of the local landfill who happens to be against these negative forces.  The drug testing policy was ordered by the CEO of the Waste Corporation in Chicago.  That is 
   where the corporation headquarters is located."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The CEO is possessed?" Wheat asked.</FONT></p>
    
   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The larger a corporation or organization is, the more likely the top person in charge will be under demonic influence.  This happens simply because the forces of evil 
   will focus much more effort to acquire a position that has more centralized control of resources and authority.  The parent corporation that owns this landfill happens 
   to be the largest waste corporation in the USA."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"How were you able to hold onto the position of president of this landfill, if you oppose the demonic forces?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I had some help," Mr Stone spoke, "No one at the corporate home office knows about this underground facility.  This is the reason Borace Beindel could not sell the 
	rest of the land to the Waste corporation.  Him and the organization he help to build, had to maintain control of this facility as leverage.  Mr Beindel recognized the 
	threat those demonic forces posed to humanity many years ago.  The original contract he has with the Waste Corporation and landfill, gave him veto over the appointment 
	of the local president in charge of this landfill."</FONT></p>
  	 
  
  <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat sat there and took a drink of his tea, he was beginning to realize the true genius of Mr Beindel.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"As for the drug tests," Mr Stone continued, "the reason for the increasing level of drug testing throughout the waste corporation is to distract from the criminal 
   activity of the CEO and key people on his executive management team."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Criminal activity?" Wheat did hear various rumors about the waste corporation be involve with organized crime, however, he considered such things in 
	jest, at the time.</FONT></p>
	

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The CEO along with some key people on the top executive team are embezzling money from the corporation.  They are falsifying records and accounting.  Whenever the top 
	people in an organization are involved in that or similar activity they will almost immediately embark on a campaign of 'cracking down' on the bottom half of the 
	organizational chart."</FONT></p> 
	
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Meetings will be held, directives issued, memos sent out, rules will start to be tightened or restricted for the lower tier employees, responding to a non-issue.  
	This is mainly to distract from the criminal activity happening at the top of the organizational chart."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat finished his tea.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"It looks like the criminal activity in the top executive team is starting to accelerate."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"How do you know this?" Dr Geiklan asked.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Today I received a message that the CEO is ordering an increase in urine drug testing rates and in 3 months a mobile hair testing lab will be dispatched randomly to 
	all Waste Corporation divisions.  Those at the corporate headquarters in Chicago will be exempt from the drug testing.  Everyone else will have to submit, and anyone 
	who isn't as clean as a nun shall be fired on the spot."</FONT></p> 

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>As they sat around the conference table discussing events and such things, technicians in various colored lab coats were putting together and testing machinery.  
	 There was a team lead by an optical engineer responsible for aligning the massive doughnut shaped pieces in the large room.  The doughnut shape devices create a 
	 powerful magnetic field.  The reason those doughnut devices must be lined up perfectly has something to do with quantum coherence of energy shells surrounding the 
	 nucleus of atoms.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"....... that is why I shall be running for attorney general of Pennsylvania," Dr Geiklan was saying.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat Field," Dr Konavich had turned to him to ask a question, "Are you planning to run for office in the next election?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I narrowed it down to school board or town council," Wheat answered, "I shall decide by the next meeting."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>They discuss their political plans while the technicians were finishing testing out the machinery.  One key thing they had decided was that they were not going to run 
	as republicans or democrats.  It was decided they were forming a new political party.  This party was founded for the purpose of repelling the inter-dimensional 
	demonic problem.  Since the demons could only possess a small percentage of the population, the solution was quite simple.  Convince enough of the good people to run 
	for political office and vote.  If the people knew the true power they really had, they could sweep aside those small percentage of demon infested people like dust.</FONT></p>
	
   <P><FONT SIZE=2>For about 2 seconds there was a loud buzzing noise, like an alarm.  When this happened Dr Konavich stood up.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Excuse me gentlemen, I believe we are almost ready."</FONT></p>

	<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dr Konavich walked over to a man wearing a red lab coat, and they spoke for about 30 seconds.  Then Dr Konavich returned to the conference table.</FONT></p>

	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Unfortunately at this time, we don't even have enough people running for office to take over the government, even if they all won," Dr Geiklan was saying in 
	 frustration, "but suppose we did, and did take over, then what?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"That would not solve the problem of the inter-dimensional demonic invasion," Wheat answered.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Precisely," Dr Geiklan was almost shouting, "in fact there is a very high probability that when we start having political success, there will be a massive desperate 
   focus of demonic energy across the dimensional membrane."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The equipment in this facility was designed to test a theory about the membrane, and find a way to stop this invasion," Dr Konavich was saying.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You are planning to save the world from a landfill?" Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"This is the perfect location for a variety of reasons," Mr Stone began to speak, "however, the most important reason is, our new waste to energy plant we just 
	finished at the corner of the landfill.  Remember the power generating capacity I spoke about at the town council when the energy plant was approved?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yes."

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Obviously I could not tell them the actual capacity of our advanced waste to energy technology," Mr Stone was saying, "that would put us in jeopardy 
	of being 
	discovered."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I can imagine it would take a massive amount of electricity to power this underground base," Wheat was pondering aloud.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"When we are fully operational," Dr Konavich was speaking, "it will take approximately 1 million times the publicly stated electric generating 
	capacity, to power this 
	facility."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The actual generating capacity of our waste to energy system is almost 2 million times what I told the town council," Mr Stone said, with a hint of a smile.  
	Then he leaned back in his chair and lit a cigar.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Presently there were technicians taking seats at the desks that were lined up facing the window into the other room.  At the same time display panels lit up in front
	 of each of the men sitting around the conference table.  The display in front of Wheat Field had some information about a countdown, along with some video feeds from 
	 cameras. While Wheat Field and Mr Stone were just watching their displays, Dr Konavich and Dr Geiklan hands were rapidly moving over their touchscreen interfaces.   
	 As they were working they would periodically glance up at the crystal cube in the center of the table.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Inside the cube the holographic display started to display different images.  While Wheat did recognize some of the images, he soon realized there was something 
	bizarre about some of them.  It was showing different places around the world.  Each for about 2 or 3 seconds then the hologram would suddenly change to another 
	seemingly random image.</FONT></p>
	
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>As this was happening the liquid nitrogen was being pumped through tubes from the tanks to the large doughnut shaped devices.  Some frost was appearing on the 
	cryogenic tubing. What appeared to be smoke emanating from the doughnut devices was really evaporating liquid nitrogen reacting with the surrounding air.  A slow 
	deep hum could be heard and felt throughout the facility.  This hum was steadily increasing in pitch and speed.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Then there was a change in the holograms displaying through the crystal cube.  While the holograms were still images at first, now they were beginning to show action.  
	Instead of a still image of a bird, it the bird's wings would be flapping as it moved through the air.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>When Wheat Field looked down to the display in front of him he saw there was 2 minutes left in the countdown.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>1:59</i></FONT></p>
 
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>Each scene would have more detail and motion as they got closer to the end of the countdown.  There would be a dog walking.  Then people sitting at a table playing 
	 cards in a smoke filled room.  Then from the vantage point of an airplane or helicopter, he would see a city skyline, or a rural area.  One of the holograms showed 
	 a couple in a bed having sex.  Then suddenly there was a scene of a baby crying filling the whole cube.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>1:17</i></FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What the hell?"</FONT></p> 

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What did you see?" Dr Konavich said as he looked up from his display.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I just saw a jet crash into one of the world trade center towers in New York City," Mr Stone said in shock.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>1:10</i></FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat Field and Mr Stone watched the cube as Dr Konavich and Dr Geiklan continued working.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>1:07</i></FONT></p>

  <P><FONT SIZE=2>"MARTHA!" Mr Stone cried out.  He had a look of pain, anguish, and shock on his face.</FONT></p>

  <P><FONT SIZE=2>What Mr Stone saw was 2 different holograms. The first was of him married to Martha with 3 children the youngest being about 7 years old.  The 2nd hologram was of an 
  older Martha and Mr Stone, as grandparents.  But Martha died when she was 24 years old in a plane crash.  They were briefly lovers in high school with then they broke 
  up and went there separate ways.</FONT></p>  
	

 <P><FONT SIZE=2>Over the years Mr Stone always wondered what would have happened if things did work out between them.  At age 24 she married a fellow she met at her work.  They were 
   flying to their honeymoon in Hawaii when the plane they were on crashed into the ocean.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>1:00</i></FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>The holograms that were being displayed in the cube were from parallel universes.  They were opening up a window into these places. Some were almost identical to the 
   one they were in, some were slightly different, some were vastly different.  This technology was based on a new variation of M theory that Dr Konavich and Dr Geiklan
    simultaneously deduced.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>This new M theory, they call the 6 dimensional symmetry.  Up until that point there was the problem of superimposition of the quantum state conflicting with only 
	having 1 dimension of space-time.  There was the conventional 3 spatial dimensions that the most basic geometry student knows about.  The other physicists who 
	previously worked on M Theory were correct that the fabric of the universe was a membrane and that all matter atoms, electrons, were actually strings woven into the 
	fabric of the membrane.  There was no such thing as empty space, the apparent affect of forces from a distance like gravity and electromagnetism were just folds and 
	tensions in the fabric of this membrane.  However, they made one basic flawed assumption.  In order to make their theory fit, they kept on adding more spatial 
	dimensions, while keeping the time dimension at just 1.  So by the time Dr Konavich and Dr Geiklan solved the problem, the leading M Theorist of the day were claiming 
	membranes with 10 or even 11 dimensions, all save 1 were simply extra junk spatial dimension, staying with a single dimension of time.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The solution was simple, spatial geometry should have symmetry with time itself.  And so, we end up with a membrane of 6 total dimensions, 3 geometric, 
	and 3 of time.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>0:45</i></FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Holograms continued to speed up.  There was a scene of a man wearing a military uniform, giving orders to others in a war.</FONT></p>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>Then more random scenes.  Then what appeared to be the same man much younger, possibly a teenager in a car.  The car was being struck by bullets.  There was another 
	young man beside him in the car who appeared to have something wrong with one of his eyes. Then more random holograms.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>0:15</i></FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>When the countdown was down to 15 seconds the holograms were changing so fast, that the cube became a blur.  The acceleration of the holograms continued at such a scale 
   that would approach infinity as the countdown reached zero.</FONT></p>

  <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>0:05</i></FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>The crystal cube was a flashing rainbow of colors.</FONT></p>

  <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>0:03</i></FONT></p>

  <P><FONT SIZE=2>The flashing rainbow of colors were merging together toward white.</FONT></p>

  <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>0:02</i></FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>At this point the cube was becoming a solid white glow and getting brighter.</FONT></p> 

  <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>0:01</i></FONT></p> 

  <P><FONT SIZE=2>At this point there was a noticeable glow that was getting brighter from the other room.  This was emanating from the center of the doughnut devices.</FONT></p> 

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>At the zero mark there would only be a 1 second window where the device could open a gateway into a parallel universe.  The computer was programmed with a triple 
   activation fail-safe interlock.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>0:00</i></FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>At this point the cube was such a bright white glow that no one in the room could look directly at it.  The men who sat at the table had closed their eyes. Dr Konavich 
   and Dr Geiklan were prepared for this moment.  Even with their eyes closed they placed their hands palm facing the touchscreen interface.  The computer recognized not 
   just the pattern on the skin, but also the bone structure and blood vessel patterns.  A third man in another room unaffected by the glow from the cube was watching by 
   closed circuit video.  The third man had to place his hand down on his touchscreen interface at the same time during the window as the other 2 men.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The moment the three men activated the gateway a number of things happened simultaneously. The high pitched sound of the device stopped and there was almost total 
	silence. The glow from the doughnuts disappeared.  The crystal cube stopped glowing white and inside the cube there was a fading still hologram.  The hologram took a 
	few seconds to fade as the men sat there in shock.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What the hell is that?" Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Then Mr Stone burst out laughing. Soon all 4 men at the conference table were laughing. The cube was predicted to stop with the a hologram of a specific 
   event in a 
   parallel universe. This was to be a point across the multidimensional membrane as close to the gateway as possible. However, the event in the cube could be anywhere 
   from fractions of a second to months from the actual gateway point in space-time.</FONT></p>
   
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The fading hologram was both of a man's buttocks over a cardboard box and of a dark brown feces in high-definition 3d frozen in a moment in time as it was falling 
	between the buttocks and the bottom of the box. That was the only thing visible. After a few seconds the hologram faded out from the outside of the cube to the center. 
	This had the added effect because the feces was in the center of the cube, it was the last to disappear.  Then the cube was transparent and empty.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The gateway itself was opened in a spherical area about 18 inches in diameter.  This was directly in front of the doughnut devices.  At the table they played back the 
	 video recorded by the high-speed cameras of the gateway event.
There was a pinpoint of light that rapidly expanded to an 18 inch glowing sphere.  Then the glow collapsed down to a rectangular box shape.   The box itself was momentarily
 glowing then the glow faded as it fell to the floor.</FONT></p>  

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Men in fully contained NBC suits entered the airlock.  After waiting the 15 minutes for the airlock to cycle the door to the gateway chamber opened.  They walked over 
	 to the box and looked it over.  There was a light fog or vapor rolling off the surface.  On the floor were shards of ice that were already beginning to melt. The box 
	 itself seemed to be covered with a thin layer of ice and frost.  The men were scanning the box and surrounding area with hand held radiation meters. There was also a 
	 spectrographic analyzer.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The men at the table were watching all this on their display panels when the voice of one of the men could be heard from the speakers mounted above the table.  
	 With gloved hands one of them had just picked up the box and brushed off the frost on the top surface.  There appeared to be a delivery address along with a date 
	 stamped on the outside of the box.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Dr Konavich," the voice from the speakers was saying, "are you seeing this?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yes"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Watch the monitor while I hold the box up to the camera."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>There was close to 75 people total at various locations throughout the facility, watching the camera feed on monitors.  From one of the desks at the far end of the 
	room could be heard the sound of a coffee mug shattering as it hit the floor.   From another location someone gasped for air in shock.  At the conference table the 3 
	men were momentarily frozen as they saw what was on the outside of the box.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"How could this happen?" Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Dr Geiklan leaned back in his chair as the shock was disappearing from his face.  He reached into an inside pocket and pulled out 3 items.  A cigar cutter, a cigar, 
	and a butane torch.  They sat there for a few moments watching the display.  Then Dr Konavich started working his touchscreen panel.  He was doing calculations and 
	replaying video feeds.</FONT></p>   

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>On the outside of the box was a name, John Konavich.  There was a barcode tracking label, with a shipped by date of December 18, 2012.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I believe it may be from a parallel universe of about 15 years future," Dr Geiklan was saying.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"This was not just a simple lateral shift of energy," Dr Konavich added.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"A lateral shift?" Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Today's date is November 19, 1996," Dr Konavich was explaining, "If this was a simple lateral shift then the latest shipped by date that could be on the label is 
	 November 19, 1996.  Of course it would be a November 19, in a parallel universe along one of the other time dimensions.  Since this box has a shipped date in 2012, 
	 we know that it is along more than one axis in the 3 time dimensional matrix.</FONT></p> 

<P><FONT SIZE=2>"Do we have authorization to open the box?" a voice could be heard from every speaker in the facility.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I hereby grant authorization," Dr Geiklan said as he placed his hand down on his touchscreen panel.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I hereby grant authorization," Dr Konavich said and also placed his hand down on his panel.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I concur," Mr Stone simply said.</FONT></p>  

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>One by one people in the facility repeated the phrase I concur when the panel in front of them started blinking.  Finally the panel in front of Wheat started 
	  blinking.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat?" Dr Geiklan asked.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I concur," Wheat said when he realized it was his turn.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>As soon as Wheat gave approval an alarm sounded for 2 seconds, followed by a computer recording of a warning.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The technicians had a special toolbox. Inside the toolbox there was all types of special tools for manipulation objects. They placed the box in a cabinet with 2 thick 
	glass walls for them to observe it while they prepared the tools.
 Three cameras were pointed at the box.  Just below each glass window was a set of hand insertion tubes.  They placed the tools to be used into a draw and slide the draw 
 into the cabinet.  Then they reached into the tubes and grabbed the tools.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Each technician had a pair of gripper manipulator devices.  They noticed the box was taped shut. One of the technicians pressed a button and a razor blade extended 
	 out of his device.  As the other technician held the box, he carefully began to slide the blade across one of the box seams, slicing the tape.  As soon as the blade 
	 was past the last bit of tape the one side of the box pushed out about 1 quarter inch.  This was nothing more than the releasing of the tension that the box had from 
	 the tape on it.  Nevertheless, there was a sudden sound of someone gasping for air then the breathing was normal again.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>A few people at various locations in the facility sighed in relief at this point.  However, it wasn't over.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>One technician looked across at the other, when he saw the sweat dripping off his coworker's face, he realized he was also sweating.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Ready?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Let's do this."</FONT></p>

 <P><FONT SIZE=2>They slowly opened the box. It was only their intensive training spent in simulators that stopped them from jumping or having a serious reaction.</FONT></p> 

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Shouts and loud talking could be heard throughout the facility.  For some strange reason Mr Stone was taking a sip of coffee when he saw the inside of the box. 
   Coffee was instantly propelled out of his mouth onto the conference table in front of him.</FONT></p>  

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>At this point Dr Konavich worked the panel in front of him for a few seconds.  This caused a column to descend from the ceiling above to the table. Under the column a 
   robotic cleaning device took care of the coffee mess.  On the side of the column was a tray holding glasses with ice in them, along side a large bottle of scotch.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Gentlemen," Dr Konavich began, "I don't know about the rest of you, but after that, I need a drink."</FONT></p>
         
    
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What about the contents of the box?" Mr Stone asked.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The feces shall be tested at the laboratory," Dr Konavich said.</FONT></p>	  
	 
	 
<P><FONT SIZE=2>"Dr Konavich," Wheat asked, "Do you have a relative named John Konavich?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I once had an older brother named John Konavich.  After he graduated high school he went into the seminary to train for the priesthood.  He was about to be ordained 
	when he was under continued assault by demons.  Eventually he  was committed to a mental institution.  It was during my conversations with him at the  mental 
	institution that I started to formulate my theory about the inter-dimensional demonic entities."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"We originally set the machine to open a gateway at a random coordinate laterally close to our own time-frame," Dr Geiklan was saying, "Looking at the replays of the 
	holograms and what came through the gateway, it appears that the gateway coordinates are somehow affected by the people involved in running the machine itself."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"We may have to suspend gateway operations for awhile so we can crunch the data"</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>They spoke for a time at the table then it was time to adjourn the meeting.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"It it settled we meet at the Bull Dog tavern in one month to recruit candidates for next year's election," Dr Geiklan said.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>For the next few months they worked to find and recruit candidates to run for office among other things.</FONT></p>
