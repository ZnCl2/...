    All characters appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.  
     This work is based on events taking place in a parallel universe, as such it is clearly fiction in our universe. 
																						 <br>
     There are some names and events that are borrowed from our universe:  Example Sam Walton founder of Walmart, Jesse Ventura, etc.  
  In those select cases the use of such names and events surrounding them are “fair use”.  The reason is to show the similarity of the universe of this 
  story to our own, and to set a basic framework for the story.
