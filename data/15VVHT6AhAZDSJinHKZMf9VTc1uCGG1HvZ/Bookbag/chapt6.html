<P><FONT SIZE=2>At the time, Wheat was working a part time job at an air conditioner factory.  He was only asked to do basic labor, like moving boxes, painting stuff, cleaning up.  
	There was an elderly man and everyone called him Dick.  He was the first person that Wheat met in real life who was called by the name Dick.  Wheat did not want to call the man Dick.  
	Also, he noticed a certain comical sneer when people would say the man's first name.  Wheat thought the old man deserved to be addressed with more respect than that.  
	One day Wheat was able to discover Dick's last name.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>He waited until he had to speak to the old man about something.  You see, Wheat never addressed him as Dick.  Instead he would walk up to him if he need to speak with him about something 
	and say, "excuse me," or something similar.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Williams," Wheat was preparing to ask Dick for assistance, "I have a question."</FONT></p> 

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Seeing Dick's face light up, it was now clear to Wheat how much being addressed with respect, meant to him.  At that moment he was glad that he never called him by his 
	 first name.</FONT></p>


     <P><FONT SIZE=2>There was a woman who worked in a department near where Wheat was working.  She did not appear to be the type of woman, that Wheat would like to see naked.  
	 She was built like a cabbage patch doll on steroids.  She even had a cabbage patch face.  Any conversations that happened between her and Wheat remained strictly job related.  
	 One day Wheat noticed she was in a worse mood than usual. In fact he never really saw her smile.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I won't be here tomorrow," Jason said, "I have to testify at an unemployment hearing."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Why, is that?"  Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"That creep, Samuel is trying to collect unemployment after he got fired."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Oh, I didn't know he was fired"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yeah, he spoke to Gina in a disrespectful and offensive way."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat thought – perhaps he called her a cabbage patch looking bitch or something.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What did he say"</FONT></p>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>"He was asking Gina out on a date and she turned him down," Jason continued speaking about the incident like he was describing a rape or murder, "and when she turned him down, 
   he told her – 'I guess you just aren't a two guy kind of girl' , and so she immediately went to HR."</FONT></p>
   
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat was working he was puzzled about the man getting fired. He had fleeting thoughts about something being wrong, but he couldn't wrap his mind around the problem.  
	There seem to be a united outrage about what this man did, and there was general agreement that he deserved to be fired.  Still, there was no other witnesses to the actual event.  
	Something about a man getting fired simply from the word or accusation of a woman bothered Wheat.  He thought perhaps he was wrong to think this way.  
	He stopped thinking about it and turned his thoughts back to his job, and back to raising money for his dream of building a robotic dog.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat worked there for a few more weeks.  Then at the end of one day, he was told it was his last day.</FONT></p>
