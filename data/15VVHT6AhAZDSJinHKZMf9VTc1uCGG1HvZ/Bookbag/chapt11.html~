<center><h1>Chapter 11 Creeps and Perverts</h1></center>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>At the end of each December the extended family of Wheat Field would gather for an afternoon feast. There were usually 2 or 3 such gatherings a year.  Usually the 
	 event would take place at one of Wheat's grandparent's houses.  Throughout his childhood he experienced this tradition.  Aunts, Uncles, cousins, and such would 
	 arrive during the late morning and once everyone was there, they would all sit down to a big feast.  After the feast, the family would usually gather into 3 groups.</FONT></p>
	   

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>First there would be the men sitting around discussing, business, politics, philosophy, and sometimes sports.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Then there were the children running around doing what children do.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The third group were the gossiping women.</FONT></p>  

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now because Wheat was naturally curious, as the years passed, he would spent less and less time with the children and more time with the adults.  He usually split 
   the time between the women and the men, listening to what they have to say.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>It was much easier for him to make sense of what the men were talking about, than the musings of the women.</FONT></p>

 <P><FONT SIZE=2>The women would talk about who died within the last year, people getting sick, babies being born, people getting married.  They would usually start speaking about real 
 people, some of whom Wheat recognized the names.  Then suddenly without warning the their conversations would get bizarre, speaking about people cheating and strange 
 things.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>".......Oh I missed last week's show, so I didn't realize she was cheating on Roger with that hunk," Sally was saying.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>SHOW?  They are talking about a TV show!</FONT></p>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>It was so bizarre to Wheat.  These women suddenly were talking about people on a TV show.  They would gossip about real people and events, then suddenly with no warning 
they would be talking about artificial characters in a TV show, as if they were just as real.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>These were old traditions that were slowly fading away.  Wheat's childhood was in the 1980s when there was still a greater residual inertia of wealth and family bonds 
   still in existence in America.  As he got older he noticed a subtle shift in what the adults were speaking about.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The men would speak of some future danger, of some threat to the nation and culture.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"....... and the big corporations are merging to crush the middle class," Fredrick was saying.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yes, it looks like the blue color working man is in trouble..........."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>".......there could be a war......"</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Sometimes Wheat would hear such talk from the women, but it was much more rare, and when they did speak that way it was religious based.  
	 Women mostly gossiped.</FONT></p> 

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The last few years of his childhood as he was preparing to become a man, he began to notice a different attitude emanating from the women in some of the conversations 
	 he overheard.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Men are so lucky," Ethel spoke, "they have it so easy."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"They have the best jobs and get paid more money," Rachel added.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>These type of statements were confusing to Wheat, because he never noticed any advantages to being a boy.  It would be awesome when he got older and could enjoy the 
	extra privileges of being a man, he had heard women speaking about.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The younger and better looking women would speak of men in an even more negative tone.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"There are perverts at my work," Aunt Susan was saying with utter contempt, "I caught them looking at me."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>While he did hear the word pervert spoken by females a few times previously, this family gathering at the end of December 1995 after losing his job at the warehouse 
   was the first time he heard the word creep.  He didn't know the meaning of those words, but could tell that they were words that only applied to bad men.</FONT></p>
      
  
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>That winter there was one of the biggest blizzards, also known as a snowstorm ever. He knew it may be the last time he built a snow fort.  As the snow was melting and 
	he was fighting the losing battle to save his snow fort, he saw a neighbor walking toward his fort.  She was the type of female he would love to have the pleasure of 
	her body.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I am going to go smoke some pot," she was telling Wheat.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Of course Wheat followed her away from the fort to go smoke some pot.  In the pot smoking room, were, two other guys besides Wheat and the girl. She talked about how 
	some dude named Chad wanted to be her boyfriend, and what a pathetic joke of a boy he was.  Even before taking the first puff, he had thoughts of what it would be like 
	to run his hands up and down her naked body.  No one ever knew how he was sitting there fighting a battle against his desires.</FONT></p>


   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat remembered all his life since being a young child, hearing about the evil of the desires of the man. Girls and ladies were pure and virtuous.  It was impossible 
   for a female to have a sexual desire. Sure, ladies did have sex, but only to please her husband or boyfriend after he courted her and was friends with her for a time.  
   He remembered hearing his aunts and other older female relatives talking among themselves about male privilege and as a boy didn't understand what that was.  Part of 
   him felt sorry for the women.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now that he was turning into a man he felt ashamed that he was having these feelings of desire for sharing the pleasure of his body with a lady.  He desired to have 
	her, even without spending time courting her first.</FONT></p> 

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I must resist these nasty thoughts. I do not want to be a pervert or a creep.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Ladies should be respected........please God give me the strength to defeat this evil that is tempting me.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>It was not easy, but he won the battle with his dark nature that day.  Sometimes he would have thoughts of what it would be like to undress that neighbor lady.  It 
	was hard to overcome that evil desire inside him. He would go out of his way to avoid being around her.  Looking out the window to make sure she was not out there, 
	before going outside to check the mail, and other such things.   Later the following summer he moved away.  It was a relief that he was no longer in that neighborhood.</FONT></p>
