<P><FONT SIZE=2>As the power and ownership of business became more concentrated into fewer people the actual wages paid to entry level workers steadily declined.  Instead of hiring 
	people directly, many business started using more and more temporary workers, hired through temporary employment companies.  The main purpose of the temporary 
	employment companies were to manage the labor surplus.</FONT></p> 

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now after the layoff at the warehouse, Wheat Field found himself working for a temporary employment company.  He would be sent out to various business to work for 
	   a week or two.  Sometimes the job or assignment would only last a day.  The ones that lasted a day it was usually because someone at the business did not like the 
	   way he looked.  They would usually tell him at the end of the day not to return, however, many times they did not have the honor to tell him to his face.  Many 
	   times Wheat would return to his place and find a message on his answering machine, telling him the assignment is over.  He would call the temporary company about 
	   once a day asking if they had another assignment for him.  And so it went for him awhile.</FONT></p>









   <P><FONT SIZE=2>One day in February the temporary service sent him to a landfill.  He remained at the landfill as he saved money for the plans to build a robot dog and as he moved 
   forward with his political plans.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>He started to seek out others who had the same beliefs in liberty. Up until this point Wheat only knew of the two major political parties, Republican and Democrat. 
	The republicans recently won the majority in congress and most States for the first time in about 40 years.  Hence, for the first time in his life the democrats were 
	not the controlling party.</FONT></p>  

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>During the last few years that the democrats held power, the republicans would speak of freedom, liberty, reducing the size of government.  This was something that 
   appealed to the vast majority of the younger people, especially Wheat Field.
And it so happened that he joined the Republican party when he became old enough to register to vote.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>However, the only major thing that the republicans did once they became the majority party, was repeal the federal 55 mph speed-limit on interstate highways.  Most 
	people didn't notice any other reduction in federal regulations.  Many people were beginning to realize that if they were going to see an increase in liberty, 
	something else was needed.</FONT></p> 

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Now Wheat did not discuss politics, or much else when he first started working at the landfill.  His first duties there were walking around the place looking for 
	things out of the ordinary.  Sometimes he would be assigned various things to do.  Sometimes he got to go out with a trash truck to pick up garbage to bring back 
	to the landfill.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Who started this landfill?" Wheat asked one day as they were out on a garbage run.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"His name is Borace  Beindel," John answered, "Sometimes he can be seen waiting near his mailbox at the end of his driveway."</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"He waits for his mail everyday?"

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Not everyday, usually we only see him out waiting around the first week of the month"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Really?"

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The check he gets from the landfill lease is sent to him right after the 1st business day of the month."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Lease?" Wheat was puzzled, "You mean the land is not owned by the landfill company?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"About 60 percent of the actual land that we put the trash on is owned by the landfill company, the other 40 percent, we must lease from Mr Beindel."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Did Mr Beindel ever offer to sell the land to the company?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"No, in fact some of our best negotiators tried to get him to sell those acres," John said, "Beindel refuses to sell."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"That makes no sense at all," Wheat stated, "Why would anyone turn down the option to transfer the liability of owning land with massive amounts of waste?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Old man Beindel says that he doesn't want to give up those lease payments."</FONT></p>
 
<P><FONT SIZE=2>On this day they pulled up to a location with a large pile of stuff.  They loaded the stuff into the trash truck until only the piano was left.  Yes that's right, 
	 someone was actually throwing out a full size upright piano.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"This piano is going to be difficult to load into the back," Steve said.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Steve and Wheat were the 2 loaders who were doing most of the pick ups.  John was driving.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"All we need is a sledgehammer," Wheat said trying not laugh.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I got one in the truck," John was already opening up the side compartment that the sledgehammer.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat was disappointed to see John hand Steve the sledgehammer, because he was really looking forward to smashing a piano.  Perhaps some other day he will have the 
   opportunity to smash a piano.  Perhaps Steve will only smash it partially and let Wheat do some damage.</FONT></p> 

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Steve brought the sledgehammer down so forcefully that the piano exploded into pieces with his first hit.  Wheat would not share in the piano destruction that day.</FONT></p>

    

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Months passed, winter became spring, grass and weeds started to grow around the landfill.  Wheat would run a mower and other equipment as needed around the landfill.  
	 Sometimes his duties took him to houses that were on the border of the landfill itself.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>By the time Wheat started working at the landfill, it had expanded to the point where it was overtaking surrounding houses.  In years past the company that owned the 
	 landfill would buy up as much of the surrounding properties as possible.  Then they would simply expand the landfill onto those places.  This is why they now owned 
	 about 60 percent of the landfill property, with Borace Beindel's share down to 40 percent.  In the beginning Beindel's share was 100 percent. Throughout the years as 
	 the landfill bought out other surrounding farms, Beindel's share shrank as a percentage.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>On one fateful day Wheat and Steve were sent to an old farmhouse.  Their job was to clean it out, because the landfill was about to expand over that area.  The company 
	wanted to salvage anything of value that may be inside the building before it was demolished.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat explored the building he stumbled upon what appeared to be a concealed room.  It was not possible to access this room in the conventional way.  It was about a 
	half floor above the main level.  There were no stairs leading to it.  If it were not for his natural curiosity he would have shut the closet door and walked away after
	 making sure there was nothing of value inside.  But, there was something different about this closet.  This closet was higher than the other rooms of the main floor 
	 by about 2 feet.  Also on the inner most side were boards   
spaced about as far apart as a standard ladder.  The ladder ended about 2 and a half feet from the ceiling.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat looked around to make sure no one was looking as he shut the closet door behind him. The hidden panel was easy to open.  On the other side the floor was about 3 
	feet below, and there were stairs.</FONT></p>  

<P><FONT SIZE=2>It appeared to be some special office. In the center was a desk and a chair.  As he sat down in the chair Wheat Field looked around.  On one of the walls there was an 
	old painting of George Washington.  He was wearing what appeared to be a bib or apron.  On the apron was a design containing 3 main elements, a carpenter's square, an 
	architect's compass, and the capital letter G.  On another wall there was an old black & white picture.</FONT></p>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat carefully searched the drawers of the desk..  The desk itself was designed down to the minimum utility of what a desk was used for.  The top was a sanded smooth 
	oak finish.  There were 3 drawers on each side and a single thin wide drawer between them.  Beneath the center drawer was an open space for the user's legs and feet.  
	All sides of the desk were flat and at 90 degree angles.</FONT></p>


    <P><FONT SIZE=2>All of the drawers were empty, save two.  The center contained 2 pens, 1 pencil, 5 paperclips, 1 eraser, and a pair of glasses in a leather case.  In the bottom right 
	drawer was an old book.  Beneath the book there was a cigar box.  Wheat opened the book to find out it was printed in 1885.  The cigar box contained a key, a map, and 
	a piece of paper with a list of names.  One of those names was Borace Beindel.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat walked over to get a closer look at the old black & white picture on the wall.  The picture was of three men standing in the middle of a field.  Each of them had 
	a shovel.  All three shovels had wooden handles, and the metal digging part was rounded with a sharp point, for breaking ground.  Under the picture was a brass plaque, 
	with an inscription written thereon.</FONT></p>   

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"On this day February 2, 1962 ground was broken on a new landfill by Roger Natz, William Black, and Borace Beindel."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat put the book and cigar box in a bag as he vacated the room.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I thought you disappeared," Steve started speaking when he next saw Wheat.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I was busy cleaning out a closet."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat walked over to the truck and tossed the bag behind his seat.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What is in the bag?"</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Just an old book."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>It has been Wheat's experience that most people put little or no value on books.  He was sure he would be allowed to keep it, even if he had to show it to someone to 
   prove it was just a book.  Of course the cigar box was not mentioned.</FONT></p>
	

 
   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Later when Wheat was alone at his house he opened the cigar box to examine the map.  Perhaps this is a treasure map.  As he did this, he had the television on, tuned to 
   the national news.  The map itself appeared to be of the landfill.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><i>".........and other news it was 4 years ago today that Sam Walton, founder of Walmart died......."</i></FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>There were areas on the map that he remembered seeing as he worked at various places around the landfill.  He made plans to explore the areas on the map.  
	There could be a hidden treasure of some type.  He remember some of people who worked at the landfill for a few years tell him that they sometimes find cash, even 
	once found thousands of dollars in one day.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><i>"............is leading in the polls against Bob Dole.............Clinton should easily win reelection........."</i></FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>That night Wheat dreamed he was President of the united States of America and great mall in the center of Washington DC was turned into a landfill.</FONT></p>



      <P><FONT SIZE=2>On his days off from the landfill, Wheat would do work to advance his political plans.  Sometimes he would go to the local town meeting to learn about what really 
	  happens at a meeting.  Most times he would see the president or a vice president of the landfill company attending the meeting.  They would say hello to Wheat, and 
	  perhaps talk shop.</FONT></p> 
	  
<P><FONT SIZE=2>At the latest meeting, the town board was debating expansion plans for the landfill.  Now part of those plans included the construction of a waste to energy electric 
generator.  Everyone in the room knew that this meeting and debate were merely formalities.  Too much money was flowing into the right pockets to stop this train.</FONT></p>  

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>For some reason Wheat never saw Borace Beindel at a meeting, sometimes one of his lawyers would make an appearance, or even one of his family members, but never 
   Mr Beindel himself.  About the only time people saw him was the first week of the month when he waits for his check by his mailbox.  Even with all that money he still 
   chose to	live in his old farmhouse across the street from the landfill.</FONT></p>
   
   
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>On most spots on the old map, Wheat would find nothing of significance.  He was about to toss the map into the fireplace when he realized there was one place on the 
	map he never fully explored.  However, the reason he never explored that location happens to be because it is outside the boundaries of the landfill.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Across the street from the northern end of the landfill is an old school building.  This school building was the kind that are depicted in old paintings of 
	 schoolhouses from the 1870s.  It had the standard slanted peaked roof, with a chimney for a fireplace or wood-stove heater.</FONT></p>

     
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"John, I have a question," Wheat began, "Were you ever in that old schoolhouse?"</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Nope"

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Do you know of anyone who's been inside it?"</FONT></p>
    
<P><FONT SIZE=2>"I don't know of anyone going inside it since the landfill company tried to purchase the property about 5 years ago."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Who owns the schoolhouse?"</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The land and schoolhouse is owned by a trust.  This trust is overseen of a board of trustees and one of the trustees is Borace Beindel."</FONT></p>
