<center><h1>Chapter 8 Thug Bureaucrats</h1></center>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat approached the local government center.  It looked like mobile homes that were quickly dropped at the location and turned into offices.  As he walked in he saw the look of a 
   defeated people there waiting to grovel to bureaucrats.   Wheat waited for about an hour, then they called his number.  He walked up to where the bureaucrat was sitting and put his 
   birth certificate on the counter.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I was told this is what I need to bring with me, to get a government identification card."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>The bureaucrat looked like he may have been in his late 40s or 50s at the time.  His name was Larry.  He spent his early career as a thug wearing a costume pushing people around.   
	Later he transferred from the state police department to issuing government identification cards.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Most people were getting their government identification cards with pictures on them right after their 16th birthday.
Ever since Wheat was a small child he knew there was something wrong about government issued identification.  It was something he felt fundamentally in his gut.  
 As a child he would ask adults about this and other things.  They would respond with the philosophy of just the way it is.  Wheat was so repulsed by this that he did not get 
  government issued identification when he turned 16.  He would sometimes take his chances driving without a driver's license, however he never got caught.  
  Most times he would hitch rides or use a bus as transportation.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You are over nineteen years old and you never had a government, issued identification card," Larry boasted with a loud chuckle, trying to point out that Wheat was some type 
	 of nonconformist freak.  Of course the real reason for Larry's dig at Wheat was because he was able to avoid this first in a series of compromises with evil he would make.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat looked at Larry the government thug with disgust.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The fee is twenty five dollars," Larry said.</FONT></p>

	 
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat started to hand the cash over, Larry cut him off, "No, I don't except cash, check only."
The reason Larry did this is because he was almost certain that this 19 year old punk did not have a checkbook on his person.  Larry was very annoyed that standing before him was someone 
who purposely evaded the government identification database until he was 19, while most enter it at age 16 or sooner.  So, Larry decided to use his position of authority as a government 
bureaucrat to push this punk around and make a clown out of him.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Later Wheat returned with a check and got the government identification.  He made his first compromise with evil. This was not a simple thing to do. Wheat spent hours thinking about a 
   way to avoid this.  Almost all the older adults would not understand why government identification was a bad thing.  In fact he even heard some in his family when they found out say things 
   like, "it is about time," as if they were glad that Wheat reached a point where he could no longer resist the slave tag.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat remembered a group of people he was visit years ago when he was younger.  They refused to accept the slave tag, among other things. These people were called the Amish.  
   They spoke a strange language among themselves. He remembered the food at their place was so good. They were good to be friends with, however Wheat could never be Amish.  
   They were a bit too religious for him, and since his dream was to build a robotic dog, their apparently anti technology stand was a deal breaker in any case,  
   One thing was certain in his mind, it is much easier to avoid compromising with the evils of the world when you are a part of a family or group that is united in those beliefs.</FONT></p>  
	 
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>It was a relief, being able to drive any distance and not be concerned about getting  charged with driving without a license.  Wheat understood why people are universally willing to 
	compromise with evil.  There seemed to be some instinct to be a slave breed into most people.</FONT></p>


 <P><FONT SIZE=2>Later Wheat decided to go for a drive across the state border.  While he crossed state borders a few times as a child, it was always as a passenger.  
	This was the first time he drove across a state border.  There was a feeling of power, of controlling one's destiny that is unmatched by anything.  He only traveled about 10 miles 
	into the other state before turning around.  Upon entering his home state he saw a sign that there was a welcome center about 3 miles away.</FONT></p>  

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat felt great as he parked his car next to the welcome center.  Looking at the building, seeing the official sign, it gave him a feeling of respect.  
   He felt as if the state had built this official welcome center just for him, for the day he would arrive back in his home state.  The only thing the place needed was a sign out front 
   that said, "Welcome home Wheat Field."</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>There were various vending machines in the lobby.   Since he was thirsty he decided to go to the vending machine and get a drink.  After putting the money into the machine and pressing 
   the button with the picture of the brand of soda he wanted to drink, there was a noise emanating from the machine.  Wheat looked at the can of soda with puzzlement.  
   At the far end of the lobby, there was a curved counter.  The long curve was facing out toward the public area of the building.  There were bureaucrats sitting behind the inner curve 
   of the counter.  Wheat was going to speak with one of the people who were there to welcome him to the state.  Wheat walked across the lobby with the gait of a Prince, like this entire 
   building was built for him to enter it.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I would like to speak with you about something," Wheat began.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat was talking he noticed something familiar about that man sitting behind the counter.  First the man had a passive hostile attitude toward Wheat.  
	When Wheat was explaining about getting ripped off at the vending machine.  The man had a look of contempt on his face.  It was almost as if he liked the fact that 
	Wheat got ripped off at the building.  The man never smiled in his presence, however he had a combination of a look of satisfaction and disgust.  
	Disgust with the way the young punk walked up to the counter with dignity, and satisfaction in treating him like a clown.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>It was clear to him now.  The whole welcome center building was a lie.  Something else about the man at the counter who treated Wheat like a peace of shit was bothering Wheat.  
	About 5 miles down the road, he realized why.
That man shared the same basic look with the thug he got his government issued identification recently.  It was almost like they were brothers.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Hey, Wanda, did you see that young punk who was here earlier," Thug Frank asked.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Yeah, I noticed he didn't look very happy when he drove away."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I sure put that cocky young punk in his place.  I told him if he has a problem with the vending machine, he can go pound sand,"  At that point Thug Frank burst out into a loud hearty laugh.</FONT></p>
	
	
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat was so angry about being treated with such disrespect, he decided to do something about it.  These thugs were just regular people.  
	 If they have power to get into those bureaucrat positions, then there must be a way to fire them, or at least hold them accountable. There was an election next month, not only
	  was he going to vote, he may even launch a write in campaign.</FONT></p>
