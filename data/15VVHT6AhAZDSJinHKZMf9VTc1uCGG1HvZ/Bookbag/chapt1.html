<center><h1>Chapter 1: Dear Mr Principal</h1></center>
<br>

<P><FONT SIZE="2">Wheat Field was a teenage male of above average intelligence, had he conformed he would have been able to graduate from high school and enter college early.  
 However, Wheat Field was different.  As long as he could remember he had the feeling, actually it was much more than a feeling.  
 He knew at the core of his soul that there was something wrong with the world,  starting when he would hear his parents speak about not having enough money as a toddler. 
   He rejected and resisted this wrongness to the point where he was considered a rebel, a trouble maker, a bad kid.  He had been kicked out of his home school district. 
    Now he found himself in the third school district in three years.  He was shocked to learn the day he arrived that students were forbidden to 
	carry their books, pens, pencils, papers in bookbags between classes during school hours in the hallways.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>He was sitting in study-hall, writing a letter to the Principal of Western High school, asking why students are forbidden from carry their books in bookbags in the
	 hallways between classes, when another student whispered to him.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Hey Wheat," Nelson said, "what are you writing?"</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"A letter to the Principal about being able to carry bookbags in the hallways"</FONT></p>
      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Cool," Said Nelson, as he returned to his studies.</FONT></p> 

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat sat there for a few minutes thinking.  There he was all excited about this letter, and this other student just sort of shrugged it off.  
	  Something about that infuriated Wheat to the point that writing a letter was not enough now.</FONT></p>
      
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The chairs in study-hall were plastic spring loaded ones where the seat automatically flipped up when someone was  no longer sitting in them. 
	 As he stood up, throughout the hall a squeaking sound could be heard as the crap chair he was sitting in sprung back.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat Field started walking to the Principal's office to speak with him about how things are at Western High School.  
	  He was very annoyed when upon standing up from his seat in study-hall, the seat made a loud squeaking noise. 
	  Walking out of the study-hall he began his journey to the main office of Western High School.  It was a long and fateful journey.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>As he was walking down the hall he decided to enter the restroom, to use the toilet, as he always did before he was going to confront someone or do something he
	  thought was important.  After he flushed the urinal, suddenly all the urinals in the restroom started flushing simultaneously.  
	  At the same time a hole started opening up in the floor of the restroom. Stairs appeared.  So, he started walking down the stairs, and noticed the floor resealing 
	  above him.</FONT></p>  
	  
	  
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>There was a hallway.  It appeared to be of much older construction than the school above it.  Along the old stone walls were what appeared to be cast iron rings about
	  every 10 feet along the hallway.  In those rings were lamps with lit flames burning some type of oil.  Music was playing that he had never before heard in his life. 
	   It was the most beautiful music he ever heard.  It was not until he reached the end that he really took notice as to how perfectly polished the black granite floor 
	   was.</FONT></p>
 
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>At the end of the hallway was a solid oak door.  Carved on it were symbols of books, above that was the words "Order of the Bookbag".  
	Standing there in awe he suddenly heard the sound of hinges creaking as the door slowly opened.  To his amazement, there was another hallway behind the door.  
	This hallway was about twice as long as the first one.  Along the walls were old paintings of students who have been dead for many years.  
	At the end of the hall there was a second doorway.  On one side of the doorway was what appeared to be an original copy of the declaration of independence of the united States of America.  
	On the other side was the Constitution of the united States of America.  Both were sealed in glass cases.</FONT></p>

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>Beyond the doorway was a large room with shelves of books along three of the four walls.  The wall at the far end had a bar complete with adjustable bar-stools.  
	   At the side of the bar was a standard size door.</FONT></p> 

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Field," said, a voice from behind the bar, "Samantha, is waiting for you in her office."</FONT></p>
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   <P><FONT SIZE=2>Samantha was Wheat Field's sponsor, and today was the fateful day to be initiated as a member of Order of the Bookbag.   
	   Samantha and Wheat became acquainted soon after he started to attend Western High.  
	   Eventually they would share a passionate kiss, however that was the only kiss they ever shared and as far as they took their physical relationship. 
	   They would each remember that kiss, the rest of their lives, even after having sexual relationships with others.</FONT></P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Her office had book shelves along one of the walls.  Along another wall was a glass case.</FONT></p>

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Have a seat Wheat," she said as she pointed at the chair on the side of the desk opposite hers.</FONT></p>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>After sitting down she asked if he was absolutely sure about going through with the initiation. She called another member to perform the actual initiation.
 
       <P><FONT SIZE=2>There are rumors, then there are rumors of rumors.   Years ago a physics professor named Dr John Geiklan disappeared.  Some say, he is dead. 
	    There were rumors that he left the USA and became a citizen of another nation.  There were even rumors that he was part of a terrorist organization.  
		It did not surprise Wheat when he walked through the door.</FONT></p>

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>Samantha put her hand on what appeared to be a simple paperweight on her desk.  Presently, a concealed door about one foot square opened and a tray slid out 
	   from the wall.  On the tray was a small assortment of cigarettes, a few cigars, and three glasses with drinks, complete with ice cubes.  
	   Dr Geiklan lit one of the cigars and slowly took a few puffs from his cigar before he picked up his drink and sat down in his chair.  
	   Then Samantha stood up, walked over to the tray, picked up a cigarette and her drink, sitting back down at her desk.  
	   She lit her cigarette, took a healthy lung full of smoke and then took a sip of her drink, before she exhaled.   
	   Wheat walked over picked up his glass and sat back down.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>It was the glass of Dr Pepper from which all other Dr Peppers would be measured and found wanting.  
		He was sitting there savoring the flavor when Dr Geiklan spoke for the first time since walking in the room.</FONT></p>
		
		
		 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Field," he began, "we have been watching you for years."
"It has been determined by many who are learned in the study of psychology and personality, that you have a natural inborn resistance to negative propaganda, 
affecting the mind.   Do you have any questions before we begin?"</FONT></p>

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Can members of Order of the Bookbag carry bookbags in the hallways between classes?" Wheat began, "How long until the bookbag ban is lifted?"</FONT></p>
 
       <P><FONT SIZE=2>"If students of Western High are ever freely allowed to carry bookbags in the hallways, it will be many years  in the future," he stated with the seriousness of 
	   a general, "Mr Field, you will never carry a bookbag as a student in high school again."</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Then what purpose does Order of the Bookbag serve?" Wheat responded.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The real reason students are forbidden from carrying bookbags in the hallways is to prepare them to live in a totalitarian police state."  Dr Geiklan began.</FONT></p>	  
	  
<P><FONT SIZE=2>"As you already know, I have a PhD in physics and mathematics.  I also look for patterns in history, the behavior of populations, sociology etc.  
It took me a few years of watching the trends to see the pattern emerge.  When I realized what was happening, I resigned as professor of physics the following morning."</FONT></p> 


      <P><FONT SIZE=2>While Dr Geiklan was speaking, Samantha was slowing puffing on a cigarette and sipping her drink.</FONT></p> 
	  
	   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Did you notice that the state is preparing to pass a law raising the legal age to purchase tobacco from 16 to 18?" Dr Geiklan continued,  
	   "I remember when the first law was passed requiring people to be 16 to legally purchase tobacco products."</FONT></p>
      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Haven't you ever wondered why the legal restrictions are always getting more restricted over time?"</FONT></p>  
      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Why does the law never become less restricted?"  "What do you think is more likely to happen in the future, the legal age to consume alcoholic beverages lowered 
	  from 21 to 18, or the legal age to purchase and smoke a cigarette raised from 18 to 21?"  Dr Geiklan continued, "Those are rhetorical questions, everyone 
	  in this room already knows the answer."</FONT></p>
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You regularly ready the news paper,"  He went on to drive the point home, "I'm sure you saw the story where the IRS accidentally overcharged someone."</FONT></p>  
	
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Did you ever see a story in the news about the IRS accidentally undercharging someone for taxes?"</FONT></p>
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Of course you didn't," Dr Geiklan answered his own question before Wheat could.</FONT></p>
     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"If these things were accidents, then there would be some accidents in favor of the taxpayer."</FONT></p>
		
		
	 <P><FONT SIZE=2>Dr Geiklan continued talking for many minutes.  Every sentence hit Wheat Field's consciousness almost like a physical blow.  
	 Many of the questions and ideas Dr Geiklan spoke about were thoughts that Wheat had but never shared before with anyone.  
	 As Dr Geiklan was speaking thoughts were exploding in Wheat's mind, thoughts like:</FONT></p>
											  <br />
        <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>Of Course!  I always knew that in my heart!</i></FONT></p>
												 <br />
       <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>Yes, it is true.</i></FONT></p>
												  <br />
      <P><FONT SIZE=2><i>I thought I was the only one who saw these things.</i></FONT></p>
										   <br />
    <P><FONT SIZE=2>".......and then I saw the undeniable truth and my knees buckled," Dr Geiklan now speaking barely above a whisper,  
"I had to put my hands on my desk to steady myself as I was standing there."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What truth?" Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"The government of the united States of America, along with every major government of the world has been infiltrated and taken over by people who worship the devil," 
	   he continued,  "Their plan is to use the authority of the state and national governments around the world to enslave the human race."
"The ultimate goal of the demons possessing them, is the total annihilation and extinction of the human race, and if they can pull it off, the eventual 
extinction of all life on Earth."</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Order of the Bookbag was created to oppose them?"  Wheat asked.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"There are many organizations some more recently created, and some much older," Samantha spoke for the first time since Dr Geiklan arrived.  
	  "One of the main purposes that Order of the Bookbag was created for is to preserve knowledge, and real education.  
	  The purpose of schools today is to destroy the minds of the students and young people.  Our mission is to spread the knowledge of this threat to the future 
	  of the human race to students that are ready to receive the message. It is also to inspire real learning."
     "You see, Wheat," she continued, "people especially young people have an innate curiosity about the world and how things work.  
	 People have a natural drive to learn new things.  These government schools purpose is to make learning and education as painful as possible 
	 for young students, so they will turn against their own nature."
"A person who has been trained to shut their own mind down is more easily controlled and enslaved."</FONT></p>	  


 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Most people will never have an original thought in their life," Dr Geiklan, interjected.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>The sad truth of the last statement hit Wheat so hard, he closed his eyes for a few seconds barely being able to hold back his emotion.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>They sat there and spoke until early afternoon.  As he was sitting there Wheat knew that he was going to be dropping out of school before the spring.</FONT></p> 

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"After you leave this room we may not ever meet again," Dr Geiklan said, "Spend these next years learning, and exploring.  
	  Find a way to travel to different areas 
	  of the USA and even other countries if you can.  While you are doing this, keep your eyes and ears open.  However, know that silence is your friend."</FONT></p>


       <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat walked out of the room, he was now a member of Order of the Bookbag.  He was only 16 years old, same age as Samantha.  
	   He saw her a few times before he dropped out of high school a few months later.  After that he would never see her again, and sadly it would take many years 
	   until he realized just how rare a lady of intelligence and wisdom is, especially with beauty.
       A few days later it was time for Wheat Field's lunch period at the high school. There was a library across the hall from the cafeteria. 
	    He decided to use his lunch time to study and do some research at the library.  This was the first and last time he would enter the school library.</FONT></p> 
		
		
		<P><FONT SIZE=2>The library of Western High school was at the top of a winding set of stairs.  It was about the size of an average high school library.  
		A few feet from the door their was a counter with a librarian sitting behind doing things that librarians do. 
		 There were some tables and chairs right next to the counter.  While the library itself seemed to have the standard layout like the ones in his other school, 
		 Wheat noticed two differences.  There were no other students in there studying or readying.  
		 And the tables he saw were pushed up much closer to the librarian's counter.</FONT></p>  

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat spent some time at the bookshelves looking for a book to read.  There was two small desks with chairs near the end of one of the bookshelves at the
	   far end of the library.  Wheat sat down and started to read his book.</FONT></p> 

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"What are you doing back there?"  The librarian-cop was speaking loudly, just below a shout.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Reading a book," Wheat replied after recovering from the shock of a librarian talking to him in a hateful tone of voice in a library.</FONT></p>   

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"COME HERE," the librarian-Nazi said, louder still, almost shouting.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Now, Wheat stands up and walks out toward the librarian counter.  At this point he is confused and is trying not to let total shock show on his face.</FONT></p>

       <P><FONT SIZE=2>"If you want to read a book," she said, "you must sit down there." As she was making the statement she was pointing at one of the tables pushed up next 
	   to her counter.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Then why are desks and chairs over there," Wheat point back where he was, "where I was sitting reading a book?"</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You must sit there so I can watch you," she snarled with a face filled with such hate, that she looked like the 
	  Emperor trying to kill Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat immediately walked out of the library.  It was clear now, why there were no students studying at the library.
The other students of the school must find it just as difficult to study sitting next to a hate filled demon.  That is why they avoided the library.</FONT></p>
