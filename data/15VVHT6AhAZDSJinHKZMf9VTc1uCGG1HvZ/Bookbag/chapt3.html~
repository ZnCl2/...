<P><FONT SIZE=2>Years later Jim's body was burnt out from steroids among other things. The nurses would check Jim's body weight every Thursday morning.  
	   On the last Thursday of his life he was down to 72 pounds. His rib bones had multiple titanium plates and pins holding them together, because they started fracturing in the
	    previous five months. On Thursday night he lay in the bed struggling to take each breath.  Then as he was down to the last few breaths his sternum started to crack. 
		Finally as he took his last breath, he fought so hard to take another, even after his sternum was shattered that the increase in blood pressure caused his weaken skull to fracture. 
		The last thing he felt was his belly button touching his spine.</FONT></p>
