<P><FONT SIZE=2>At the time Wheat just continued to work and learn at the furniture factory.  He saved as much of his pay as he could.  Then one day while he was working he heard some angry shouting 
	   from Bill's department.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>After about a minute, Fred walked over and told Wheat to go work in Bill's department.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"They need another person on the Long rip"</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat nodded his head and walked down to the Long rip machine.  Of course he was told to work at the receiving end and stack to lumber after it rolled off the conveyor belt.  
	 Stacking the lumber rolling off the Long rip was the hardest job in the factory.  At the other end of the machine was Tiffany, Steven, and George.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>".....yeah, Wheat was the only one in Fred's department who could help us with the Long rip,"  George was saying.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I just get tired of seeing that young punk," Tiffany said in contempt for Wheat, "He had better keep up with us."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"We are already 20 minutes behind because that other guy just walked out," Steven added, "We are going to have to really push it, if we are going to make any bonus off 
	of this order."</FONT></p>


     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat started stacking the first boards as they rolled off the conveyor belt.  He was working harder then ever.  You see, the machine was so big that boards would roll out of the cutting 
	 part then roll down the conveyor and hit a pressure activated sensor.  The conveyor was divided into 2 stages.  When the sensor tripped the first conveyor would stop and the boards would 
	 be moved to a second conveyor.  As they rolled down the second belt, Wheat would grab the boards and stack them in carts.  Today they were cutting the boards at close to the maximum length 
	 the machine was capable of cutting.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>As Wheat was stacking the first few boards he knew immediately that something was wrong.  He had just enough time to duck behind the cart before the boards exploding were flying in 
	 pieces over his head.  The boards were flying out the machine faster than ever.  As he was stacking the boards he kept on eye on the conveyor belts.  
	 They were force feeding the machine pushing boards out before the sensor could activate and transfer the previous set to the second belt.  This had the effect of causing a massive jam 
	 and there was nothing Wheat could do to stop it.  The only thing he could do was keep in eye on the belts and be ready to duck.</FONT></p>
	  

 <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Look at that shit," Tiffany said, "It is jamming up because Wheat isn't doing his job."</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>George walked over and helped Wheat clear the jam of lumber.  After clearing the lumber, they restarted the Long rip.  They rammed harder than before. It immediate started 
	  to crash again. 
	   Wheat had to duck twice before he went to see the supervisor.</FONT></p>  

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Steven jogged around toward where Wheat was working.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Hey!" Steven yelled with an angry look on his face, "Where are you going?"</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Going to speak with the supervisor," Wheat then pointed at the Long rip, "that machine is not being ran correctly."</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat tried to explain to Bill how they were running the  machine unsafe.  Bill did not care and told him to get back to work.  Wheat knew his life was in danger, so went 
	  went looking 
	  for Bill's boss.  The next person he found was Mr Smith.</FONT></p>  

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Mr Smith, there is something seriously wrong.  I would be putting my life in danger by continuing to run that machine.  I am not lazy and willing to work hard.  
	  Bill didn't want to listen to me about how dangerous it is."</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Mr Smith looked at Wheat, "Life's a risk, if you want a job here, you need to go back to work right now."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Looks like I am going to be quitting," Wheat said to Mr Smith as Bill was now standing there beside him.</FONT></p>

      <P><FONT SIZE=2>Bill looked at Mr Smith.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You won't be hiring him back again?" Bill pleaded to Mr Smith.  It was clear by the tone of his voice he didn't want Wheat working there. In spite of the fact that Wheat was the only 
	one capable of doing the job after running the last guy out.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"No, he won't be back."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat walked out of the factory after picking up his last paycheck.  Better to walk away in one piece than to be hauled away in pieces.  He was so sure someone was eventually going 
	 to get seriously injured, he was waiting to hear about it in the news.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>It was almost two years when the lead story on the news was about someone dying in a brutal accident in a woodworking factory.  
	However, it was not the furniture factory that Wheat worked at.</FONT></p>
