<center><h1>Chapter 10 Unemployment Office</h1></center>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>As the 2nd week of December approached some of the old timers in the warehouse started talking about when the work slowdown and layoffs would begin.  It was said 
	that the bottom drops out about the 2nd or 3rd week of December.  Some pondered what they may do while collecting unemployment for a few months.  It was said that 
	they usually started calling people back to work around March or April.</FONT></p>  

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>About the end of the 2nd week of December things did start to slowdown.  The beginning of the 3rd week there was a meeting.  The majority of the people who worked 
	there received their last paycheck and were told they could go apply for unemployment benefits.  Wheat and a few others he worked with were specifically told they 
	would be called back in the spring, because they were hard workers.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat went to the unemployment office for the first time in his life.  He saw a room full of people sitting in chairs waiting to apply for unemployment benefits.  
	There was a sign that directed people to a stack of applications.  Wheat had to stand along the back wall so he could fill out his application.  There were a few 
	open chairs, unfortunately however, there were no desks or tables for the people to use. This left a shelf along the back wall.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Since this was the first time Wheat entered an unemployment office, he had some confusion about how to fill out the paperwork.  Hence he was stuck in the paradox 
	 of not being able to finish the paperwork until he could ask one of the bureaucrats, who are going to be expecting him to have the paperwork completed.  
	 After waiting a few hours and seeing that no one was being helped by the bureaucrats, he walked out and looked for a job.  At that time in history, it was easier to 
	 find another job, than to go through the hassle of applying for unemployment.</FONT></p>
