 <P><FONT SIZE=2>The summer Wheat turned 19 he got his first warehouse job.</FONT></p> 

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I hope you like hard work," Ethane told him at the beginning of his first day.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat endured the hot summer months working in the warehouse.  He moved and sorted boxes on conveyor belts.  It was also the first place he worked at where he was allowed to be trained 
	to operate moving equipment.  These were various battery operated devices used to move pallets of products around.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Throughout the warehouse were loudspeakers.  The speakers could be used to page individuals and make announcements.  All other times they were used to pipe music to the warehouse. 
	Now, different people have different tastes in music.  One thing Wheat noticed is the radio station that was playing rarely ever changed.  
	Most of the songs that particular radio station played could make a deaf man cry.  Sometimes there was a reprieve, a day or two when there was a different radio station's music pouring 
	out of the loudspeakers is the warehouse. Usually on those days it would be a county music station.  What really bothered Wheat most was listening to the same songs over again many times 
	during the day everyday.  It made no sense to him.  There were many people with songs that could not get their music on the broadcast airwaves.  
	Why were these radio stations only playing the same 10 to 20 songs in a day?</FONT></p> 

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Tomas, I have a question," Wheat was saying during break time.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Tomas looked over at Wheat.  Before he replied, Wheat started to ask his question.</FONT></p>  

    <p><FONT SIZE=2>"Do you think it would be a good thing if there was a better variety of music playing?"</FONT></p>

    <p><FONT SIZE=2>"Yeah, that would be cool," Tomas replied, "They should change the radio station everyday.  There is more than one person working in this warehouse."</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat decided he was going to ask about the "radio station policy".   His boss told him that one of the up on high managers or executives decides what is happening with the 
	radio.  
	When Wheat asked about changing the radio station, he ran into the philosophy of <i>just the way it is</i>.</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The philosophy of <i>just the way it is</i>, is a philosophy of the powerless and the weak willed.  It is the foundation of all tyranny and slavery.  
	 As anyone with a mind of their own knows that slavery and tyranny are two sides of the same coin.  Most are indoctrinated into <i>just the way it is</i>, from the time they are young children.  
	 This mind programming is massively accelerated during the childâ€™s growth as a student in the government controlled schools.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Being confronted with the boss's <i>just the way it is</i>, motivated Wheat to do something about this radio station annoyance.   
	 Everyday he would ask everyone he could about their opinion of the radio station situation.  Almost everyone agreed with Wheat about it.</FONT></p> 
	 
	 
	  <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Boss, someone is trying to start trouble at the warehouse," the stool pigeon was saying. Stool Pigeon was someone who barely squeaked by on any job.  
	  She was not the best looking woman in the world, however there was enough weak minded men around to carry her bags through life as she collected the same pay.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Who is it and what trouble are they into?" The Boss asked.</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>"The new guy, Wheat Field, he is going around getting people stirred up about the music and radio station," As she was speaking she pouted her lips and made sad puppy eyes at him to 
	activate his white knight programming, "can you do something about this."</FONT></p>  

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The fact that the Boss knew that Wheat was a good hard worker in the warehouse was the only thing that moderated his white knight programming.  He gave Wheat a warning about his 
	 activities regarding the music.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Of course Wheat was not a fool. He stopped speaking with most people about the radio. He was puzzled about how asking people about the radio was such a problem, it would cause 
	the boss to give him a warning.</FONT></p>	
	
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=2>One day a manager walked over to Wheat to ask him about his slave card.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>"Wheat," the manager was saying with authority, "we don't have a copy of your government issued identification."</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>Wheat looked at the manager puzzled.  He never need government issued identification to work, before.</FONT></p>

   <P><FONT SIZE=2>"You need to bring your government issued identification by the end of the week, or you will not be able to continue  here as an employee."</FONT></p>
