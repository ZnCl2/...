<P><FONT SIZE=2>Roger was a faithful loyal blue color man getting paid an hourly wage to shape wood. He worked for years at the factory.  One day he noticed something wrong with the saw he was using to 
	cut the boards.  The blade was getting dull and it was getting loose.</FONT></p> 

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>"I have a bad feeling about that saw," Roger told his wife, "I told the boss, but he just ignored me and told me to get back to work."</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>Money was tight in Roger's family, and he just started working overtime to try a put money aside for his son's college education.  He did not want his son to struggle as a wage slave 
	 for a meager pay.  He was going to start looking for another job, but he couldn't afford to quit.</FONT></p>

    <P><FONT SIZE=2>A few days later the shaft in the middle of the blade split.  At first a small piece of the blade flew off and entered his right cheekbone at an angle.  The force of the impact hitting at 
	the right spot caused his eye to pop out and was hanging by tissue on his cheek.  Blood was squirting out the side of his face.  Roger started yelling in pain for help.
Unfortunately the saw was still running at full power while Roger was in shock of what just happened.  Then 2 seconds later the rest of the blade flew out at full force as the shaft broke 
completely off. The blade entered exactly between his lips as he was yelling. It instantly decapitated him from the mouth up.  People were  puking as they looked over and saw his body standing 
there ending with a neck and mouth.  Besides blood, there was the perfect sound of a train whistle as the air was leaving his lungs.</FONT></p>

     <P><FONT SIZE=2>The place where Roger died was a casket factory.  His son's college was paid for.</FONT></p>
