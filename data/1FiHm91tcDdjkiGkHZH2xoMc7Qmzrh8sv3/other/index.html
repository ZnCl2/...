    <p>a place for the (yet) unalbumed tracks by <a href="/1MCoA8rQHhwu4LY2t2aabqcGSRqrL8uf2X/">[caryoscelus]</a>. CC-BY-SA</p>
    <p>note that some of tracks have been released along with mvs on
    a <a href="/1N8zibqog72CCDBDo8jrxU7C6Q8JeVND2Z/">separate site</a> and are
      not duplicated here</p>
    <p><b>notes on some tracks</b></p>
    <p>"sonic collage" is made of sound recordings made by various contributors (proper credits will be available after i negotiate how to attribute them..)</p>
    <p>"tryad meets complex numbers" is of course a mix of tracks by those projects, all covered by CC-BY-SA license</p>
    <p>"slow untitled" is based on a track by Fadiese</p>
    <p>"eyes glow through static" is based on a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/suedwestlicht/augenleuchten">track by SÃ¼dwestlicht</a></p>
    <p>"microt" is based on track by <a href="https://dolorescatherino.bandcamp.com/">Catherino Dolores</a></p>
    <p>if you want flac (lossless quality audio), it should be available upon request</p>
    <p>you can listen from this page, get the files from data/ directory (after loading) or perhaps even add this site's directory to your music player collection</p>
