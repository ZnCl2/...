unfunny jokes' king

the bear walks into the bar
and asks "where is my car"

the barman starts to mix the drink
but bear is too big

the barman asks to pay the price
the bear hugs him twice

the bear walks into the night
oh isn't it delight

i've got the whistles and the beeps
but i can't sing
i wanna wanna wanna be
unfunny jokes' king
