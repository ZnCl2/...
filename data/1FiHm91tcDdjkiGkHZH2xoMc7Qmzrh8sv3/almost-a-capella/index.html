    <p>[that kind of noise] - [almost a capella], 8th album by <a href="/1MCoA8rQHhwu4LY2t2aabqcGSRqrL8uf2X/">[caryoscelus]</a>. CC-BY-SA</p>
    <p>a sonic exploration of no subject in particular. originally intended as a challenge to make an album in less than a day, but i couldn't keep myself concentrated on it, so it took somewhat longer. not a particulary pleasant listen. note that tracks were split post-hoc and a bit arbitrary. it is "intended" to listen the whole album through</p>
    <p>if you want flac (lossless quality audio), it should be available upon request</p>
    <p>you can listen from this page, get the files from data/ directory (after loading) or perhaps even add this site's directory to your music player collection</p>
