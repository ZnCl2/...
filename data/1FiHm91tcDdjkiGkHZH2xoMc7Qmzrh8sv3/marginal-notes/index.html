    <p>[that kind of noise] - [marginal notes], 19th album by <a href="/1MCoA8rQHhwu4LY2t2aabqcGSRqrL8uf2X/">[caryoscelus]</a>. CC-BY-SA</p>
    <p>a compilation of some of my noisy work during 2019-2021 . most of the tracks are either have been published individually before or simply don't belong anywhere in a bigger picture . still , i tried to make the listen through a coherent and enjoyable experience . there are a few musical videos for these tracks:</p>

    <p><a>[notes]</a></p>
    <p>001 - winter mornings can be depressing with all that air pollution coming down to earth and never ever clearing up</p>
    <p>002 - the fortuna leaves a bored count as he goes mad</p>
    <p>003 - a few cigarettes are being smoked in the middle of the night . raw tobacco experience</p>
    <p>004 - soothing drilling recorded in a bright moment of my life</p>
    <p>005 - march was around the corner and the surviving plan was to feed on nothing but grains</p>
    <p>006 - a light electronic track featuring stray dogs for vocals</p>
    <p>007 - a limited noise collbaration . a music track out of sounds sent by other people <a>https://linuxmusicians.com/viewtopic.php?t=20124</a></p>
    <p>008 - noise of printers , beat of badly installed vents and did somebody bring distortion pedal? - i enjoy the noises of my imaginary office</p>
    <p>009 - a movement , or being stale , or just flashes of randomness shining on potential listener</p>
    <p>010 - the grand noise machine no one knows how it works or how to operate , but it does resemble a good old organ a little bit</p>
