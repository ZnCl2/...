For full use there are barriers:\n\n- No good web gates\n- There is a mass of unknown content on my computer that I donâ€™t control (more than 3GB already)\n- Technically, this is just a blog. No file sharing, video, audio, etc.\n- There is no way to find out where and how my own content is stored safely.\n- Finally, there is a rather strange audience. This, of course, is a subjective assessment, but I'm not interested in them :)\n\nSo I prefer ZeroNet :)",
