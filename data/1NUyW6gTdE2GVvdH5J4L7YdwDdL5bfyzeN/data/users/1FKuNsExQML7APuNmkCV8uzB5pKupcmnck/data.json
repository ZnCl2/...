Maybe they just write it, but they are not doing any measures.\n\nYeah I will definitely have to look into it. I mean the tethering works great, but I sure wish I had a hardline connection",

Worked well for the most part :p\n\nThat's awesome LOL. I don't have a neighbor that has hardline connection or I might try that. I live in the country. ZeroNet, Tor, and Beaker Browser for the DAT network works great using that means, but I2P not so much. ",

Yeah it was verrrryyy low budget lol. I used gelatin to make a fake hand that gets chopped off and smashed in a gate. Regular old Knox Gelatin lol",

But I'm all for free speech. I wouldn't classify this as hate speech. They use rude language, but don't call for anything nasty. Whoever wants to watch this should be able to.\n\nYeah he's a bit of a nutter sometimes, but there's no reason i can see to ban him",

I would be balling out my MEP if I were in the EU. Most of those fuckers didn't even read what they signed and were happy about the outcome. Pitiful",

For full use there are barriers:\n> \n> No good web gates\n> There is a mass of unknown content on my computer that I donâ€™t control (more than 3GB already)\n> Technically, this is just a blog. No file sharing, video, audio, etc.\n> There is no way to find out where and how my own content is stored safely.\n> Finally, there is a rather strange audience. This, of course, is a subjective assessment, but I'm not interested in them :)\n> \n> So I prefer ZeroNet :)\n\nI just thought it was neat. I geek out over pretty much any new decentralized thing I find. I usually share them for people who may not have seen them. I haven't fully explored it and from your description it sounds rather boring LOL\n\nI do like ZeroNet though and it's amazing what they're doing here. Thanks for reading and commenting :)",
