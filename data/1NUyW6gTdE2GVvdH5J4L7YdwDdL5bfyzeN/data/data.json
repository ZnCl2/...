The originator of the game, Hanley Speiser, has left the game due to a total server crash causing the loss of the entire game.\n\nThis all started when a new dev was brought on to help with the code. The other two devs had either left the game or had so many real life issues that they coudln't dedicate time. The new dev came off as haughty in the beginning and rather rude in group chat.\n\nThings just started going downhill. This past weekend the entire system went down while he was doing updates and now... the story is that the server got wiped because of a malicious attack. I ain't buying it for one. I call bullshit. There are many things that make me think this. \n\nAnyway, I invested $178 to get the scripts for this game to make my mesh items do things like help the player's stats. We already made $700 since we started. I got my money back, but I lost a game I loved. Even if they do bring it back; there are things they've done to ruin trust in them.\n"

Only sign in using the TRX wallet. It is also centralized as in this site probably sits on only one centrally controlled server. but, you know what screw it lol.

It's simple to do, it tastes good, and it'll get ya fucked up if you do it right!\n\nWhat you will need to make this:\n\n1 gallon apple juice\n1 cup raisins (optional)\n1 cup of sugar\n1 packet of Fleischman's yeast (Any yeast will do really)\n1 large pot\n1 Empty gallon bottle\n1 thermometer\n1 siphon hose\n1 large balloon\n\nTake your large pot and pour your gallon of juice into the pot. Begin heating your apple juice on medium heat. Add your cup of sugar. This process will kill any wild yeast and bacteria in the apple juice and incorporate the sugar into the juice. Let this cook for 10 minutes.\n\nAfter the 10 minute period elapses pull your apple juice off of the heat and set to the side. Keep checking the apple juice with the thermometer until it reaches around 96 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhen the temperature reaches the desired coolness pour in your packet of yeast and stir in gently.  \n\nAfter stirring the yeast and letting it cool a bit more, pour the mixture back into the original bottle that the apple juice came in. Then stretch the balloon over the mouth of the bottle and set the bottle in a warm, dark place to sit.\n\nThis will take a few days or up to a week, but you will see the balloon inflate. Once the balloon inflates and then deflates your hooch is ready. At this point it is not ready to drink though. We'll need to siphon the juice out and leave the yeast behind.\n\nBe careful not to agitate the bottle very much as you don't want the settled yeast to incorporate back into the juice. Take your siphon house and stick it into the bottle just above the yeast line and then begin siphoning the juice into another bottle/container.\n\nNow your hooch is completely finished!\n\nYou can make 2-1 Gallon batches of this and then when they are both finished you can put 1 gallon in the freezer for a few hours. Everything in that gallon will freeze but the alcohol. You can then take the pure alcohol from that gallon and pour it into the other gallon of hooch to boost its alcohol content.\n\nEnjoy folks! :) "

			"title": "Make your own charcoal",
			"date_published": 1527942434.363,
			"body": "I got the below instructions from an online survival guide and thought I'd share it with all of you ZeroNetters. You never know when this will come in handy. You can find the original instructions on the clearnet with pictures here - [Make your own charcoal](https://urbansurvivalsite.com/9-easy-steps-make-charcoal/)\n##Make your own charcoal\n\nOne of the simplest and most popular ways to cook without power is with a charcoal grill. But what if you run out of charcoal? If youâ€™re living through a long-term disaster, you canâ€™t just run to the store for more. Instead, youâ€™ll need to make your own. Fortunately, charcoal is not that difficult to make. But before you make charcoal, you have to understand what it is.\n\nSimply put, charcoal is wood that has had all the volatile compounds burned out, leaving carbon. Carbonizing wood requires fire and the ability to cut air off from that fire. That way the fire goes out after consuming the volatile compounds, but without completely consuming the wood. When the fire is gone, you are left with charcoal.\n\nTraditionally charcoal was made in one of three ways. In a pit where the fire was gradually built up and then carefully smothered. The second way was in a clamp or pile, where the pile was built in such a way that it gradually smothered as it burned. The third way is in a kiln, where the charcoal wood was put in a separate container, surrounded by fire, and the volatile gases were directed into the outer fire to improve the burn.\n\n**Tools Needed to Make Your Own Charcoal**\n\nâ€¢ Rake â€“ A heavy duty garden rake with a metal head.\nâ€¢ Shovel â€“ Standard, pointy metal shovel. A square metal snow shovel may also be useful.\nâ€¢ Matches and other material for starting the fire.\nâ€¢ Clear ground, free of underground roots.\nâ€¢ A non-flammable and non-melting piece of material to be used as a lid. I recommend a garbage can lid, or a square piece of metal roofing.\nâ€¢ Wood â€“ While you can use cord-fire wood, I used scrounged wood like branches, stumps, and other miscellaneous wood. If you want charcoal that will be a certain size for your grill or smoker, you can smash it up later.\nâ€¢ Garden hose â€“ Since you are working with fire, keep a water supply nearby and handy to put out any stray sparks (or cool a burn).\n\n**Making your Own Charcoal**\n\n**Step 1** â€“ Choose a clear site with no stray roots nearby.\n\n**Step 2** â€“ Dig a pit, approximately 3 feet deep and just large enough for your non-burnable lid to fully cover. I took my lid from a bottom-less garbage can, and used the can as an extra insert in my pit. Using a can, however, is optional.\n\n**Step 3** â€“ Prepare your wood. Cut any long branches or tree trunks into lengths that will fit inside your pit. Make sure you have collected more than enough wood to fill your pit. 1/3rd of the wood will be needed just to get the heat high enough for the smolder to work.\n\n**Step 4** â€“ Start your fire in the bottom of the pit. You want this fire to be quite hot. If you start a fire on the edge of the pit, you can get a good supply of coals going and then dump them into your pit. Tend your fire and build up a 2 inch layer of coals on the bottom of the pit. You need a very high combustion temperature in the pit, as otherwise it wonâ€™t pull enough air in to adequately combust all material.\n\n**Step 5** â€“ Once there is a bed of coals, add in your to-be-charcoaled wood. As soon as this wood is well caught, put your lid on the pit. Use your rake and shovel to position the lid. You want limited air flow for 3-6 hours, depending on how dry the wood is. Air flow should be mostly off-gassing, and a low smoulder. It should smell like creosote.\n\n**Step 6** â€“ After the smoulder has maintained for 4-6 hours, there should be barely any smoke rising. At this point, you can either cut off all air, or just wait for 24-48 hours. This wait period lets your charcoal cool, gets rid of live coals, and prevents spontaneous combustion when you open the pit.\n\n**Step 7** â€“ Remove the soil from the lid (if you sealed it), and remove the lid. The wood will have reduced by half, and up to three quarters depending on the variety. Scoop out your charcoal, and start a second batch if youâ€™d like.\n\n**Step 8** â€“ Store your charcoal in a dry location. Though the charcoal itself wonâ€™t be damaged by water, it re-ignites better if it is dry. If you are using charcoal for grill cooking, use a hammer to smash the larger piece of wood into manageable grill-sized pieces for even heating.\n\n**Step 9** â€“ Use your pit to make more charcoal. If you do not plan on making more charcoal, then fill the pit in to prevent accidents. If you are in a forested area, flood your pit with water to remove any potential smoulder pockets after you remove your charcoal.\n\n**Variations for Long-Term Charcoal Making**\n\nIf you want to make your own charcoal long-term, but donâ€™t want the tripping hazard of an open pit, then the only additional piece of equipment you need is an old metal garbage can, and another relatively air-tight container that will fit inside it. You can use these two containers to make a charcoal kiln, which provides a slightly more controlled way to create charcoal.\n\nPack your air-tight container tightly with wood. You want as little free space as you can reasonably get. You may want one or two vent holes; make them so that they will vent into the surrounding fire. Create a metal way to suspend the small container inside the larger can. Start a fire in the can, and sustain the burn for several hours. Let both cans cool completely, and remove your charcoal.\n\nThe kiln method can be used to create artistâ€™s charcoal using willow rods, or specific charcoals for use in fireworks and other pyro related activities. If you want to use charcoal for water purification, then making your own is one way to ensure that there are zero petroleum additives, or preservatives, in your wood.\n\nWhile making your own charcoal requires a small investment of time in setting up the burn, it is a very easy and efficient process. Charcoal is most commonly used in grills and smokers, but can also be used in standard woodstoves, wood cookstoves, or for blacksmithing, making it a very useful skill to learn and practice."

She passed away 2 years ago and my siblings and I decided since I was the only one without a real place of my own that I should move into the house and take care of it.\n\nI was overjoyed to move in as it was my childhood home. The only drawback was no hard-line internet. My choices for internet out here in the country are either satellite or mobile hotspot. I have come to the conclusion that satellite might be my best choice, but I will have to wait a few more weeks for that to become a reality.\n\nI use Straight Talk for my mobile phone provider and they've just come out with their 'Ultimate Unlimited' package. $55/month for \"unlimited\" data. It really isn't true unlimited though as the fine print reads \"_**If you use over 60GB of data we reserve the right to review your usage**_\". That's pretty much bullshit because if it were true unlimited they wouldn't give a fuck if you went over 60GB or not. The only reason I chose this option for now is that I need the internet at home to do work. I am using it right now as I write it and it's pretty fast really. 4G data.\n\nSo I basically tether my phone to my desktop and use the internet that way. What about you folks? Have you ever used a method such as this to procure your internet? Leave me your thoughts in the comments and have a great day! "

You have an address, weâ€™ll etch it.\"\n\nWe currently make wallets for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, DOGE, DASH, Monetary Unit, and Crown Coin. Our metal wallets our sturdy and fire resistant. You can carry these in your regular wallet because they are the size of a credit card. You can also stash these in your safe and not worry about them catching fire if something tragic does happen.\n\nNot only do we make the etched metal wallets, but we have what we call our 'Wearable Wealth' T-Shirts.\n\n![Bitcoin Wearable Wallet](img/bitcoinshirt.jpg)\n\nThe wallets and the shirts can have both the public key and the private key put on them. You're probably saying to yourself, \"THE PRIVATE KEY?!?!\". Yes, the private key for your wallet can be added through [BIP38 Encryption](http://bitstashers.com/generate-bip38-keys/). With BIP38 encryption you encrypt your private key with a password that only you know and no one can access it unless they know this password.\n\nWe hope you give us a look and if you have any questions then feel free to reach out to us via our email at orders@bitstashers.com. Have a great day!!\n\n"

We make and sell 3D mesh items for a game inside of [Second Life](http://www.secondlife.com) called LIFE2. The items we make get the [LIFE2 (Link to their Second Life Marketplace)](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/172425) scripts installed into them and then people can interact with our 3D mesh items.\n\nI have a dominatrix who is requesting various sex-related items to be made. The one that I am showcasing here is a sex shower for a dominatrix and her submissive. \n\n![Sex Shower 1](img/Sex_Shower_1.jpg)\n\nI design these things in [Blender3D](https://www.blender.org/) and I made all of these parts from scratch. Here's another shot\n\n![Sex Shower 2](img/Sex_Shower_2.jpg)\n\nWhen I design these items I use an OpenSim simulator hosted on my computer so that I can upload the finished mesh items for testing and tweaking. Uploading to Second Life costs money for each upload so it is easier and more cost effective to do the designing on my own machine before uploading to SL.\n\n![Sex Shower 3](img/Sex_Shower_3.jpg)\n\nThat's about it. I wanted to do a quick post just to show off a little. Thanks for viewing and I wish you all a blessed day :)"

In this day and age of television bombarding your eyes with all sorts of garbage; it's nice to revert back to the good old days when it was simple.\n\nAbbott & Costello have always been favorites of mine. I remember when I was a young child we used to watch their movies every Saturday on our local TV station. When I found the old time radio program that they used to do I was overjoyed.\n\nMy lady and I usually sit and listen to these in the evenings after I get home from work. We just love listening to these. The shows were funny and smart and they give your mind an exercise in visualization.\n\nI hope you enjoy them as much as I do. I am providing a magnet link below and will be seeding this if you'd like to pick these up for yourself. I can only seed these right now between the hours of 9AM - 6PM Eastern Standard Time so you'll know when to grab them.
