An ordinary jump with a parachute costs 2500-3500 rubles. That's about $43 .. $61. In tandem with the instructor $90 .. $160. Independent jumps of athletes from $15 (with your own parachute, probably?).",

Social networks also provide an opportunity for escapism, but provide a wider choice of habitat :) And to look at photos of cats and put them like it easier than even trying to get into the plot of a movie or a TV show and at the same time you feel your influence on the process :D",

But in 2014, approximately in the same perspective, everything looked so :)\n\n[![](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUBeESNkbHX7B2cVaeeHvpuHVg1rrwqFP5vyK7h2BQFnL/CAM00193-800x.jpg)](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWP1s9kiSoF7QfJvAi4PinSVqBWyscrof36KLd7e4Je4J/CAM00193.jpg)",
