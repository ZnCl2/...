Or is this on purpose?  (1) <marquee width=' 200px'>Oh, neat. The nerd blog.</marquee>\n\nI was testing the head form. Site.title parses html on the page, whereas ZeroHello it'll plaintext instead of strip. Best practice I guess would be to wrap /html/body/div[3]/h1/a[2] instead of scaring everyone (like I just did) with inappropriately placed html. Sorry about that :P",
