   <h1 align = center>About Court Society</h1>
    <div class="transbox">
    <p align = center> It is about collective music. I started doing this in 2010 when playing at standard rock bands became somethin really ego-centric. To get rid of ego battles and deals for a few I decided to make this by myself just because nobody else had any sort of idea of this before. In 2010 wrote Ultravioleta, a purely experimental music album about environmental topics; musically reflecting about climate change, pollution and big cities. In I wrote 2012 Plastic Shaman, an album about predictions and false positives.</p>
   <p1 align = center> It was in 2013 when I started with the idea of making Album Sessions. This means to release multiple albums about a single topic. Three album sessions were released between 2013 and 2014 (We're All Orgasmic, LOST SPCS and Idealized Baby respectively).</p1>
   <p2 align = center> 
Nowadays I'm into free and collaborative music. This is music where the notion of "author" doesn't exist, since it's taken as most of all a prejudicious word. Me among many other musicians show all of our music and everyone can gather the musical data for any purpose. This makes co-working possible and a lot of interest stuff happens.</p2>
   <p3 align = center> 
During professional carreer musical hacking is a common praxis. This means that everybody working with me do a lot of really fun music experiments that then we show to people so that they can understand what we do so they do the same or something very different (nobody should care about the other's actions in this sense). So I hope you have as much fun as I have becoming part of this! </p3>
