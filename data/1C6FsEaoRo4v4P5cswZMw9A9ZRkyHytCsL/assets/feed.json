(why are you looking HERE?)\n\nWhy did I make an INDEPENDENT website?\n\nWHY IN HELL would anyone want an INDEPENDANT WEBSITE apart from Blogger,wordpress,etc?\nThis is why\n\nPay attention to the fluke on the whale.\n\nMethinks the system is rigged torwards SILOS\n(Who can tell you what to say, and what not to say.)\n\nsocial media\n\nProfessional accounts are one thing- do not mince them- with personal accounts, please.\n\nI have seen loads of complaints that start like this:\n\n    Well my friends dont like (you, your website...)\n\n\nASK ME IF I CARE?\nASK ME IF I SOULD CARE?\n\n-Its not up to your friends to dick-tate my life(or me- or what I have to say).\n-If this was real life, Id say:\n\n    Move out\n    Find another place to hang\n    Find other friends\n    LEAVE\n    Enjoy your clic (and one-sided banter)\n    or Id ask you to walk away and never see me again.\n\n\n(you cant do all these online)\n\nMaybe instead of BITCHING about responses that you invite into the conversation on matters that matter-\nyou should roll with the punches and help remedy the situation?\n\nSocial media is designed to allow for comments from others.\nIf you dont want comments- push a BLOG. Then walk away.\n\nThis is a growing problem in phoenix. \nMany would rather instigate a fight- \n-and call on others as hitmen\n-than help solve the underlying problem.\n\n\n\n",

WE WERE HERE FIRST.)\nWE DO NOT HAVE A LOUISIANA \"HEDGEHOG BREEDER\" PARTNER.\n\n\nUSING OUR NAME WITHOUT EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION is grounds for a lawsuit. \nWe dont play when it comes to things like this.\n\n\n**US IP laws indicate Trademark \"is effective\" after 5 years without filing, or six months post filing an official trademark.**\n**This website HAS BEEN ONLINE THIS LONG.**\nMajor Site Interruptions were due to (ICANN and) ISP non-compliance with \"ICANN lockout regulations\"\n\n\n\nThe hand-drawn logo is FREEWARE. \nThe Japanese author states \"NO COMMERCIAL USE\".\nAll rights of it are reserved to her.\nThis is offered as symbolic representation ONLY.\n\n\n\n#### Did you want to \"Symbolically adopt\" instead?\n\nThats why we are here- to help you connect the dots.\nWhile we directly influence smaller lesser known care-ers and recues, other larger orgs like WWF and similar can also help.\n\nHere are two links in this case:\n\n[National Wildlife Foundation](https://www.shopnwf.org/Adoption-Center/Adopt-a-Hedgehog/index.cat)\n[WWF](https://gifts.worldwildlife.org/gift-center/gifts/Species-Adoptions/hedgehog.aspx)\n\n### Missing some UK Rescues?\n\nOverseas rescues need to provide direct payment info to be included here.\nAt this point this requires WU or eCurrency (such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.) details.\n\t\t\nNo, this info isnt going to be given out- its used for internal records only when the donations arrive.\t\n\nThis site/organization cannot (and WILL NOT) help YOU overseas in the UK, if we dont have your payment info.\t\nThis is an effort to globalize efforts to help the hedge. Not everyone lives in the UK.\n\n#### What we need from your UK org to be included\n\nCredit Cards /online processing:\n\nShopify and Stripe can **accept** donations (in USD) to US from \"our clients cards\" \n(its not setup right now -but we have an account)\n\nVISA/AMEX/MASTERCARD CANNOT and often WILL NOT help \"in international regards\".\nVery few ATMs overseas are \"international use\" and most cards have forced \"vacation policies\" restricting \n\"international transactions\" online.\n\n(We have a problem buying from ebay from time to time because of this.)\n\n\n\nPayment will be made to YOU , (the UK care-er) in the following manners:\n\n\nPayPal:\n\n\t\tSORRY. NO.\n\t\t\nPaypal has \"scamming issues\" with \"international funds\" for some reason.\nWhy YOU put up with asking for credit cards from overseas clients- is beyond us- with this scam going on.\n\n\nFor Cash(WU):\n\n\t\tWe need to know where and how to send a \"Western Union wire\" to you.\n\t\t(This will be checked -as best possible- for accuracy- before anything is sent)\n\nNOTE: \n\n\t\tWESTERN UNION HAS HIGH FEES, BITCOIN (and alts) DO NOT\n\nUnder NO CIRCUMSTANCES are we becoming a man-in-the-middle WU agent. \n(There are enough scams going on)\n\n\nThe donation becomes property of SOUTHERN HEDGEHOGS, THEN as WE direct it- goes overseas to UK care giver.\n(We ALREADY HAVE THE FUNDS BEFORE THE WU IS INITIATED.)\n\nAlthough we have very little overhead, nobody will be making WU demands of US.\nIf caught, this will be reported to FBI and Homeland Security.\n(FBI has international reach)\n\n\nThere will most likely be a few days delay minimum before WU is re-sent overseas to prevent fraud.\nWe will only be acting on \"what is recieved\", not \"pledges\", so DO NOT ASK.\n\nLocal (to US) breeders and care givers have PRIORITY- as this organization is based in the US.\n\n\n\n\nFor Coins(BTC/LTC/ETH):\n\n\t\tWe only need GDAX (or coinbase) username, or COIN wallet ID (public key).\n\t\tSkrill, CoinBase, COIN WALLET(directly), etc. cash out in your local currency- not USD.\n\nCoinbase, GDAX, Skrill are sent directly to your account.\nCOIN WALLET(ID) payments are handled ON THE NETWORK, directly from us.It is completely P2P in nature.\n\nOnce sent- we have nothing to do with it. Its very much like WESTERN UNION.\nYou wait for network confirmation, and send to an exchange or system(like coinbase) of choice and you get FIAT.(CASH)\n\n\nThe issues with \"outsiders altering a websites COIN DEPOSIT addresses\" are not possibe- \n\n\t\t1- THERE IS NO DATABSE. (Jekyll outputs FLAT HTML- this site is rendered locally, then uploaded)\n\t\t2- WE DONT POST THAT INFO DIRECTLY ANYMORE.\n\t\t\nThis \"HACK\" would require either completely hacking personal computers(obvious) or completely hacking our ISP\njust to rewrite one line of HTML- which can get over-ridden at any time BY US.\t\n(Its not worth the effort)\t\n\n\n\nNot accepting Bitcoin, (or cryptocurrencies in general) is a YUGE financial mistake.\nYou are limiting business transactions at your country's borders.\nWith exception of WU- other \"financial companies\" will not solve this headache for you.\n\n\n\n\n### Legal (Financial) \n\n-This site (and organization) is/are born and raised in Phoenix,AZ.\nAll Legal questions fall under US and AZ laws and are dealth with accordingly.\n\n(I dont see why you couldnt write this off on your taxes- once we acquire 501c3 status.\nHowever, I would not recommend doing so until \"notice is posted\".\nYOU WILL SEE IT PROUDLY POSTED.)\n\n\n\n### Hedgehog-like Products offered:\n\nThere are awesome products, a lot come from China (1 week airmail is the solution, with added cost)\nThe \"SLOW BOAT from CHINA\" is a \"real thing\". It often takes 30 days or more for mail to arrive.\n\n\n        We are searching for another commercial merchant due to dropshipping issues discovered. \n        While we dont like fraud either, neither you- nor us- should be \"taken for a ride\".\n\nPlease stand by.\nApologies.\n\n\n-Thank you for looking.\n\n\n\n",
