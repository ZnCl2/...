</code></pre><p>Copyright law is published information. So is TradeMark.</p><pre><code>    However, laws are not static as some assume.
</code></pre><p>It can be assumed that a “movie production” is Copywrighted and not produced locally by everyone.<br /> It is morally and ethically correct to remove offensive content. However-</p><pre><code>    Abusing DMCA laws to violate FairUSE is not legal.
</code></pre><p>I see it all the time. Ive been hit with bogus notices before. I did nothing wrong.</p> <hr /> <p>I updated my computer thru fileHippo. My ISP sent me a virus that infected my entire LAN.<br /> Im am owed 10K by ComCast and Spectrum dba Charter internet.<br /> They misdirected ME (my browser) as a DNS service provider- sending ME to the wrong place.</p><pre><code>    They want to blame the website- ultimately they misdirected my browser.
    Its not my fault. FileHippo is a "known clean" DL area.
</code></pre><p>I got hit with a DMCA notice for that. <br /> How is updating my computer- UNFAIR?</p> <hr /> <p>It is assumed that you didnt produce the (Copyrighted) content- if you are claiming “Fair USE”.</p> <p>Trying to impose extravagant workarounds for legal loopholes ALLOWED under the law- is forbidden by law.<br /> (you are trying to circumvent a LEGAL END USERs rights -by trying to impose another set of laws)<br /> <br /></p> <p>If you produced it- its your work to do with as you please.</p> <h3 id="the-internet-archives">The internet archives??</h3> <p>This is supposed to be by LEGAL nature for those who have already purchased (and physically own)<br /> a copy of the HARDWARE(ROM) or software. This counts as an ARCHIVE COPY- albeit a public one.<br /> <br /></p> <p>(In many cases this is abused- people download from here without checks if they bought the wares already)</p> <h3 id="drm">DRM</h3> <p>DRM was supposed to be a “did I buy that”? Copyright check.</p> <p>STEAM , APPLE MUSIC,etc (DRM) are used to make things LEGALLY COMPLIANT w distribution.</p> <p>(YOU DID PAY FOR IT- there is a DRM record of said)<br /> Unfortunately said DRM record is DEFECTIVE BY DESIGN.</p><pre><code>    ANY AND ALL KEYS can be IRREVERSIBLY REVOKED AT ANY TIME.
    (THIS IS WHAT EACH MKB version on BLU-RAYs effectively does)
</code></pre><p>You read that right-</p><pre><code>    EVERYTIME you insert a DISC- it updates your player **without consent**.
    YOU CANNOT GO BACK. IT IS A "blown eFUSE" and "flash rewrite".
</code></pre><p>The trick expanded from the XBOX 360- Ill describe this in a bit.</p> <h3 id="cdrom">CDROM</h3> <p>This is usually older games and Music CDs.</p> <p>While frowned on- copying this (at least for HOME USE) is NOT ILLEGAL.<br /> DISTRIBUTION is ILLEGAL. (You cannot make more than ONE copy.)</p> <p>There is intentionally no law on the books regarding importation or copying of CDROM data or audio.<br /> There is actually a reverse law ALLOWING it/circumventing lockouts because a computer drive<br /> is NOT a “audio player” nor “recording device”.</p> <p>Many game developers and RIAA/MPAA, etc retaliated by adding in bad sectors or <br /> screwing with the ability to read the disc correctly without certain software running.</p> <p>PS2 titles are riddled with issues like these, transparent to the real hardware and end user.</p> <h3 id="dvdbdrom">DVD+BDROM</h3> <p>Im talking about movies for the most part.</p> <p>The mini definition reads:</p><pre><code>    For PERSONAL, non COMMERCIAL and NONPublic distribution thereof (at home/office).
</code></pre><p>It does not read DISEMENATION, copying(beyond one “archive” copy), or torrenting.</p> <p>Laws have changed-</p> <p>The law now reads:</p><pre><code>    USER CAN "CIRCUMVENT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY" ANY and ALL forms of DRM lockouts
    INCLUDING PATCHING OF (DVD/BDROM) DRIVE FIRMWARE.
</code></pre><p>MPAA and RIAA want you to “comply with thier rules” on watching movies on Linux<br /> (The reason is that they dont want to support software on these platforms)</p> <p>HOWEVER- THis is not legally enforced- just the opposite.</p><pre><code>    Linux playback is allowed by law.
    Cracking the DISC is ALLOWED by law. (this is the recent change)
</code></pre><p>BDROM (movies) have 3 keys-(3DES encryption is used):</p><pre><code>    ONE of 3 keys is in hardware sold to you at the computer store-
    ONE is in the player software (windows/mac)- this is missing on Linux -
    ONE is on disc (normally in an unreadable sector of the disc)
</code></pre><p>If you can get to the Title key(on disc) the movie is watchable.</p> <p><strong>This is a big deal.</strong></p> <p>Computer law intentionally allowed archival copy since early 90s.</p> <p>Industry doesnt like this- tries to modify hardware to stop you.<br /> The law says- this is now illegal.</p> <p>The law doesnt stop manufacturers from producing locked drives, however.<br /> This was part of the “region free” fiasco years ago.</p> <p>1- you would buy the disc (lets say in a Japanese store) of an American title<br /> 2- your player reads as an American system and rejects the Japanese disc</p> <p>Changes are limited. <br /> Reigion free drives let you play the movie. <br /> Region locked ones require a limited change (efuse) to be made (popped) first.<br /> You cannot keep going back and forth. You have five switches. PERIOD.</p> <p>3- You buy a movie in an American store- or on base but want to watch it too.</p> <p>The old premise was to buy two players. <br /> Then Region FREE (sans check) drives (and patches) came around.</p> <p>The law just let you use those drive patches to watch all of your DVDs on.</p> <h3 id="video-games">VIDEO GAMES</h3> <p>This is a HOT TOPIC.</p> <p>As Ive said:</p><pre><code>    INDUSTRY wants one thing- yet the LAW says something else.
</code></pre><p>You will notice if you look hard enough tha most discs read:</p><pre><code>    DO NOT MAKE ILLEGAL COPIES OF THIS DISC
</code></pre><p>some read(due to legal retaliation):</p><pre><code>    DO NOT MAKE (ANY) COPIES OF THIS DISC
</code></pre><p>The latter is incorrect legally. <br /> YOU may make ONE COPY. <br /> FOR YOU. <br /> AT HOME or the office(preferably at home-you boss will kill you).</p> <p>The former is CORRECT. <br /> You are not making an ILLEGAL COPY - because ONE “archive” COPY is ALLOWED by law.</p> <p>In most cases you have to modify the console (or drive) to enable this functionality.</p> <p>However, in reality-</p><pre><code>    ANY COPY not produced at the stomping factory is deemed ILLEGAL by SONY and MICROSOFT(nintendo?).
</code></pre><p>Your unit becomes BANNED ONLINE once you boot a copy and connect to the servers.</p> <p>The 360 uses check bits (code) inside of an embedded “movie logo” partition on most games.<br /> If data (or timing or reads of which) doesnt match M$FT specs- the game will not boot.<br /> The game will not boot whatsoever- without these check bit movie partitions on “copies”.<br /> Further- you must have the correct check bit partition.</p> <p>Sony took this up a notch with Blu-Ray -using the “Java engine” in the player.</p> <p>Technically booting a game backup is a “user agreement violation”-</p><pre><code>    While they cant legally stop you from booting a backup-
    These companies forbid you from playing online with one.
</code></pre><p>Its not illegal, nor wrong. These companies just impose “draconian laws” on you.</p> <p>Quite Frankly - Ill keep my backups, Thank You.<br /> AND-</p><pre><code>    I did pay for that, often several times. 
    Why should I pay for it again?
    Then when I do- you remove the game, content, or DRM key?
</code></pre><p>-Thats stealing from the consumer.</p> <p>NOW WHO’S STEALING from WHOM?<br /> Your companies call this stealing when its legal- just as long as it suits YOUR needs.<br /> But when the law supports the consumers, you wont fess up to it.</p><pre><code>    I dont want my $$, microsoft. I want what I paid for. (give us the book)
</code></pre><p>In case of VALVE/STEAM:</p><pre><code>    The OLD version, please. Not this "NEW SHIT".
</code></pre><hr /> <h3 id="headlines">headlines</h3> <p>The media in question as of late- was something the media got a hold of.<br /> No reference was made to the photographer or his staff on a supposed copyrighted image.</p> <p>While not legally obligated- the paper (USA TODAY) <br /> -may be ethically (or morally obligated) to remove said media.</p> <p>IT IS PLGARISM, however, and serious consequences can develop.</p> <p>The right thing to do is-</p><pre><code>    Give credit to others for thier work
    -or-
    remove thier content.
</code></pre><p>Members of the Media are supposed to filter out and know what plagarism is. They work hard (or supposed to work hard) to prevent such adverse actions.<br /></p> <p>However-</p><pre><code>    Complaining that YOUR "copyrighted image" leaked to the media 
</code></pre><p>-or-</p><pre><code>    you complain once it becomes property of a paper company (news organization)
</code></pre><p>your complaints will fall on deaf ears.</p> <p>1st Ammendment rights (from the Editor and news agency) steps in at this point.<br /> Your media becomes a part of “Journalistic Priviledge”.</p> <p>Some Media organizations abide by this better than others, it seems.<br /> (sleeze in this dept. isnt good…)</p> <h2 id="images-including-here">images (including here)</h2> <p>Images not taken by me will have sources listed.<br /> I will not take credit for your work. That is wrong.</p> <p>If you really insist-<br /> I can find other images to use. <br /> Id rather (reasonably) pay for permission(its easier).</p> <p>Thumbnails are for demonstratum purpose. <br /> They assist in undestanding of the material.<br /> They are legally used for viewing purposes, not distribution -and are permitted by law.</p> <p>Site Rippers and spider bots have been known to steal content. <br /> (One can only auto-ban so much of this.)</p> <p>The tweet read earlier:</p><pre><code>    "you cant just take things from the internet and.."
</code></pre><p>correction:</p><pre><code>    It is morally unethical and immoral to steal (MEDIA) content of the entire internet wo consent.
    (you can do -whatever you want- we hope the law catches up to you)
</code></pre><p>The definition of PUBLIC DOMAIN (the internet- a published website- or any other ONLINE CONTENT) by itself-<br /> (although in respect to copyright) allows such PERSONAL USE.</p><pre><code>    To view the image, you download (cache) a PERSONAL COPY. 
    (If you save it elsewhere- thats your business)
</code></pre><p>as per illegal distribution (serving the content) Copyright law allows it under SOME guidelines:</p><pre><code>    PERSONAL USE
    ILLUSTRATIVE USE (to illustrate a point of view)
    To help define a subject matter (educational context)       
</code></pre><p>OTHER USES ARE ILLEGAL. NOT THESE.</p> <p>The premise of yesteryear is thus ( I suggest people take this to heart):</p><pre><code>    If its on the internet- its fair game.
</code></pre><p>This is not to say TAKE personal CREDIT for someone else work.<br /> (That is plagarism. QUOTE ALL SOURCES.)</p> <p>If you think someone STOLE something-<br /> the question should be-</p><pre><code>    HOW DID YOU ACQUIRE SUCH?
</code></pre><p>DO NOT presume such a situation is a “Copyright violation”. <br /> -or deserves a DMCA takedown notice.</p> <p>One may be warranted, however, for plagarism. Complain to the webhost or ISP.<br /> (Web Host can be found out usually by using ‘whois’ or looking at the ‘whois database’.)</p> <hr /> <p>Ive done my homework. <br /> I see others points of view.</p> <p>Disagreeing is non-unamerican. <br /> I just dont like betty banter because someone has a different view -or misunderstands the (changing) law.<br /> I cant describe this to you in a “300 letters or less” tweet.</p> <p>For THAT- Im sorry.</p> <p>I am no lawyer- this is laymans interpretation based upon published laws.<br /> Please consult(your probably flawed) legal council of any detailed questions on this matter.</p> <p>-J</p> </article> <p></p> <font color=blue> <a href="https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=./blog2/04-21-2019-fairUse.html&title=MultiMedia Fair Use"> <span class="glyph fs1 icon-facebook"></span> </a> <a href="http://twitter.com/share?url=./blog2/04-21-2019-fairUse.html&title=MultiMedia Fair Use&amp;text=MultiMedia Fair Use"> <span class="glyph fs1 icon-twitter"></span> </a> <!-- <a href="web+mastodon://share?text=MultiMedia Fair Use - ./blog2/04-21-2019-fairUse.html"> <span class="glyph fa1 icon-twitter"></span> </a> --> </font> <br> <br /> </div> </div> <!-- container --> <!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/js/main.js"></script> --> <script type="text/javascript" src="../assets/js/popper.js"></script> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> </body> <footer> <div class="container"> <hr> <h3>Southern Hedgehogs </h3> <center>-A place where hedgehogs can gather, hang out and tell stories.<br></center> <br> <p></p> <center> Think of all the wee wittle hedge-hoggies in need, please!<br> Not all of them have a mother- some need HUEman help!<br> <a href="https://commerce.coinbase.com/checkout/16d124e7-fa56-47e8-b8a6-4817cc137f86"> Paying by coin? </a> <script src="../assets/js/checkout.js"></script> <a href='https://link2payment.co/s/d074'>&nbsp; &nbsp; Or perhaps credit?</a> <br>A TEN spot goes a long way..<br> </center> <!-- social icons sets (RSS) --> <div class="nocenter"> <a href="../feed.html"><img src="../images/rss-feed.jpg"></a> </div> &nbsp; <div class="nocenter"> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@snazzyfrazz"><img src="../images/mastodon.jpg" ></a> </div> &nbsp; <br> <a href="../legal.html">Legal-eeze</a><br> <a href="../tags.html">Tag List</a><br> <br> Background Image (c) 2005 Richard Jasmin: Huis-Ten-Bosch, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan <br> Website CopyLeft &copy; 2015-2019 Southern Hedgehogs <br> Last Updated: 22 Apr 2019 <br> <p></p> <p></p> <script src="../assets/js/simple-jekyll-search.min.js"></script> <script> window.simpleJekyllSearch = new SimpleJekyllSearch({ searchInput: document.getElementById('search-input'), resultsContainer: document.getElementById('results-container'), json: './search.json', searchResultTemplate: '<li><a href="{url}" title="{desc}">{title}</a></li>', noResultsText: 'No results found', limit: 10, fuzzy: false }) </script> <style> #JBcugvGdAytS { display: none; margin-bottom: 30px; padding: 20px 10px; background: #D05C0D; text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: #fff; border-radius: 5px; } </style> <div id="JBcugvGdAytS"> No feed for ewe...Turn off your adblocker if you want food.
