The hope is to correct this bad behaviour.</p> <p>As I said, MKULTRA STOPPED in the 60s.</p> <p>There have been only two reported deaths. <br /> One was falling from a high hotel mysteriously, one was the candidate ‘fluke’.</p> <p>As per project STARGATE, although it <em>could</em> be ongoing on Long Island at Montauk facility,<br /> the facility <strong>officially shut down years ago as a state park</strong>.</p> <p>There appears to be a satellite facing up from a satellite facing down image if you look close enough.</p> <p>The facility has a rotary dish mount there(TV? Radio, HAM, RADAR?). <br /> But otherwise almost appears DEAD, and same with any project in that area<br /> -with exception of maybe some large scale digging in recent years.</p> <p>Some of the DoD project participants remain alive and well, practicing in other related (psy-op)<br /> projects to help the greater good. I believe the lead project team member has written a book.<br /> -His name is Major Ed Dames.</p> <h2 id="marks-of-the-beast">marks of the beast</h2> <p>As per the “chipped 666 rice grain implants”…those are optional, dont connect that way,<br /> businesses were forced- “by the religious zealoutous folks” - to cease production.</p> <p>They are used as an ID badge at only SOME corporations. <br /> They do NOT tie into any major systems like Social Security or the like.</p> <p>Even if they did, as some off-planet places use similar, <br /> it serves no purpose than to ID you as a legitimate citizen and benefit recipient.<br /> (its much like a green card or passport)</p> <p>Hard to mess with a piece of hardware you cant remove. <br /> But we only do that in certain circumstances.</p> <h2 id="niburu2012-rehashes">Niburu2012 Rehashes</h2> <p>-I am seeing more and more of these as of late.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>OMG OMG OMG the world is ending– and you need to live in <font color="red">FEAR</font><br /> Heaven forbid something DEVESTAING HITS planet earth by PROPHESY…(TC4 asteroid is real however)</p> <p><br /></p> <p>ALIENS ARE COMING TO RAPE YOUR MIND AND SCREW YOUR BODY!!!!<br /> Youre gonna be thier lunch or “clone hosting mother…”</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The FEDERATION DID IT!
