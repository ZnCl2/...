      <p>This is Ubuntu v16 LTS copy via “Disc by Mail”.<br />
AKA: I have it, I copy it, I give it to you.</p>
<p>DVD are about $1 a piece, you are paying for shipping.<br /> 
Linux is FREE and I dont intent on charging $50 for it.<br />
But not everyone has a decent high speed internet connection,apparently.</p>
<p>This is OK, preferred over Debian. Not quite BLEEDING EDGE.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>For 16, the ATI driver dropped Catalyst in favor of AMDGPU. If you need or prefer CATALYST (ahem miners..), you need to let me know when purchasing or by follow up email.Thusly, I would give you v14 instead. CATALYST CANNOT be installed on v16.</p>
