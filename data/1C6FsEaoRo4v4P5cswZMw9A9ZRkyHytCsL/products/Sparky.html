    <p>Sparky</p>
    <p>
      <p>This is Debian “STRETCH” (the squid) version 9 (NINE) LIVE disc copy via “Disc by Mail”.<br />
AKA: I have it, I copy it, I give it to you.</p>
<p>DVD are about $1 a piece, you are paying for shipping.<br /> 
Linux is FREE and I dont intent on charging $50 for it.<br />
But not everyone has a decent high speed internet connection,apparently.</p>
<p>This disc is meant for rescue and not meant so much for installation.<br />
It will get you on the internet or up and running FAST.</p>
