    <p>Debian(stretch)</p>
    <p>
      <p>This is Debian “STRETCH” (the squid) version 9 (NINE) pre-release copy via “Disc by Mail”.<br />
AKA: I have it, I copy it, I give it to you.</p>
<p>DVD are about $1 a piece, you are paying for shipping.<br /> 
Linux is FREE and I dont intent on charging $50 for it.<br />
But not everyone has a decent high speed internet connection,apparently.</p>
<p>This is pre-release not because “Im testing it” but because it hadnt gone “final” yet.<br /></p>
<p>It is more than stable despite not yet being the “Stable” release candidate.<br />
What this means is that the development libraries are current and not old and funky, requiring a headache to update.</p>
<p>You will have to update it to the latest packages, but you would have to do that anyways.<br />
So being pre-release by a few months is not really that big of a deal for Debian.</p>
<p>Do be aware that “reportbug” is bugged and reporting issues is a ROYAL PAIN.</p>
<p>This is offered for the “I want something STABLE” types of users.<br />
I have releases for noobs, and ones more easy to use, and then BLEEDING EDGE.</p>
