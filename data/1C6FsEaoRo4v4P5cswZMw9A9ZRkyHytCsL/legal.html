(as best as can be recollected)</p> <p>The only similar events would be those of the Star Trek series.</p> <p>The events and technology eluded to here and in the TNG tech manuals, which is close to reality, are purely coincidental.</p> <p>Persons and events referenced in any public work are based on authors concept and present to reader as such for thier understanding and no other purpose.</p> <p>Names of organizations have been jumbled by Secret Government shadow organizations and places with no name,<br /> some of which are alluded to in Doc. Micheal Wolf (the “Majestic special studies group” leaker) book “catchers of heaven”.<br /> (out of print)</p> <p>It is of note that contact has seemed to have occured and is in fact occuring with ET races, <br /> which the US and other Governments are trying to keep quiet about.</p> <p>It seems that a “Federation” does in fact exist. <br /> Howver, the details are wide, varied, and extremely classified.</p> <h4 id="sonic">Sonic:</h4> <p>Although its not possible to trademark a living being, all products of said being[entity] whether living or dead are subject to trademark.</p> <p>Dont believe me? Lookup the basketball player, Shaq.</p> <p>A hedgehog is a living insectivore. Sonic, in this case is a description of personification and behaviors of a hedgehog.</p> <p>-Mind you one of Pleadian-ish descent and coloring.</p> <p>SEGA, the SEGA logo, the SONIC TEAM logo, and SONIC THE HEDGEHOG are either registered trademarks or trademarks of SEGA Corporation. <br /></p> <p>All rights reserved. again, same as above. Names not witheld. Events happened in similar way. But the tech and star systems are REAL. I <em>told</em> you I had proof, didnt I?</p> <p>It would be very improper to keep naming all hedgehogs Sonic.<br /> (Please pick something more original for your pet..)</p> <h4 id="website">Website</h4> <p>This theme, and site code is <b>MIT /Expat Licensed</b>.
