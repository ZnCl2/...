Nothing could be further from\nthe actuall reality.\nMy research ,many many hours with a telescope and online has pointed to the earth being flat and Time Travel being a reality , imagine if you will a time continuum \"parcelled\" off into Real Estate with timelords who own these epochs or chunks of the continuum , fanciful you say ? Take a good look at your reality , it's a B horror movie . and getting worse by the second , are our local timelord masters having fun and kinky entertainment at our expense ?\n\nI postulate that our domain we call earth was probably a construct (maybe virtual) built to culture and protect and has been captured and enslaved...

			"body": "Seriously , no exchanges , no native coin scheme , looks like Im gonna be a busy puppy...\n\nAs everyone on zeronet will be able at access the record data , my gut says that\"exchange signing\" may be an answer and units are exchanged and signed by old and new owners in the deal ...and the resulting hash is then propagated , old void hashes are deleted after a set period say 2 weeks if there are no challenges to the exchange .. \n\nThere could be of course many different schema's and I have not pondered on this for long would be keen to hear other proposals for a zeronet currency ...\n\nI sort of thinking out loud here , but my take id that ALL CRYPTO'S are used in exchanges kinda like \"atomic swaps\" and a base exchange mechanism using DOGECOIN or BYTECOIN would instantly monetise the zeronet coin which is essentially and exchange instrument",
