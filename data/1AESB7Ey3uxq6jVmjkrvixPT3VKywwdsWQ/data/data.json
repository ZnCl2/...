			"body": "I initially heard about ZeroNet, oh idk... a couple or few months ago and was interested in trying it out. I hadn't done that until just recently. I had tried other projects (like [Project Maelstrom](http://project-maelstrom.bittorrent.com/)). ZeroNet is a little different. First, I feel like ZeroNet is quite a bit refined for how early in development it is. Everything seems to work without a problem. I really like the idea of a decentralized website and got curious on how to create one despite my lack of web development skills. I quickly learned how to get a website up and running along with how ZeroNet works. I explored the different sites available on ZeroNet and throughout my experience, everything worked and people were friendly. So far everything is positive. Now I just need to learn how to use ZeroNet to the fullest... as it is different than traditional web development."
