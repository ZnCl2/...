I do acknowledge that, yes, an extremely powerful computer could, if focused on doing so, brute force an individuals encryption key.\n> I have a concept my dad told me, and ill first phrase it as an analogy. We all know how powerful guns are. The average person does not live in fear of being shot, because there is almost no reason for them to be targeted. If you stand out from the crowd, you will be far more likely to be targeted because you aren't just the average person anymore.\n> When you think about it, there are far too many of your average encryption keys for anyone to be able to crack them all. Sure, if someone (or a government) targeted one person for whatever reason, they would be able to do it with the assistance of a (15 million dollar) computer. When you start protecting yourself way over the average amount, you stand out from the rest and become a target. There is safety in numbers.

I don't have anything to hide\"\n\nGlenn Greenwald in Why privacy matters - TED Talk:\nOver the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, \"I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide.\" I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, \"Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide.\" Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.\n\n\"You are being watched. Private and state-sponsored organizations are monitoring and recording your online activities. privacytools.io provides knowledge and tools to protect your privacy against global mass surveillance\"\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/14gSEpfWfF5Go7u5y7UidZQCnGa6eSBYZ9/",

If God killed who insisted to be prophet, He wouldn't kill who insisted that is his Son? That was the justification of Jesus's killers, that also considered him as false prophet.
