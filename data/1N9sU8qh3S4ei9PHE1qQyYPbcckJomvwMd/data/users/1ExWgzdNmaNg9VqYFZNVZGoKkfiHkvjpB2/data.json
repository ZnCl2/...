Forking is not the solution because it will induce more splitting user base and less and less video variety on each plateform... That's the problem right now with KopyKate: 2/3 chinese accounts uploading porn long time ago and no new non porn video to make more views and remove them from the frontpage... The real solution is to aggregate all those plateform so there is more content and statistically more chance to not have porn on frontpage... ",
