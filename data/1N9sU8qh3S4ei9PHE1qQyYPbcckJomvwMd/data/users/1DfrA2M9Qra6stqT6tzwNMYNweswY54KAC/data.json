Which is problematic since github is now microsoft and(as a platform) *cannot* be trusted anymore.\nThere are probably a few more things I overlooked since I don't know the structure of framework.js, but I highly recommend downloading the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en)(clearnet) and debugging it code on there, too.",

			"body": "In my point of view:\nReligion was necessary in the past to keep a large group of people stable. Nowadays we have a good set of morals and rules, under which we know, that a large number of people can reasonably live. These rules no longer require a magical being of infinite+1 power to keep you from breaking those rules, because the laws and governments, that enforce them, already take that place(a mighty enemy(?) that you cannot overcome). \nThis holds true for any religion, you have a set of rules to keep a big population of people stable, a set of rules that guarantee the survival of the religion and a set of miscellaneous rules that are often specific to one given religion.",
