If you can find me a css framework that can not only have a bar at the bottom, but can also have a navbar that slides up (basically a bottom shade), then I'll experiment with your design.",

You do this constantly, and to *everyone*. You even have the *nerve* to call other people lazy because they aren't updating their zites, and would call out nofish for not using this big amount of money he has lying around, except... right, he doesn't actually have that much money. **So, yes, I do think you are a big jerk.**",
