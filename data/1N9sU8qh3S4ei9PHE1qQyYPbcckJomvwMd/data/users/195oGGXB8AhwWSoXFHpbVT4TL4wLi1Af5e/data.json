It can't be done by the server (as there are no servers in Zeronet), and it is probably not practical to do it in the user's browser using Javascript either. These video sites rely on a competent uploader anyway, as you need to upload video that is optimized for the web (correct audio and video codec, appropriate bitrate and resolution in order to keep size down, with proper MOOV atom placement, etc)",
