This will keep happening as long as people keep demonizing the sharing of information, images, audio, video, etc. IMO the better focus would be to push for the law to not harm, punish, imprison, etc. those who have merely viewed or shared things online; regardless of content. We don't imprison people for sharing videos of murders. We don't imprison people for sharing videos of crimes. So why imprison people for sharing 'illegal' content? It doesn't follow and just harms privacy, safety, and easy access of information.\n\nAs for filtering/avoiding content you don't like or support on ZeroNet: I definitely think there should be better ways of managing what content you do and don't want to view. Primarily through shareable block lists, and allowing controversial sites to have a disclaimer before visiting. As well as stricter controls on proxies.",
