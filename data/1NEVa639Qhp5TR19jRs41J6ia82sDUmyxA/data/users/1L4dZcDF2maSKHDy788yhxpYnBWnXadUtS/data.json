Users should be able to mark porn and content management systems show some icon or such to warn adult content is inside. Also bothers me content that promote violence and hate. I seen it on ZeroVoat and ZeroPools i think, but it is rare (so far).",

But i would not delete my gmail as i have too many website accounts that are using it as a point of contact, i hope Google will never close my account. I do not know about any better freemail. I agree some things really needs to be re-started / started a new.",
