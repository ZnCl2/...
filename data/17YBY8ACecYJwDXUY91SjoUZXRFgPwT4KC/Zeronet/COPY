We believe in open, free, and uncensored communication-
so we built a network that is:

[4 button collapsible menu bar, mouseover/event click transitions]


+DISTRIBUTED
[
//Share entire sites on a peer to peer basis.//

-The more peers access your site, the faster and more reliable it's shared with others!
-Sites are shared using webtorrent technology.
-No central point or server vulnerable to shut down.
-Prove and update your authorship of sites using BIP32- the same cryptography that keeps your bitcoin wallet safe.
]



+SIMPLE
[
//Easy to use for both users and developers.//

-Download, unpack and get browsing without extra configuration.
-Use cryptographically safe BIP32 identities in place of passwords.
-Build your own sites easily and quickly using coffeescript and debug tools.
-Assign human readable .bit domain names to your sites using Namecoin.
]



+DYNAMIC
[
//Create and use multi-user websites updated in real time.//

-Sites are served by visitors and thus scalable without significant costs.
-Site functionality is expandable through plugins.
]



+FREE
[
//Privacy friendly and censorship resistant.//

-Sites are saved locally, so you can keep browsing them even without an active internet connection!
-No single point of failure- as long as one peer still has a copy to share, your site will remain accessible.
-You can use Tor Browser to share sites through the Tor network and keep your browsing activity private.
-Compatible with the modern web browser of your choice.
-Open Source -  Everyone can examine and contribute to the source code!
