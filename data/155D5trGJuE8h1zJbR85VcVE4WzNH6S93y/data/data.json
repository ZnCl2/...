I had to use a [Javascript beautifier](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1GQEPcjssbkvT1BsbNKUBSo4U9U7JisBxC) just so I could read the damn files, and then of course it doesn't help when I barely know how CSS works and I have to basically use trial-and-error to figure out what color codes go to what.\n\n---\n\nNow that I'm \"done,\" I don't even know if the changes have been published correctly. For all I know, it is working on my computer, but everyone else sees the standard ZeroBlog design. Can someone please comment on this post to let me know if it is working for you?"

			"body": "I wanted to let everyone know about a tool they can use to download their torrents that in some cases will make their downloads complete insanely fast. It's a free cloud-based BitTorrent client called [Seedr](https://www.seedr.cc/?r=58221) that downloads the torrent onto a remote server, then lets you do a super fast HTTP download of the file after it completes.\n\n---\n\nSo why is this faster than typical BitTorrent clients? Well, if anyone else has already used Seedr to download the exact same torrent, Seedr will just intelligently copy over the existing downloaded files into your account. No need for them to download all over again. This is most useful with more popular downloads, like the latest TV episodes and movies, which will then be able to zip straight from their server to your hard drive with none of the usual peer-leecher-tracker-piece-hash-etc. overhead.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Seedr takes privacy seriously and doesn't save your info to give to whatever government agencies ask for it, but always practice Internet safety. At the end of the day, you are the only person you can trust, so act accordingly.\n\nFull disclosure: I DON'T work for Seedr, they have NOT paid me anything for this review, and I am receiving NO compensation of any kind from them. They have no idea who I am or that I'm writing this. However, if you use the signup link above to create an account, both of our maximum cloud spaces will get a 250 MB increase (free accounts are limited to 2 GB of space initially, which can be increased in various ways, including referrals). I'm definitely taking advantage of this, and you should too, but this doesn't at all affect my review of the site. I am recommending it because I genuinely think it is a good service that can really speed up your downloads in a lot of cases.\n\nEnjoy!"

I do my best to keep the highest quality files possible (maximum 1080p).\n\n---\n\nMy selection criteria is totally subjective and completely arbitrary. In other words, if I like the show or movie, I download it. If not, I don't. End of story.
