Even so the tax contribution of a low paid worker doesn't cover the cost of the welfare supporting the person who 'does not want to do that job'.\nBut worse that able migrant has left their community, leaving a capacity gap behind. Once many of the able bodied folks from a community leave, the community is left with children, infirm or elderly, and so the community the migrant left is impacted.\nI think we need a big change in policy and attitudes, where we help bring all communities uptown a decent social and economic standard.",
