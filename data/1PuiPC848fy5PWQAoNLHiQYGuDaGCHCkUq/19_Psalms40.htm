</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:1">40:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I waited patiently on Jehovah, / And He inclined to me / And heard my cry.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:2">40:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He brought me up out of a pit of destruction, / Out of the miry clay; / And He set my feet upon a rock, / Establishing my steps.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:3">40:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He put a new song in my mouth, / A praise to our God. / Many see <I>it</I> and fear, / And they trust in Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:4">40:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Blessed is the man / Who makes Jehovah his trust / And does not turn to the proud / Or to those who turn aside after deception.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:5">40:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful deeds which You have done / And Your thoughts toward us; / They cannot be set in order unto You. / Were I to declare and speak of them, / They would be too numerous to recount.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:6">40:6 &nbsp;</A></B> You do not delight in sacrifice and offering; / You have prepared ears for Me; / You do not require burnt offering and sin offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:7">40:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I said, / Behold, I have come; / In the scroll of the book / It is written concerning Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:8">40:8 &nbsp;</A></B> I delight in doing Your will, O My God; / Indeed Your law is within My inward parts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:9">40:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I bear tidings of righteousness / In the great congregation. / Behold, I will not withhold My lips; / O Jehovah, You know.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:10">40:10&nbsp;</A></B> I have not hidden Your righteousness / Within My heart; / I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; / I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great / congregation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:11">40:11&nbsp;</A></B> You, O Jehovah, do not withhold / Your compassions from me; / May Your lovingkindness and Your truth / Preserve me continually.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:12">40:12&nbsp;</A></B> For evils encompass me until they cannot be counted; / My iniquities have so overtaken me / That I cannot see; / They are more numerous than the hairs of my head; / Thus my heart fails me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:13">40:13&nbsp;</A></B> Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me; / O Jehovah, hasten to help me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:14">40:14&nbsp;</A></B> May those who seek my life to destroy it / Be put to shame and confounded together; / May those who take delight in my misfortune / Be turned back and humiliated.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:15">40:15&nbsp;</A></B> May those who say to me, Aha! Aha! / Be desolate because of their shame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:16">40:16&nbsp;</A></B> May all those who seek You / Be glad and rejoice in You; / May those who love Your salvation say continually, / May Jehovah be magnified!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:17">40:17&nbsp;</A></B> But I am poor and needy; / May the Lord think about me. / You are my help and my Deliverer; / O my God, do not delay.<BR>
