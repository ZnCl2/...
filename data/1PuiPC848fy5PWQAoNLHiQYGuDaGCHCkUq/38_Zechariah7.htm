</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And in the fourth year of Darius the king the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah on the fourth <I>day</I> of the ninth month, <I>the month</I> Chislev.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Now <I>the people of</I> Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to entreat the favor of Jehovah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> By speaking to the priests who belong to the house of Jehovah of hosts and to the prophets, saying, Shall I weep in the fifth month and separate myself, as I have done these many years?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <I>months,</I> even for these seventy years, was it at all for Me that you fasted?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And when you eat and when you drink, are you not the ones eating and are you not the ones drinking?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Are not <I>these</I> the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous and <I>had</I> cities round about her, when the Negev and the lowlands were inhabited?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Judge with judgment of truth, and show lovingkindness and compassion each to his brother;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And do not oppress the widow and the orphan, the stranger and the poor; and let none of you think evil in your hearts about his brother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> But they refused to listen, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and closed their ears from hearing;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And they set their hearts like adamant so as not to hear the instruction and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And as He called and they would not hear, so they called and I would not hear, says Jehovah of hosts;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> But with a storm I scattered them away upon all the nations, whom they did not know. Thus the land is desolate behind them, so that no one passes through <I>it</I> and no one returns <I>to it;</I> for they have made the desirable land desolate.<BR>
