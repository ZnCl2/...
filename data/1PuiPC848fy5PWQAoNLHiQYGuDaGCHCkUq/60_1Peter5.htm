</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore the elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Be sober; watch. Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Him withstand, being firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished among your brotherhood in the world.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> But the God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, <I>and</I> ground <I>you</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Through Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I account <I>him,</I> I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying fully that this is the true grace of God; <I>enter</I> into this <I>grace</I> and stand <I>in it</I>.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> The co-chosen in Babylon and Mark my son greet you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ.<BR>
