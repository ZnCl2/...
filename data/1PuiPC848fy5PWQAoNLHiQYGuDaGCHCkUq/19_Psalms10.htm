</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:1">10:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Why, O Jehovah, do You stand far off? / <I>Why</I> do You hide Yourself in times of distress?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:2">10:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Arrogantly the wicked hotly pursue the poor&nbsp;— / May they be caught in the plots that they devise!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:3">10:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For the wicked man boasts of the desire of his soul, / And the rapacious man curses, <I>even</I> despises, Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:4">10:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The wicked man, according to the haughtiness of his countenance, / <I>Says,</I> He will not require <I>it;</I> / All his thoughts are <I>this:</I> There is no God!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:5">10:5 &nbsp;</A></B> His ways succeed at all times; / Your judgments are on high, out of his sight; / As for all his adversaries, he snorts at them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:6">10:6 &nbsp;</A></B> He has said in his heart, I will not be shaken; / I will be in no trouble forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:7">10:7 &nbsp;</A></B> His mouth is full of curses and of deceit and oppression; / Under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:8">10:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He sits in the ambushes of the open villages; / In hidden places he murders the innocent; / His eyes secretly watch for the unfortunate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:9">10:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He lurks in secret like a lion in <I>its</I> covert; / He lurks <I>ready</I> to seize the poor; / He seizes the poor, drawing <I>them</I> up in his net.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:10">10:10&nbsp;</A></B> He stoops, he crouches, / And the unfortunate fall by his mighty <I>claws.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:11">10:11&nbsp;</A></B> He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; / He has hidden His face; He will never see <I>this.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:12">10:12&nbsp;</A></B> Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up Your hand. / Do not forget the poor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:13">10:13&nbsp;</A></B> Why does the wicked man despise God / <I>And</I> say in his heart, You will not require <I>it?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:14">10:14&nbsp;</A></B> You do see! For You observe mischief and vexation, / To requite <I>it</I> with Your own hand. / To You the unfortunate one commits <I>his cause;</I> / You have been the help of the orphan.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:15">10:15&nbsp;</A></B> Break the arm of the wicked man and the evil doer; / Seek out his wickedness until You find no more.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:16">10:16&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah is King forever and ever; / The nations have perished from His land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:17">10:17&nbsp;</A></B> You have heard the desire of the lowly, O Jehovah; / You will establish their heart; You will cause Your ears to listen,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:18">10:18&nbsp;</A></B> In order to execute justice for the orphan and the oppressed one, / That the mortal man of the earth may terrorize no longer.<BR>
