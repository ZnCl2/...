</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion: Rejoice!<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Count <I>it</I> all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Knowing that the proving of your faith works out endurance.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And let endurance have <I>its</I> perfect work that you may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But if any one of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing, for he who doubts is like the surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed about.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For that man must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>He is</I> a double-souled man, unstable in all his ways.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And the rich in his being brought low, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass, and its flower falls off, and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich man will fade away in his pursuits.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, and He Himself tempts no one.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> But each one is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own lusts;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin; and the sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B> All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:18">&nbsp;1:18 &nbsp;</A></B> He brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:19">&nbsp;1:19 &nbsp;</A></B> You know <I>this,</I> my beloved brothers; but let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:20">&nbsp;1:20 &nbsp;</A></B> For the wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:21">&nbsp;1:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:22">&nbsp;1:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And become doers of the word and not hearers only, who delude themselves.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:23">&nbsp;1:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one is like a man considering in a mirror the face he was born with;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:24">&nbsp;1:24 &nbsp;</A></B> For he considers himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of person he is.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:25">&nbsp;1:25 &nbsp;</A></B> But he who looks into the perfect law, the <I>law</I> of freedom, and continues in <I>it,</I> becoming not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in his doing.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:26">&nbsp;1:26 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone thinks himself to be religious <I>and yet</I> does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this one’s religion is vain.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:27">&nbsp;1:27 &nbsp;</A></B> This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction <I>and</I> to keep oneself unspotted from the world.<BR>
