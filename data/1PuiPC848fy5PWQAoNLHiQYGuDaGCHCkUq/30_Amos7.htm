</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me, and there He was, forming locusts in the beginning of the springing up of the spring crop; and it was the spring crop after the king’s mowings.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And when <I>their</I> eating of the herbage of the land was complete, I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech You! How will Jacob stand, for he is small?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, says Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me, and there the Lord Jehovah was, calling to contend <I>with them</I> with fire; and it devoured the great deep, and it devoured the land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I said, O Lord Jehovah, Stop, I beseech You! How will Jacob stand, for he is small?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah repented concerning this: This also shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus He showed me, and there the Lord was, standing upon a perfectly plumbed wall; and in His hand was a plumb line.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to me, What do you see, Amos? And I said, A plumb line. And the Lord said, I am now setting a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel; I will not pass them by anymore.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And the high places of Isaac will be desolated, / And the sanctuaries of Israel will be made waste; / And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent <I>word</I> to Jeroboam the king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to endure all his words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Amos, By the sword Jeroboam will die, and Israel will surely go into captivity out from its land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Amaziah said to Amos, Go, you seer; flee into the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> But in Bethel you shall not ever prophesy again, for it is the king’s sanctuary and it is the royal residence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I am no prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; rather I am a herdsman and a dresser of sycamores.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And now hear the word of Jehovah: You say, You shall not prophesy against Israel, nor shall you speak against the house of Isaac.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah,<BR>Your wife will go about as a harlot in the city, / And your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, / And your land will be divided by the line, / And you yourself will die in a land that is unclean; / And Israel will indeed go into captivity / Out from its land.<BR>
