</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden of the word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach, / And Damascus will be its resting place / (For Jehovah has an eye on man, / Especially on the tribes of Israel),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Hamath also, <I>which</I> borders on it; / Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For Tyre built herself a stronghold / And heaped up silver like dust / And gold like the mire of the streets.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord is about to take possession of her, / And He will strike her might in the sea, / And she will be consumed with fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Ashkelon will see <I>it</I> and be afraid; / Gaza also, and it will writhe much in anguish; / And Ekron, for her expectation will have been confounded. / And the king will perish from Gaza, / And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And a mixed race will dwell in Ashdod, / And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will remove his blood from his mouth / And his detestable things from between his teeth; / And he also will remain unto our God; / And he will be like a leader in Judah, / And Ekron will be like a Jebusite.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will encamp around My house because of an army, / Because of him who passes by and returns; / And no oppressor will pass over them any more; / For now I see with My eyes.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; / Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! / Now your King comes to you. / He is righteous and bears salvation, / Lowly and riding upon a donkey, / Even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim / And the horse from Jerusalem, / And the battle bow will be cut off; / And He will speak peace unto the nations, / And His dominion will be from sea to sea / And from the River unto the ends of the earth.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> As for you also, because of the blood of your covenant, / I have released your captives from the pit, where there is no water.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Turn to the stronghold, O prisoners with hope. / This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For I will bend Judah for Myself, / And I will fill a bow with Ephraim; / And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, / Against your sons, O Javan; / And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will appear above them, / And His arrow will go forth like lightning; / And the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, / And He will go in the whirlwinds of the south.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah of hosts will defend them; / And they will devour and trample the sling stones. / And they will drink; they will be noisy as if with wine; / And they will be filled like a <I>sacrificial</I> basin, / Like the corners of the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of His people, / For <I>they will be like</I> the stones of a crown, sparkling in His land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> For how great is their goodness, and how great their beauty! / Grain will make the young men flourish, / And new wine, the virgins.<BR>
