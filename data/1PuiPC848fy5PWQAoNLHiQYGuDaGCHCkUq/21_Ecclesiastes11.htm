</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:1">11:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Cast your bread upon the surface of the waters, for you will find it in many days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:2">11:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Give a portion to seven, and even to eight, for you do not know what calamity will happen on the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:3">11:3 &nbsp;</A></B> If the clouds are full, they pour forth rain on the earth; and whether a tree falls toward the south or toward the north, in the place where it falls, there will it be.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:4">11:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He who watches the wind will not sow, and he who looks at the clouds will not reap.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:5">11:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Just as you do not know what the path of the wind is <I>or</I> how the bones <I>are</I> <I>formed</I> in the mother’s womb, so you do not know the work of God, who makes everything.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:6">11:6 &nbsp;</A></B> In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not hold back your hands; for you do not know which will prosper, this one or that, or whether both alike will be good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:7">11:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to see the sun.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:8">11:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in all of them; but let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All that comes is vanity.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:9">11:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Rejoice, young man, in your childhood, and let your heart be merry in the days of your youth; and walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:10">11:10&nbsp;</A></B> So remove vexation from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh; for childhood and the dawn of life are vanity.<BR>
