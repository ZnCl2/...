</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:1">12:1 &nbsp;</A></B> You are righteous, O Jehovah, / When I plead <I>my</I> cause with You; / Yet I will speak with You of <I>Your</I> judgments: / Why does the way of the wicked prosper? / <I>Why</I> are all those who deal treacherously at ease?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:2">12:2 &nbsp;</A></B> You have planted them; they have also taken root; / They go on and bring forth fruit. / You are near, in their mouth, / But far from their inward parts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:3">12:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And You, O Jehovah, know me; You see me / And try my heart toward You. / Pull them out like sheep for the slaying, / And set them apart for the day of slaughter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:4">12:4 &nbsp;</A></B> How long will the land mourn / And the grass of every field dry up? / Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it, / Beasts and birds are swept away, / Because they said, He will not see our end.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:5">12:5 &nbsp;</A></B> If you have run with footmen and they have wearied you, / How then will you compete with horses? / <I>If</I> you are secure in a land of peace, / How then will you do in the majesty of the Jordan?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:6">12:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For even your brothers and the house of your father, / Even they have dealt treacherously with you; / Even they have cried aloud after you. / Do not believe them, although they speak good things to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:7">12:7 &nbsp;</A></B> I have forsaken My house; / I have abandoned My inheritance; / I have given the beloved of My soul / Into the hand of her enemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:8">12:8 &nbsp;</A></B> My inheritance has become to Me / Like a lion in the forest; / She lifted up her voice against Me, / Therefore I hated her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:9">12:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Is My inheritance a speckled bird of prey to Me? / Are the birds of prey against her all around? / Go, gather all the beasts of the field; / Bring them to devour.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:10">12:10&nbsp;</A></B> Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; / They have trampled down My portion; / They have made My pleasant portion / A desolate wilderness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:11">12:11&nbsp;</A></B> They have made it a desolation; / Desolate, it mourns to Me; / The whole land has been desolated / Because no one lays it to heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:12">12:12&nbsp;</A></B> Upon all the bare heights in the wilderness / Destroyers have come, For the sword of Jehovah devours / From one end of the land to the other end of the land; / No flesh has peace.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:13">12:13&nbsp;</A></B> They have sown wheat, and they reap thorns; / They have worn themselves out, but they profit nothing; / Therefore be ashamed of your produce / Because of the burning anger of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:14">12:14&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah concerning all My evil neighbors, who have touched the inheritance which I caused My people Israel to inherit, I am about to pluck them up out of their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah out from their midst.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:15">12:15&nbsp;</A></B> And after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them and bring them again, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:16">12:16&nbsp;</A></B> And if they will diligently learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, <I>saying,</I> As Jehovah lives, even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, they will be built up in the midst of My people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:17">12:17&nbsp;</A></B> But if they do not listen, I will pluck up that nation, plucking <I>it</I> up and destroying <I>it,</I> declares Jehovah.<BR>
