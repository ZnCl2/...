</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:1">31:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I made a covenant with my eyes; / How then can I gaze upon a virgin?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:2">31:2 &nbsp;</A></B> What then is the portion from God above, / Or the inheritance of the Almighty on high?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:3">31:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Is it not calamity for the unjust / And misfortune for the workers of iniquity?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:4">31:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Does He not see my ways / And count all my steps?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:5">31:5 &nbsp;</A></B> If I have walked with falsehood, / And my foot has hastened after deceit&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:6">31:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Let Him weigh me in a righteous balance, / And let God know my integrity&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:7">31:7 &nbsp;</A></B> If my step has turned from the way, / And my heart has gone after my own eyes, / And if any spot has stuck to my hands;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:8">31:8 &nbsp;</A></B> May I sow and another eat; / Indeed may my produce be rooted up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:9">31:9 &nbsp;</A></B> If my heart has been enticed into <I>following</I> after a woman, / Or I have lain in wait at my neighbor’s door;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:10">31:10&nbsp;</A></B> May my wife grind for another, / And may others kneel over her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:11">31:11&nbsp;</A></B> For that would have been a heinous act, / And it would be wickedness, <I>to be punished</I> by the judges.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:12">31:12&nbsp;</A></B> For it is a fire that devours to Abaddon / And would root up all my increase.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:13">31:13&nbsp;</A></B> If I have despised the cause of my servant or my maid / When they contended with me,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:14">31:14&nbsp;</A></B> What then will I do when God rises up? / And when He visits me, what will I answer Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:15">31:15&nbsp;</A></B> Did not He who made me in the womb make him? / And was it not One who fashioned us in the womb?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:16">31:16&nbsp;</A></B> If I have withheld the poor from <I>their</I> desire, / Or have let the eyes of the widow fail,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:17">31:17&nbsp;</A></B> Or have eaten my morsel alone / Without the orphan eating of it&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:18">31:18&nbsp;</A></B> Rather, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, / And from my mother’s womb I guided the widow&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:19">31:19&nbsp;</A></B> If I have seen someone perishing from lack of clothing / Or that the needy had no covering;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:20">31:20&nbsp;</A></B> If his loins have not blessed me, / And he has not been made warm with the fleece of my sheep;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:21">31:21&nbsp;</A></B> If I have raised my hand against the orphan / Because I saw that I had support <I>among those</I> in the gate;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:22">31:22&nbsp;</A></B> May my shoulder blade fall from the shoulder, / And may my arm be broken at the elbow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:23">31:23&nbsp;</A></B> For calamity from God is dreadful to me, / And because of His majesty I can do nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:24">31:24&nbsp;</A></B> If I have made gold my hope, / And have called fine gold my confidence;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:25">31:25&nbsp;</A></B> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great / And because my hand had acquired much;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:26">31:26&nbsp;</A></B> If I have looked at the sun when it shone / Or the moon going on in splendor,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:27">31:27&nbsp;</A></B> And my heart has been secretly enticed, / And my mouth has kissed my hand;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:28">31:28&nbsp;</A></B> It too would be wickedness, <I>to be punished</I> by the judges, / For I would have denied God above.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:29">31:29&nbsp;</A></B> If I have rejoiced at the misfortune of him who hated me, / Or have exulted when evil found him&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:30">31:30&nbsp;</A></B> Rather, I have not allowed my mouth to sin / By asking for his life with a curse&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:31">31:31&nbsp;</A></B> If the men of my tent have not said, / Who can find one who has not been filled with our master’s meat?&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:32">31:32&nbsp;</A></B> The sojourner has not lodged in the street; / I have opened my doors to the highway&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:33">31:33&nbsp;</A></B> If I have covered my transgressions as Adam did / By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:34">31:34&nbsp;</A></B> Because I so dreaded the great multitude, / And the contempt of the families so frightened me, / That I was silent and did not go out <I>my</I> door&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:35">31:35&nbsp;</A></B> Oh, that I had someone to hear me! / Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me. / And let my accuser write up the charge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:36">31:36&nbsp;</A></B> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; / I would bind it onto me like a crown;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:37">31:37&nbsp;</A></B> I would declare to Him the number of my steps; / Like a prince I would approach Him!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:38">31:38&nbsp;</A></B> If my land cries out against me, / And its furrows weep together;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:39">31:39&nbsp;</A></B> If I have eaten its strength without money, / And have caused its owners to lose <I>their</I> life;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:40">31:40&nbsp;</A></B> May thorns come forth instead of wheat, / And pungent weeds instead of barley. / The words of Job are ended.<BR>
