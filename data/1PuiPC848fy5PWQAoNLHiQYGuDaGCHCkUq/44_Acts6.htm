</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And in these days, as the disciples were multiplying <I>in number,</I> a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews occurred, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily dispensing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to <I>them</I> and said, It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And the word pleased all the multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly; and a large number of the priests obeyed the faith.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But some of those of the synagogue which is called the <I>synagogue</I> of the Libertines and of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and Asia rose up and disputed with Stephen;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Then they instigated some men to say, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon <I>him</I> and seized him and led <I>him</I> to the Sanhedrin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And they set up false witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words against this holy place and the law,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And all those sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw his face as though <I>it were</I> the face of an angel.<BR>
