</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:1">43:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But now thus says Jehovah / Who created you, O Jacob, and who formed you, O Israel: / Do not fear, because I have redeemed you; / I have called <I>you</I> by your name; you are Mine.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:2">43:2 &nbsp;</A></B> When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, / And through the rivers, they will not flow over you. / And when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned, / And the flame will not consume you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:3">43:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Because I am Jehovah your God, / The Holy One of Israel, your Savior, / I have given Egypt as your ransom, / Cush and Seba instead of you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:4">43:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Since you were precious in My eyes, / <I>Since</I> you have been honorable and I have loved you, / I will give up men in your place, / And peoples in exchange for your life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:5">43:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not fear, because I am with you; / I will bring your seed from the east, / And gather you from the west.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:6">43:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I will say to the north, Give <I>them</I> up, / And to the south, Do not keep <I>them</I> back. / Bring My sons from afar, / And My daughters from the end of the earth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:7">43:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Everyone who is called by My name, / Whom I have created, formed, and even made for My glory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:8">43:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Bring out the people who are blind yet have eyes, / And those who are deaf yet have ears.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:9">43:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Let all the nations be gathered together, / And let the peoples assemble. / Who among them can declare this / And relate to us the former things? / Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified, / And let them hear and say, <I>It is</I> true.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:10">43:10&nbsp;</A></B> You are My witnesses, declares Jehovah, / And My servant whom I have chosen, / In order that you may know and believe Me / And understand that I am He. / Before Me there was no God formed, / Neither will there be any after Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:11">43:11&nbsp;</A></B> I, <I>even</I> I, am Jehovah; / And there is no Savior besides Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:12">43:12&nbsp;</A></B> I have declared, and I have saved, and I have let <I>them</I> hear; / There is no strange <I>god</I> among you. / And you are My witnesses, declares Jehovah, / And I am God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:13">43:13&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, before the day <I>was,</I> I am He, / And there is no one who can deliver from My hand. / I will work and who will reverse it?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:14">43:14&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / Your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, / For your sake I have sent to Babylon, / And I will bring down all of them as fugitives, / Even the Chaldeans, whose rejoicing is in the ships.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:15">43:15&nbsp;</A></B> I am Jehovah, your Holy One, / The Creator of Israel, your King.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:16">43:16&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / Who has made a way in the sea, / And a path in the mighty waters,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:17">43:17&nbsp;</A></B> Who brings forth the chariot and the horse, / The army and the powerful together. / They will lie down, they will not rise; / They are extinct, they are quenched like flax.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:18">43:18&nbsp;</A></B> Do not call to mind the former things, / Nor consider the things of old.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:19">43:19&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I am doing a new thing; / It will now spring forth; / Do you not know it? / I will even make a way in the wilderness, / Rivers in the desert.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:20">43:20&nbsp;</A></B> The animals of the field will honor Me, / The jackals and the ostriches, / Because I have given <I>them</I> water in the wilderness, / Rivers in the desert, / To give a drink to My people, My chosen ones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:21">43:21&nbsp;</A></B> This people I have formed for Myself; / They will show forth My praise.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:22">43:22&nbsp;</A></B> But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob, / But you have grown weary of Me, O Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:23">43:23&nbsp;</A></B> You have not brought Me a sheep for your burnt offerings, / And you have not honored Me with your sacrifices; / I have not made you serve <I>Me</I> with a meal offering, / Nor wearied you with incense.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:24">43:24&nbsp;</A></B> You did not buy calamus for Me with money, / And you did not fill Me with the fat of your sacrifices. / Indeed, you have burdened Me with your sins; / You have wearied Me with your iniquities.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:25">43:25&nbsp;</A></B> I, <I>even</I> I, am He who wipes away your transgressions for My own sake, / And I will not remember your sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:26">43:26&nbsp;</A></B> Put Me in remembrance; let us plead <I>in judgment</I> together: / Declare <I>your case</I> that you may be justified.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:27">43:27&nbsp;</A></B> Your first father sinned, / And your mediators transgressed against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="43:28">43:28&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I profaned the princes of the sanctuary, / And I delivered up Jacob to destruction, / And Israel to reviling.<BR>
