</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who are at ease in Zion / And to those who are secure in the mountain of Samaria, / The distinguished among the chief of the nations, / To whom the house of Israel comes!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Go over into Calneh, and see; / And go from there to Hamath the great; / Then go down to Gath of the Philistines. / Are they better than these kingdoms? / Or is their territory greater than your territory?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> You who thrust away the evil day / And cause the seat of violence to draw near,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> You who lie upon beds of ivory / And sprawl out upon your couches / And eat the lambs from the flock / And the calves from the midst of the stall,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> You who prattle to the tune of the harp, / Who make for yourselves instruments of song like David,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> You who drink wine in sacrificial bowls / And anoint yourselves with the finest oils; / Yet you are not grieved about the destruction of Joseph.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore they will now go into captivity with the first of the captives, / And the cry of revelry from those who sprawled themselves out will pass / away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, / Declares Jehovah the God of hosts, / I abhor the pride of Jacob, / And his palaces I hate; / Therefore I will deliver up the city and its fullness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And if ten men remain in one house, they will die.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> When his kinsman, that is, he who should burn <I>his body,</I> takes him up to bring <I>his</I> bones from the house, and says to him who is in the innermost part of the house, Are there any more with you, and <I>that one</I> says, None; then he will say, Hush, for the name of Jehovah should not be mentioned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For it is Jehovah who commands, / And He will strike the great house into fragments / And the little house into pieces.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Do horses run on rock? / Or does one plow <I>there</I> with oxen? / But you have turned justice into poison, / And the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> You who rejoice in that which is nothing, / You who say, Have we not taken / By our own strength horns for ourselves?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For I am about to raise up a nation over you, / O house of Israel, declares Jehovah the God of hosts, / And they will oppress you / From the entrance of Hamath / To the brook of the Arabah.<BR>
