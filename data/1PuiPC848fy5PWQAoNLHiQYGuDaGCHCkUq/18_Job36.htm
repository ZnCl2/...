</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:1">36:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And Elihu added <I>this</I> and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:2">36:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Bear with me a little, and I will show you; / For there is more to say for God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:3">36:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I will bring my knowledge from afar / And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:4">36:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For truly my words are not false; / One perfect in knowledge is with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:5">36:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, God is mighty and does not despise; / <I>He is</I> mighty in strength of understanding.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:6">36:6 &nbsp;</A></B> He does not preserve the wicked man alive, / But gives justice to the afflicted.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:7">36:7 &nbsp;</A></B> He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; / And with kings on the throne, / He sets them forever, and they are exalted.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:8">36:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And if they are bound in fetters, / If they are caught in the cords of affliction,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:9">36:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He shows them their work / And their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:10">36:10&nbsp;</A></B> He also opens their ear to instruction / And commands that they return from iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:11">36:11&nbsp;</A></B> If they hear and serve <I>Him,</I> / They will spend their days in prosperity / And their years in pleasantness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:12">36:12&nbsp;</A></B> But if they do not hear, they will pass away by the sword / And die without knowledge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:13">36:13&nbsp;</A></B> But those who are profane in heart lay up anger; / They do not cry for help when He binds them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:14">36:14&nbsp;</A></B> They die in youth, / And their life <I>ends</I> among the most defiled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:15">36:15&nbsp;</A></B> He rescues the afflicted by their affliction / And opens their ear through oppression.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:16">36:16&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress / Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint; / And what is upon your table is full of fatness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:17">36:17&nbsp;</A></B> But you are filled with the judgment of the wicked; / Judgment and litigation have taken hold <I>of you.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:18">36:18&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Beware</I> lest wrath allures you into scoffing, / And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:19">36:19&nbsp;</A></B> Will your cry keep <I>you</I> from being in distress, / Or all the forces of <I>your</I> strength?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:20">36:20&nbsp;</A></B> Do not long for the night, / When people are taken from their place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:21">36:21&nbsp;</A></B> Take heed; do not turn toward iniquity; / For you have chosen this rather than affliction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:22">36:22&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, God is exalted in His power: / Who is a teacher like Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:23">36:23&nbsp;</A></B> Who has appointed His way for Him? / And who says, You have done wrong?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:24">36:24&nbsp;</A></B> Remember to magnify His work, / Of which men sing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:25">36:25&nbsp;</A></B> All mankind has gazed on it; / Man beholds <I>it</I> from afar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:26">36:26&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, God is great, and we do not know <I>Him;</I> / The number of His years we also cannot search out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:27">36:27&nbsp;</A></B> For He draws up the drops of water / Which distill into rain from His mist,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:28">36:28&nbsp;</A></B> Which the skies pour down / <I>And</I> drop upon man abundantly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:29">36:29&nbsp;</A></B> Can they indeed understand the spreading of the clouds, / The thunderings of His pavilion?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:30">36:30&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, He scatters His lightning around Him / And covers the roots of the sea.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:31">36:31&nbsp;</A></B> For by these He judges the peoples; / He gives food in abundance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:32">36:32&nbsp;</A></B> He fills <I>His</I> hands with lightning / And commands it to strike the mark.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:33">36:33&nbsp;</A></B> Its noise tells of Him; / The cattle as well <I>tell</I> concerning Him who is coming.<BR>
