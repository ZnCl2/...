</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:2">106:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, / <I>Or</I> declare all His praise?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:3">106:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Blessed are those who maintain justice, / Who execute righteousness at all times.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:4">106:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember me, O Jehovah, with <I>Your</I> favor toward Your people; / Visit me with Your salvation,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:5">106:5 &nbsp;</A></B> That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, / That I may rejoice in the joy of Your nation, / That I may glory with Your inheritance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:6">106:6 &nbsp;</A></B> We have sinned with our fathers; / We committed iniquity; we have acted wickedly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:7">106:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Our fathers in Egypt / Did not understand Your wonders; / They did not remember the multitude of Your acts of lovingkindness, / But rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:8">106:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But He saved them for His name’s sake, / That He might make His power known.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:9">106:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; / And He led them through the depths as through the wilderness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:10">106:10&nbsp;</A></B> And He saved them from the hand of him who hated <I>them,</I> / And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:11">106:11&nbsp;</A></B> The water then covered their adversaries; / Not one of them was left.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:12">106:12&nbsp;</A></B> Then they believed His words; / They sang His praise.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:13">106:13&nbsp;</A></B> Soon they forgot His works; / They did not wait for His counsel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:14">106:14&nbsp;</A></B> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, / And tempted God in the desert.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:15">106:15&nbsp;</A></B> And He gave them their request, / But He sent leanness into their soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:16">106:16&nbsp;</A></B> And they were jealous of Moses in the camp / <I>And</I> of Aaron, the holy one of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:17">106:17&nbsp;</A></B> The earth opened, and it swallowed up Dathan / And covered the company of Abiram.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:18">106:18&nbsp;</A></B> And a fire burned among their company; / A flame engulfed the wicked.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:19">106:19&nbsp;</A></B> They made a calf in Horeb, / And worshipped a molten image.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:20">106:20&nbsp;</A></B> Thus they exchanged their glory / For the image of an ox that eats grass.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:21">106:21&nbsp;</A></B> They forgot God their Savior, / Who had done great things in Egypt,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:22">106:22&nbsp;</A></B> Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, / Awesome things by the Red Sea.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:23">106:23&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore He said that He would destroy them, / <I>And would have,</I> had not Moses His chosen one / Stood in the breach before Him / To turn away His wrath from destroying <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:24">106:24&nbsp;</A></B> Then they despised the pleasant land; / They did not believe in His word;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:25">106:25&nbsp;</A></B> Rather they murmured in their tents; / They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:26">106:26&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore He lifted up His hand <I>and swore</I> to them / That He would make them fall in the wilderness,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:27">106:27&nbsp;</A></B> And that He would make their seed fall among the nations, / And that He would disperse them among the lands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:28">106:28&nbsp;</A></B> Then they joined themselves to Baal-peor, / And ate sacrifices <I>offered</I> to the dead.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:29">106:29&nbsp;</A></B> Thus they provoked <I>Him</I> to anger by their actions, / And the plague broke out among them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:30">106:30&nbsp;</A></B> Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, / And the plague was stayed;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:31">106:31&nbsp;</A></B> And it has been accounted to him as righteousness / From generation to generation unto eternity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:32">106:32&nbsp;</A></B> Then they angered <I>Him</I> at the waters of Meribah, / So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:33">106:33&nbsp;</A></B> For they rebelled against His Spirit, / And he spoke rashly with his lips.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:34">106:34&nbsp;</A></B> They did not destroy the peoples, / As Jehovah had commanded them;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:35">106:35&nbsp;</A></B> But they mingled themselves with the nations / And learned their practices.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:36">106:36&nbsp;</A></B> And they served their idols, / Which became a snare to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:37">106:37&nbsp;</A></B> They also sacrificed their sons / And their daughters to demons,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:38">106:38&nbsp;</A></B> And poured out innocent blood, / The blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols / of Canaan; / And the land was polluted with bloodshed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:39">106:39&nbsp;</A></B> Thus they were defiled by their practices, / And went about as harlots by their actions.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:40">106:40&nbsp;</A></B> And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against His people, / And He abhorred His inheritance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:41">106:41&nbsp;</A></B> And He gave them over into the hand of the nations: / And those who hated them ruled over them,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:42">106:42&nbsp;</A></B> And their enemies oppressed them, / And they were subdued under their hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:43">106:43&nbsp;</A></B> Many times He delivered them, / But they were rebellious in their counsel, / And they were brought low in their iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:44">106:44&nbsp;</A></B> Yet He regarded their distress / When He heard their cry,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:45">106:45&nbsp;</A></B> And for their sake He remembered His covenant, / And repented according to the multitude of His acts of lovingkindness;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:46">106:46&nbsp;</A></B> And He caused them to find compassion / With all their captors.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:47">106:47&nbsp;</A></B> Save us, O Jehovah our God; / And gather us out of the nations, / That we may give thanks to Your holy name, / That we may glory in Your praise.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="106:48">106:48&nbsp;</A></B> Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, / From eternity to eternity. / And let all the people say, Amen. / Hallelujah.<BR>
