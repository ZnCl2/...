</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:1">31:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help; / They rely on horses / And trust in chariots because they are many / And in horsemen because they are very strong; / But they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, / Nor seek Jehovah!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:2">31:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But He also is wise and will bring ill <I>upon them;</I> / And He does not turn back His words, / But will rise up against the house of evildoers / And against the help of the workers of iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:3">31:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The Egyptians are <I>mere</I> men and not God, / And their horses are <I>mere</I> flesh and not spirit; / Thus Jehovah will stretch out His hand, / And he who helps will stumble and he who is helped will fall, / And all of them will be consumed together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:4">31:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah has spoken thus to me, / As the lion or the lion cub / Roars over its prey / <I>And</I> because of it a crowd of shepherds / Is called out, / <I>But</I> it is not frightened by their voice, / Nor overcome by their noise; / So Jehovah of hosts will descend / To wage war on Mount Zion and on its hill.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:5">31:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Like flying birds / So Jehovah of hosts will protect Jerusalem; / He will protect and deliver <I>it;</I> / He will pass over and rescue <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:6">31:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Return to Him from whom <I>men</I> have deeply revolted, O children of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:7">31:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For in that day each man will cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you as a sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:8">31:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the Assyrian will fall by the sword not of a man, / And the sword not of man will devour him. / Thus he will flee from a sword, / And his young men will be forced into labor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:9">31:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And his rock will pass away in terror, / And his princes will be dismayed by the standard, / Declares Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion / And whose furnace is in Jerusalem.<BR>
