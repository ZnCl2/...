</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Seraphim hovered over Him, each having six wings: With two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And one called to the other, saying:<BR>
Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts; / The whole earth is filled with His glory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And the foundations of the threshold shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I said,<BR>
Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell; / Yet my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Then one of the seraphim flew to me with an ember in his hand, <I>which</I> he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And he touched my mouth <I>with it</I> and said,<BR>
Now that this has touched your lips, / Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us? And I said, Here am I; send me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to me, Go and say to this people,<BR>
Hear indeed, but do not perceive; / And see indeed, but do not understand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Make the heart of this people numb; / Dull their ears, / And seal their eyes; / Lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, / And their heart perceive and return, and they are healed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And I said, For how long, Lord? And He said,<BR>
Until cities lie devastated, / Without inhabitants, / And houses are without people, / And the land is devastated <I>and</I> a waste;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah has sent men far away <I>from it,</I> / And desolate places abound in the midst of the land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> But there will still be a tenth part in it; / And it in turn is to be burned / Like a terebinth or an oak, / Whose stump remains after its felling; / Its stump will be a holy seed.<BR>
