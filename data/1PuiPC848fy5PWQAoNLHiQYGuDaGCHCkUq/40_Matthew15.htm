</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:1">15:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:2">15:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:3">15:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:4">15:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For God said, “Honor your father and your mother,” and, “He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:5">15:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But you say, Whoever says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is <I>now</I> a gift <I>to God,</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:6">15:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Shall by no means honor his father or his mother; and you have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:7">15:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Hypocrites! Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:8">15:8 &nbsp;</A></B> “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:9">15:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:10">15:10&nbsp;</A></B> And He called the crowd to <I>Him</I> and said to them, Hear and understand:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:11">15:11&nbsp;</A></B> <I>It is</I> not that which enters into the mouth <I>that</I> defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:12">15:12&nbsp;</A></B> Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:13">15:13&nbsp;</A></B> And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:14">15:14&nbsp;</A></B> Let them be. They are blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:15">15:15&nbsp;</A></B> And Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:16">15:16&nbsp;</A></B> And He said, Are you also still without understanding?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:17">15:17&nbsp;</A></B> Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the drain?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:18">15:18&nbsp;</A></B> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:19">15:19&nbsp;</A></B> For out of the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:20">15:20&nbsp;</A></B> These are the things which defile the man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:21">15:21&nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:22">15:22&nbsp;</A></B> And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:23">15:23&nbsp;</A></B> But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:24">15:24&nbsp;</A></B> But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:25">15:25&nbsp;</A></B> But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:26">15:26&nbsp;</A></B> But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw <I>it</I> to the little dogs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:27">15:27&nbsp;</A></B> And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:28">15:28&nbsp;</A></B> Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:29">15:29&nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus departed from there and came beside the Sea of Galilee; and He went up to the mountain and sat there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:30">15:30&nbsp;</A></B> And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the dumb, and many other <I>sick ones;</I> and they laid them at His feet, and He healed them,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:31">15:31&nbsp;</A></B> So that the crowd marveled, because they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled healthy and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:32">15:32&nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus called His disciples to <I>Him</I> and said, I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:33">15:33&nbsp;</A></B> And the disciples said to Him, Where <I>can</I> we <I>get</I> so many loaves in <I>this</I> desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:34">15:34&nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:35">15:35&nbsp;</A></B> And after He commanded the crowd to recline on the ground,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:36">15:36&nbsp;</A></B> He took the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks, He broke <I>them</I> and gave <I>them</I> to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:37">15:37&nbsp;</A></B> And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:38">15:38&nbsp;</A></B> And those who ate were four thousand men, apart from women and children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:39">15:39&nbsp;</A></B> And after He sent the crowds away, He stepped into the boat and came to the borders of Magadan.<BR>
