</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:1">35:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Elihu continued and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:2">35:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Do you consider this to be just? / Do you say, My righteousness is more than God’s,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:3">35:3 &nbsp;</A></B> So that you say, What advantage is there to me, / What do I profit, more than if I had sinned?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:4">35:4 &nbsp;</A></B> I will respond to you with words, / And to your companions with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:5">35:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Look unto heaven and see; / And behold the skies: They are higher than you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:6">35:6 &nbsp;</A></B> If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? / And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:7">35:7 &nbsp;</A></B> If you are righteous, what can you give to Him, / Or what does He receive from your hand?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:8">35:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Your wickedness <I>affects</I> a man like you, / And your righteousness, a son of man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:9">35:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; / They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:10">35:10&nbsp;</A></B> But no one says, Where is God my Maker, / Who gives songs in the night,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:11">35:11&nbsp;</A></B> Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth / And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:12">35:12&nbsp;</A></B> There they cry, but He does not answer, / Because of the pride of evil men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:13">35:13&nbsp;</A></B> Surely God does not hear an empty <I>cry,</I> / And the Almighty does not regard it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:14">35:14&nbsp;</A></B> How much less when you say that you do not behold Him, / That the cause is before Him and you are waiting on Him!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:15">35:15&nbsp;</A></B> But now, because He has not visited <I>in</I> His anger / Nor regarded such great arrogance,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:16">35:16&nbsp;</A></B> Job opens his mouth in vanity; / He multiplies words without knowledge.<BR>
