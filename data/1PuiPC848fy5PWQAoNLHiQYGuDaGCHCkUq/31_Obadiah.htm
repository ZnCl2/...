</P><B><A NAME="1"><P class="verse">1 &nbsp;</A></B> The vision of Obadiah.<BR>

Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom, / We have heard a report from Jehovah, / And an envoy has been sent among the nations: / Arise, and let us rise up against it for battle.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="2"><P class="verse">2 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed I have made you small among the nations; / You are very despised.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="3"><P class="verse">3 &nbsp;</A></B> The arrogance of your heart has beguiled you, / O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, / Whose habitation is lofty, / Who says in his heart, / Who will bring me down to the ground?<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="4"><P class="verse">4 &nbsp;</A></B> Though you set yourself on high like the eagle / And though you make your nest among the stars, / I will bring you down from there, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="5"><P class="verse">5 &nbsp;</A></B> If thieves came to you, / If spoilers in the night&nbsp;— / How you would be cut off!&nbsp;— / Would they not steal <I>only</I> their fill? / If grape gatherers came to you, / Would they not leave gleanings?<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="6"><P class="verse">6 &nbsp;</A></B> How thoroughly searched Esau is! / <I>How</I> sought out his hidden treasures are!<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="7"><P class="verse">7 &nbsp;</A></B> All the men of your confederacy / Have sent you away to the border; / The men who were at peace with you / Have deceived you; they have prevailed against you. / They make your bread / A snare under you. / There is no understanding in him.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="8"><P class="verse">8 &nbsp;</A></B> Will I not in that day, / Declares Jehovah, / Destroy the wise men from Edom, / And understanding from the mountain of Esau?<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="9"><P class="verse">9 &nbsp;</A></B> And your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman, / So that each one is cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.<BR>

</P><B><A NAME="10"><P class="verse">10&nbsp;</A></B> Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, / Shame will cover you, and you will be cut off forever.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="11"><P class="verse">11&nbsp;</A></B> In the day that you stood on the side, / In the day that strangers took his substance captive / And foreigners entered into his gates / And cast lots over Jerusalem, / You also were like one of them.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="12"><P class="verse">12&nbsp;</A></B> But do not look to the day of your brother, / To the day of his misfortune; / Neither rejoice concerning the children of Judah / In the day of their destruction, / Nor boast / In the day of distress.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="13"><P class="verse">13&nbsp;</A></B> Do not enter the gate of My people / In the day of their calamity; / Do not look, even you, on his affliction / In the day of his calamity, / Nor send forth <I>your hands</I> on his substance / In the day of his calamity.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="14"><P class="verse">14&nbsp;</A></B> And do not stand at the crossroads / To cut off those of his who escape, / Nor deliver those of his who survive / In the day of distress.<BR>

</P><B><A NAME="15"><P class="verse">15&nbsp;</A></B> For the day of Jehovah is near / Upon all the nations: / As you have done, it will be done to you; / Your recompense will return upon your head.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="16"><P class="verse">16&nbsp;</A></B> For as you have drunk <I>the cup of wrath</I> upon My holy mountain, / All the nations will drink <I>the same</I> continually; / Indeed they will drink and swallow down, / And they will be as though they had not been.<BR>

</P><B><A NAME="17"><P class="verse">17&nbsp;</A></B> But in Mount Zion / There will be those who have escaped, / And it will be holy. / And the house of Jacob will possess / Their possessions.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="18"><P class="verse">18&nbsp;</A></B> And the house of Jacob will be a fire, / And the house of Joseph a flame; / And the house of Esau will be as stubble, / And they will burn among them and devour them; / And there will be no survivor / To the house of Esau, / For Jehovah has spoken.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="19"><P class="verse">19&nbsp;</A></B> And those of the south will possess the mountain of Esau, / And those of the lowlands, the Philistines; / Indeed they will possess the field of Ephraim / And the field of Samaria, / And Benjamin <I>will possess</I> Gilead.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="20"><P class="verse">20&nbsp;</A></B> And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel, / Who are among the Canaanites, <I>will possess</I> as far as Zarephath; / And the captivity of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad, / Will possess the cities of the south.<BR>
</P><B><A NAME="21"><P class="verse">21&nbsp;</A></B> And saviors will come up on Mount Zion / To judge the mountain of Esau, / And the kingdom will be Jehovah’s.<BR>
