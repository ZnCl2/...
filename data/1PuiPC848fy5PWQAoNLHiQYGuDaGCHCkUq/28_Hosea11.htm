</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:1">11:1 &nbsp;</A></B> When Israel was a child, I loved him, / And out of Egypt I called My son.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:2">11:2 &nbsp;</A></B> As they called them, / So they went from them; / To the Baals they sacrificed, / And to the idols they burned incense.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:3">11:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And it was I who taught Ephraim to walk / (He took them in His arms), / But they did not know that I healed them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:4">11:4 &nbsp;</A></B> I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love;<BR>
And I was to them like those / Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; / And I gently caused them to eat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:5">11:5 &nbsp;</A></B> They will not return to the land of Egypt, / But the Assyrian will be their king, / For they refused to return <I>to Me.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:6">11:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And the sword will whirl about in their cities / And will consume their bars, / And it will devour <I>them</I> because of their own counsels.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:7">11:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed My people are bent upon turning away from Me; / Though they call them to <I>Him who is</I> on high, / None at all exalts <I>Him.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:8">11:8 &nbsp;</A></B> How shall I give you up, O Ephraim? / <I>How</I> shall I deliver you up, O Israel? / How can I make you like Admah? / <I>How</I> can I treat you like Zeboim? / My heart is turned within Me; / All My compassions have warmed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:9">11:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; / I will not return to destroy Ephraim; / For I am God and not man, / The Holy One in the midst of you, / And I will not come in wrath.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:10">11:10&nbsp;</A></B> They will walk after Jehovah; / He will roar like a lion. / For He will roar, / And the children will come trembling from the west.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:11">11:11&nbsp;</A></B> They will come trembling like a bird from Egypt / And like a dove from the land of Assyria. / And I will cause them to dwell in their houses, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:12">11:12&nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim encompasses Me with lies, / And the house of Israel, with deceit; / And Judah is yet unsteadfast with God / And with the Holy One, the Faithful One.<BR>
