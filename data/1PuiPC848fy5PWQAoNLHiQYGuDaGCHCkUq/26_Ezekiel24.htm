</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:1">24:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth <I>day</I> of the month, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:2">24:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:3">24:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah,<BR>
Put on a pot&nbsp;— put <I>it</I> on; / And also pour water into it;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:4">24:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Gather into it its pieces, / Every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; / Fill <I>it</I> with choice bones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:5">24:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Take the choice of the flock, / And also <I>put</I> a pile of wood under it; / Bring it to a vigorous boil; / Indeed let its bones be boiled in it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:6">24:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the bloody city, to the pot in which there is rust and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take <I>its pieces</I> out of it piece by piece; no lot has fallen upon it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:7">24:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For her blood was within her; she put it on a bare rock; she did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:8">24:8 &nbsp;</A></B> In order to stir up wrath, to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon a bare rock, so that it might not be covered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:9">24:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the bloody city! I will also make the pile great.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:10">24:10&nbsp;</A></B> Heap on the wood, light the fire, boil the meat well, and mix in spices, and let the bones be burned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:11">24:11&nbsp;</A></B> Then stand it empty upon its coals, so that it may get hot and its bronze may glow, so that its filthiness may be burned away in it <I>and</I> its rust may be consumed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:12">24:12&nbsp;</A></B> She has wearied <I>herself</I> with toil, yet her great rust has not gone out of her. <I>Let</I> her rust <I>be</I> in the fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:13">24:13&nbsp;</A></B> Because of your lewd filthiness&nbsp;— because I tried to cleanse you, but you did not get clean, you shall not be cleansed from your filthiness anymore, until I have caused My wrath toward you to rest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:14">24:14&nbsp;</A></B> I, Jehovah, have spoken. <I>The time</I> is coming, and I will do <I>it;</I> I will not refrain, nor will I spare, nor will I repent. According to your ways and according to your doings I will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:15">24:15&nbsp;</A></B> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:16">24:16&nbsp;</A></B> Son of man, I am about to take away the delight of your eyes from you with a blow. Yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:17">24:17&nbsp;</A></B> Groan silently; make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban upon you, and put your sandals upon your feet, and do not cover <I>your</I> lips, and do not eat the bread of men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:18">24:18&nbsp;</A></B> So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:19">24:19&nbsp;</A></B> And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things you are doing <I>signify</I> to us?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:20">24:20&nbsp;</A></B> So I said to them, The word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:21">24:21&nbsp;</A></B> Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, and that which your soul longs after; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:22">24:22&nbsp;</A></B> And you will do as I have done; you shall not cover <I>your</I> lips, nor shall you eat the bread of men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:23">24:23&nbsp;</A></B> And your turbans shall be upon your heads, and your sandals, upon your feet; you shall not mourn nor weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan one to another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:24">24:24&nbsp;</A></B> Thus Ezekiel will be a sign to you. You shall do just as all he has done. And when it comes, you will know that I am the Lord Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:25">24:25&nbsp;</A></B> As for you, son of man, surely on the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and what they have set their heart on, their sons and their daughters,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:26">24:26&nbsp;</A></B> On that day one who has escaped will come to you to report <I>it</I> in your ears.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:27">24:27&nbsp;</A></B> On that day your mouth will be opened to the one who has escaped, and you shall speak and no longer be dumb. So you shall become a sign to them, and they will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
