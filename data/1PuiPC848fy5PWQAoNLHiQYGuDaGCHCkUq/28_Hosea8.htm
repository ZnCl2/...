</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:1">&nbsp;8:1 &nbsp;</A></B> A trumpet to your lips! / Like an eagle <I>he comes</I> against the house of Jehovah, / Because they have trespassed My covenant / And have transgressed against My law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:2">&nbsp;8:2 &nbsp;</A></B> They will cry unto Me, / My God, we&nbsp;— Israel&nbsp;— know You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:3">&nbsp;8:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Israel has cast off what is good; / The enemy will pursue him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:4">&nbsp;8:4 &nbsp;</A></B> They have set up kings, but not by Me; / They have set up princes, but I did not acknowledge <I>it.</I> / With their silver and their gold they made / Idols for themselves, / That they might be cut off.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:5">&nbsp;8:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Your calf has cast <I>you</I> off, O Samaria; / My anger burns against them. / How long will they be incapable of innocence?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:6">&nbsp;8:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For from Israel is this! / A workman made it; / Thus it is no God. / The calf of Samaria / Will be <I>shattered to</I> pieces.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:7">&nbsp;8:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For they have sown wind, / And they will reap a whirlwind. / It has no stalk; <I>should there be</I> a sprout, / It will not produce flour; / If it should produce, / Strangers will swallow it up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:8">&nbsp;8:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Israel has been swallowed up; / Now they have become among the nations / Like a vessel in which no one takes pleasure.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:9">&nbsp;8:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For they have gone up to Assyria / <I>Like</I> a wild ass gone alone by itself; / Ephraim has hired lovers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:10">&nbsp;8:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed though they have hired <I>such</I> among the nations, / I will now gather them; / And they will begin to be diminished because of the burden / Of the king of the princes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:11">&nbsp;8:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, / Altars will be to him for sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:12">&nbsp;8:12 &nbsp;</A></B> I wrote for him the ten thousand things of My law, / <I>But</I> they are considered as a strange thing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:13">&nbsp;8:13 &nbsp;</A></B> As for the sacrifices of My offerings, / They sacrifice flesh and eat <I>it,</I> / <I>But</I> Jehovah has no delight in them. / Now He will remember their iniquity, / And He will punish their sins; / They will return to Egypt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:14">&nbsp;8:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For Israel has forgotten his Maker / And has built palaces, / And Judah has multiplied fortified cities; / But I will send fire into his cities, / And it will devour its citadels.<BR>
