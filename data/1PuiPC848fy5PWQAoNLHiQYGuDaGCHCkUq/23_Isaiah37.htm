</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:1">37:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And when King Hezekiah heard, he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:2">37:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, who had covered themselves in sackcloth, to Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:3">37:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of affliction, rebuke, and contempt, for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring <I>them</I> forth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:4">37:4 &nbsp;</A></B> It may be that Jehovah your God will hear the words of the Rab-shakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Jehovah your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant which is left.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:5">37:5 &nbsp;</A></B> So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:6">37:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Isaiah said to them, Thus you shall say to your master, Thus says Jehovah, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:7">37:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed I will put a spirit in him, so that he will hear a report and return to his land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:8">37:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the Rab-shakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, because he had heard that <I>the king</I> had departed from Lachish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:9">37:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And he heard <I>a report</I> about Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia which said, He has come forth to make war with you. And when he heard <I>it,</I> he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:10">37:10&nbsp;</A></B> In this way you shall speak to Hezekiah the king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:11">37:11&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them utterly. And will you be delivered?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:12">37:12&nbsp;</A></B> Have the gods of the nations, whom my fathers destroyed, delivered them: Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden, who were in Telassar?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:13">37:13&nbsp;</A></B> Where are the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:15">37:15&nbsp;</A></B> And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:16">37:16&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, You who are enthroned <I>between</I> the cherubim, You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth; You made the heavens and the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:17">37:17&nbsp;</A></B> Incline Your ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open Your eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent <I>messengers</I> to reproach the living God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:18">37:18&nbsp;</A></B> Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries and their land,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:19">37:19&nbsp;</A></B> And have cast their gods into the fire, because they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; so they destroyed them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:20">37:20&nbsp;</A></B> And now, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:21">37:21&nbsp;</A></B> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent <I>a message</I> to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyria,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:22">37:22&nbsp;</A></B> This is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him:<BR>
The virgin daughter of Zion / Has despised you <I>and</I> laughed at you; / The daughter of Jerusalem / Has shaken <I>her</I> head behind you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:23">37:23&nbsp;</A></B> Whom have you reproached and reviled? / Against whom have you lifted up <I>your</I> voice / And lifted up your eyes haughtily? / Against the Holy One of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:24">37:24&nbsp;</A></B> By your servants you have reproached the Lord, / And you have said, In the multitude of my chariots, / I have come up to the heights of the mountains, / To the sides of Lebanon. / And I will cut down its tall cedars, / <I>And</I> the choicest of its cypresses: / I will enter into its farthest height / <I>And</I> its luxuriant forest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:25">37:25&nbsp;</A></B> I have dug; / I have drunk water; / With the sole of my foot I have dried up / All the rivers of Egypt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:26">37:26&nbsp;</A></B> Have you not heard / <I>That</I> long ago I did it; / And from the days of old I had formed it? / Now I have brought it to pass, / That <I>you</I> should destroy fortified cities, / <I>And make them into</I> ruinous heaps.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:27">37:27&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength; / They were dismayed and felt ashamed; / And they were <I>like</I> vegetation of the field / And green shoots of tender grass, / <I>Like</I> grass <I>which grows</I> on the housetops / And is scorched before it has grown up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:28">37:28&nbsp;</A></B> But I know your sitting down, / And your going out and your coming in, / And your raging against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:29">37:29&nbsp;</A></B> Because your raging against Me / And your arrogance has come up into My ears, / I will put My hook in your nose / And My bridle in your lips, / And turn you back on the way by which you came.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:30">37:30&nbsp;</A></B> This shall be the sign to you: This year you shall eat that which grows up of itself, and the second year that which shoots up from the same, and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:31">37:31&nbsp;</A></B> And the remnant of those who have escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:32">37:32&nbsp;</A></B> For a remnant will go forth out of Jerusalem, and from Mount Zion those who have escaped. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:33">37:33&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore, thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria,<BR>
He shall not come to this city, / Nor shoot an arrow there; / Neither shall he come against it with shields, / And build up a mound against it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:34">37:34&nbsp;</A></B> By the way on which he came, / By the same shall he return, / And into this city he shall not come, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:35">37:35&nbsp;</A></B> And around this city I will put an enclosure / To save it, / For My own sake / And for the sake of David, My servant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:36">37:36&nbsp;</A></B> Then the angel of Jehovah went out and struck the Assyrians’ camp, a hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when they arose early in the morning, all of them were corpses, dead.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:37">37:37&nbsp;</A></B> Then Sennacherib the king of Assyria departed and went back to dwell in Nineveh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:38">37:38&nbsp;</A></B> And when he was worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons slew him with the sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.<BR>
