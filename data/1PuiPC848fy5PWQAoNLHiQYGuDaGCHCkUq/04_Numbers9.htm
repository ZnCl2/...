</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now Jehovah had spoken to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Let the children of Israel keep the passover at its appointed time.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall keep it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus Moses told the children of Israel to keep the passover.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And they kept the passover in the first <I>month,</I> on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But there were certain men who were unclean through <I>contact with</I> a dead person, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; so they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And those men said to him, Although we are unclean through <I>contact with</I> a dead person, why must we be kept from presenting the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time among the children of Israel?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Moses said to them, Stay <I>here</I> so I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Any one of you or your descendants who becomes unclean through <I>contact with</I> a dead person or is on a distant journey shall still keep the passover to Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> They shall not leave any of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to every statute of the passover they shall keep it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> But the man who is clean and is not on a journey yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not present Jehovah’s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And if a stranger sojourns with you and keeps the passover to Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native <I>born</I> in the land.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And on the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony; and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle until morning.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> So it was always; the cloud covered it <I>by day,</I> and the appearance of fire by night.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, then after that the children of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel encamped.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:18">&nbsp;9:18 &nbsp;</A></B> At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel set out, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped; as long as the cloud settled upon the tabernacle, they remained encamped.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:19">&nbsp;9:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Even when the cloud extended <I>its time</I> over the tabernacle for many days, the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah and did not set out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:20">&nbsp;9:20 &nbsp;</A></B> If sometimes the cloud was upon the tabernacle a few days, according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped; then at the commandment of Jehovah they set out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:21">&nbsp;9:21 &nbsp;</A></B> If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out; or <I>if it remained</I> a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up, they set out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:22">&nbsp;9:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Whether it was two days or a month or a longer time that the cloud extended <I>its time</I> over the tabernacle and settled above it, the children of Israel remained encamped and did not set out; but when it was taken up, they set out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:23">&nbsp;9:23 &nbsp;</A></B> At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they set out. They kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.<BR>
