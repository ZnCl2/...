</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:1">48:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Concerning Moab: / Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: / Woe to Nebo, for it is destroyed; / Kiriathaim is put to shame; it is captured; / The lofty retreat is put to shame and dismayed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:2">48:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The praise of Moab is no more; / In Heshbon they have devised evil against her, <I>saying:</I> / Come and let us cut her off from being a nation. / You also, O Madmen, will be brought to silence; / A sword will go after you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:3">48:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The sound of a cry from Horonaim, / Desolation and great destruction!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:4">48:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Moab is destroyed; / Her young have caused a cry to be heard.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:5">48:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For by the ascent of Luhith / Continual weeping will go up; / For by the descent of Horonaim / They have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:6">48:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Flee, save your life, / And be like a shrub in the wilderness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:7">48:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For because of your trust in your works and in your treasures, / You also will be captured; / And Chemosh will go forth into exile; / His priests and his princes together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:8">48:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And a destroyer will come to every city, / And no city will escape; / The valley will also perish, / And the plateau will be destroyed, / As Jehovah has said.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:9">48:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Give wings to Moab, / That she may fly <I>and</I> go away; / And her cities will become a waste, / Without inhabitant in them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:10">48:10&nbsp;</A></B> Cursed is he who does the work of Jehovah negligently, / And cursed is he who keeps his sword from blood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:11">48:11&nbsp;</A></B> Moab has been at ease from his youth; / And he is settled on his lees / And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel; / Nor has he gone into exile. / Therefore his taste remains in him, / And his scent is not changed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:12">48:12&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will send pourers to him, and they will pour and empty his vessels and shatter his jars.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:13">48:13&nbsp;</A></B> And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:14">48:14&nbsp;</A></B> How can you say, We are mighty men / And valiant men for war?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:15">48:15&nbsp;</A></B> Moab has been destroyed, / And its cities have gone up <I>in smoke,</I> / And its choice young men have gone down to slaughter, / Declares the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:16">48:16&nbsp;</A></B> The calamity of Moab is near to coming, / And his affliction hastens quickly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:17">48:17&nbsp;</A></B> Lament for him, all who are around <I>him</I> / And all who know his name; / Say, How the strong rod is broken, / The glorious staff.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:18">48:18&nbsp;</A></B> Come down from glory and sit in thirst, / O daughter who dwells in Dibon, / For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you; / He has destroyed your strongholds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:19">48:19&nbsp;</A></B> Stand by the way and watch, / O inhabitant of Aroer; / Ask him who flees and her who escapes, / <I>And</I> say, What has happened?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:20">48:20&nbsp;</A></B> Moab is put to shame, for it is shattered. / Howl and cry out; / Declare in Arnon / That Moab is devastated.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:21">48:21&nbsp;</A></B> And judgment has come upon the land of the Plateau, on Holon and on Jahzah and on Mephaath<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:22">48:22&nbsp;</A></B> And on Dibon and on Nebo and on Beth-diblathaim<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:23">48:23&nbsp;</A></B> And on Kiriathaim and on Beth-gamul and on Beth-meon<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:24">48:24&nbsp;</A></B> And on Kerioth and on Bozrah and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:25">48:25&nbsp;</A></B> The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:26">48:26&nbsp;</A></B> Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against Jehovah; so Moab will wallow in his vomit and will also be in derision.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:27">48:27&nbsp;</A></B> For was not Israel a derision to you? Or was he found among thieves? For as often as you speak of him, you shake <I>your head.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:28">48:28&nbsp;</A></B> Leave the cities and dwell in the rock, / O inhabitants of Moab, / And be like a dove who nests / On the sides of the mouth of the pit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:29">48:29&nbsp;</A></B> We have heard of the pride of Moab&nbsp;— / He is extremely proud&nbsp;— / Of his loftiness and his pride and his arrogance / And of the haughtiness of his heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:30">48:30&nbsp;</A></B> I know of his insolence, declares Jehovah; / His boastings are <I>all</I> untrue; / They have accomplished nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:31">48:31&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I will wail for Moab, / I will even cry out for all Moab; / There will be mourning for the men of Kir-heres.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:32">48:32&nbsp;</A></B> With more than the weeping of Jazer / I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah. / Your shoots have crossed over <I>to</I> the sea; / They have reached as far as the sea, to Jazer; / On your summer fruit and on your vintage / The destroyer has fallen.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:33">48:33&nbsp;</A></B> Rejoicing and exultation are taken away / From the fruited field and from the land of Moab. / And I have caused the wine from the wine presses to cease; / No one will tread <I>them</I> with the harvest shout; / The harvest shout will be no harvest shout.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:34">48:34&nbsp;</A></B> From the cry of Heshbon as far as Elealeh, even as far as Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar as far as Horonaim <I>and</I> to Eglath-shelishiyah; for even the waters of Nimrim will become a devastation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:35">48:35&nbsp;</A></B> And I will bring to an end in Moab the one who offers up in high places and burns incense to his gods, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:36">48:36&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore My heart will moan for Moab like flutes; for the men of Kir-heres My heart will also moan like flutes. As a result, the abundance he has produced has perished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:37">48:37&nbsp;</A></B> For every head is bald, and every beard is shaved off; there are cuts on all the hands, and sackcloth on the loins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:38">48:38&nbsp;</A></B> On all the roofs of Moab and in her open squares there is wailing everywhere, for I have broken Moab like a vessel which no one desires, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:39">48:39&nbsp;</A></B> How it is shattered! they howl. How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a terror to all who are around him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:40">48:40&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / One will swoop down like an eagle / And spread its wings against Moab.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:41">48:41&nbsp;</A></B> Kerioth is captured, / And the strongholds are seized, / And the heart of the mighty men of Moab in that day / Will be like the heart of a woman in labor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:42">48:42&nbsp;</A></B> And Moab will be destroyed from being a people, / Because he magnified himself against Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:43">48:43&nbsp;</A></B> Dread, pit, and snare / Are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:44">48:44&nbsp;</A></B> He who flees from dread / Will fall into the pit, / And he who comes up out of the pit / Will be taken in the snare; / For I will bring upon her, upon Moab, / The year of their punishment, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:45">48:45&nbsp;</A></B> In the shadow of Heshbon / Those who flee stand without strength; / For fire has gone forth from Heshbon / And a flame from the midst of Sihon; / And it has consumed the corner of Moab / And the top of the head of the sons of tumult.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:46">48:46&nbsp;</A></B> Woe to you, O Moab! / The people of Chemosh have perished, / For your sons have been taken captive, / And your daughters <I>have gone</I> into captivity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="48:47">48:47&nbsp;</A></B> But I will turn again the captivity of Moab / In the last days, declares Jehovah. / Thus far is the judgment of Moab.<BR>
