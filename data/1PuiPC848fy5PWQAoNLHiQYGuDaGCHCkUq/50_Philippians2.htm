</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Doing</I> nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and <I>that</I> the death of a cross.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for <I>His</I> good pleasure.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Do all things without murmurings and reasonings<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice together with you all.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:18">&nbsp;2:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And in like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:19">&nbsp;2:19 &nbsp;</A></B> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged by knowing the things concerning you.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:20">&nbsp;2:20 &nbsp;</A></B> For I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:21">&nbsp;2:21 &nbsp;</A></B> For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:22">&nbsp;2:22 &nbsp;</A></B> But you know his approvedness, that as a child with a father he has served with me unto the gospel.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:23">&nbsp;2:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:24">&nbsp;2:24 &nbsp;</A></B> But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:25">&nbsp;2:25 &nbsp;</A></B> But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your apostle and minister to my need,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:26">&nbsp;2:26 &nbsp;</A></B> Since he longed after you all and was greatly distressed because you heard that he had become sick;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:27">&nbsp;2:27 &nbsp;</A></B> For indeed he had become sick, near to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:28">&nbsp;2:28 &nbsp;</A></B> I have sent him therefore the more eagerly, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice and I may be less sorrowful.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:29">&nbsp;2:29 &nbsp;</A></B> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:30">&nbsp;2:30 &nbsp;</A></B> Because for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, risking his life, that he might fill up your lack of service toward me.<BR>
