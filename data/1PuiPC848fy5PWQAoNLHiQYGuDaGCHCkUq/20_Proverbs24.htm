</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:1">24:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be envious of evil men, / Nor desire to be with them;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:2">24:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For their heart meditates violence, / And their lips talk of mischief.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:3">24:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Through wisdom a house is built, / And by understanding it is established,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:4">24:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And by knowledge the rooms are filled / With all precious and pleasant riches.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:5">24:5 &nbsp;</A></B> A wise man is strong, / And a man of knowledge increases power.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:6">24:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For by sound counsel you can wage your war, / And in the multitude of counselors there is victory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:7">24:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Wisdom is too high for a fool; / He does not open his mouth in the gate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:8">24:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He who devises to do evil, / Men will call him a mischief-maker.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:9">24:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The devising of folly is sin, / And the scorner is an abomination to men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:10">24:10&nbsp;</A></B> If you faint in the day of adversity, / Your strength is limited.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:11">24:11&nbsp;</A></B> Deliver those who are being taken away to death, / And those who are staggering to be slain, oh, hold back!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:12">24:12&nbsp;</A></B> If you say, Look, we did not know this&nbsp;— / Does not He who weighs the hearts consider <I>it?</I> / And He who keeps your soul, does He not know <I>it ?</I> / And will He not render to every man according to his work?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:13">24:13&nbsp;</A></B> My son, eat honey, for it is good, / And the drippings from the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:14">24:14&nbsp;</A></B> Know <I>that</I> wisdom is such for your soul; / If you find <I>it,</I> then there will be a latter end, / And your hope will not be cut off.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:15">24:15&nbsp;</A></B> Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous man; / Do not destroy his resting place;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:16">24:16&nbsp;</A></B> For a righteous man falls seven times and rises up again, / But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:17">24:17&nbsp;</A></B> Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, / And do not let your heart exult when he is overthrown;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:18">24:18&nbsp;</A></B> Lest Jehovah see <I>it,</I> and it displease Him, / And He turn away His anger from him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:19">24:19&nbsp;</A></B> Do not be incensed because of evildoers; / Do not be envious of the wicked;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:20">24:20&nbsp;</A></B> For there will be no future for the evil man; / The lamp of the wicked will be put out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:21">24:21&nbsp;</A></B> My son, fear Jehovah and the king, / <I>And</I> do not associate with those who are given to change;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:22">24:22&nbsp;</A></B> For their calamity will rise suddenly, / And who knows the misfortune of both of them?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:23">24:23&nbsp;</A></B> These also are <I>sayings</I> of the wise: / It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:24">24:24&nbsp;</A></B> He who says to the wicked man, You are righteous, / Peoples will curse him; nations will abhor him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:25">24:25&nbsp;</A></B> But those who rebuke <I>the wicked man</I> will have delight, / And a good blessing will come upon them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:26">24:26&nbsp;</A></B> He who gives an honest answer / Kisses the lips.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:27">24:27&nbsp;</A></B> Prepare your work outside, / And make it ready for yourself in the field, / And afterward build your house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:28">24:28&nbsp;</A></B> Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, / And do not deceive with your lips.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:29">24:29&nbsp;</A></B> Do not say, I will do to him as he has done to me; / I will render to the man according to his work.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:30">24:30&nbsp;</A></B> I passed by the field of the sluggard, / And by the vineyard of the man lacking sense;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:31">24:31&nbsp;</A></B> And there it was, all overgrown with thorns; / Its surface was covered with nettles, / And its stone wall was broken down.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:32">24:32&nbsp;</A></B> When I looked, I considered <I>it;</I> / I saw <I>it</I> and received instruction:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:33">24:33&nbsp;</A></B> A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:34">24:34&nbsp;</A></B> And your poverty will come <I>upon you</I> like a robber, / And your want, like an armed man.<BR>
