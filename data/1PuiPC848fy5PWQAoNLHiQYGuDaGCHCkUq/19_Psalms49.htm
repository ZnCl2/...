</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:1">49:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear this, all you peoples; / Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:2">49:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Both low and high, / Rich and poor together;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:3">49:3 &nbsp;</A></B> My mouth will speak wisdom, / And the meditation of my heart will be that of understanding.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:4">49:4 &nbsp;</A></B> I will incline my ear to a parable; / I will disclose my riddle upon the harp.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:5">49:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Why should I fear in the days of evil, / When the iniquity of those who supplant me surrounds me,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:6">49:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Those who trust in their wealth / And boast in the multitude of their riches?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:7">49:7 &nbsp;</A></B> None can by any means redeem <I>his</I> brother / Or give to God a ransom for him<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:8">49:8 &nbsp;</A></B> (For the redemption of their soul is costly / And must be given up forever),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:9">49:9 &nbsp;</A></B> That he would yet live always / <I>And</I> not see corruption.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:10">49:10&nbsp;</A></B> For he will see <I>that</I> wise men die; / The foolish one and the senseless one perish alike / And leave their wealth to others.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:11">49:11&nbsp;</A></B> Their inward thought is that their houses <I>will remain</I> forever, / That their habitations <I>will remain</I> from generation to generation; / They call lands after their own names.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:12">49:12&nbsp;</A></B> But man in honor does not remain; / He is like the beasts that perish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:13">49:13&nbsp;</A></B> Such is the way of those who are self-confident, / And of those after them who approve of their sayings. Selah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:14">49:14&nbsp;</A></B> Like a flock, they are appointed for Sheol; / Death will shepherd them. / And straight to the grave they will descend, / And their form will be for Sheol to consume / That there be no abode for them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:15">49:15&nbsp;</A></B> But God will redeem my soul / From the power of Sheol, / For He will receive me. Selah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:16">49:16&nbsp;</A></B> Do not fear when a man becomes rich, / When the glory of his house increases.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:17">49:17&nbsp;</A></B> For when he dies, he will take nothing; / His glory will not descend after him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:18">49:18&nbsp;</A></B> Though he blessed his soul while he lived&nbsp;— / And <I>men</I> praise you when you do good for yourself&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:19">49:19&nbsp;</A></B> It will go to the generation of his fathers; / They will never see light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:20">49:20&nbsp;</A></B> A man in honor but without understanding / Is like the beasts that perish.<BR>
