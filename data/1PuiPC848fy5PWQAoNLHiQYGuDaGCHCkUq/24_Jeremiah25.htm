</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:2">25:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:3">25:3 &nbsp;</A></B> From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah, even unto this day, these twenty-three years, the word of Jehovah came to me, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you have not listened.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:4">25:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <I>them,</I> but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:6">25:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them; and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:7">25:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet you have not listened to Me, declares Jehovah, that you might provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:8">25:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, Because you have not listened to My words,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:10">25:10&nbsp;</A></B> And I will cause the voice of gladness and the voice of joy to perish from them, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:11">25:11&nbsp;</A></B> And this whole land will become a desolation and a waste, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:27">25:27&nbsp;</A></B> And you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Drink and be drunk, and vomit and fall, and rise no longer, because of the sword which I am sending among you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:28">25:28&nbsp;</A></B> And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, You shall surely drink <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:29">25:29&nbsp;</A></B> For I am now beginning to bring evil on the city which is called by My name, and will you indeed go unpunished?

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:30">25:30&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words and say to them,<BR>
Jehovah will roar from on high, / And He will utter His voice from His holy habitation; / He will roar mightily against His habitation; / He will respond with a shout like those who tread <I>grapes,</I> / Against all the inhabitants of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:31">25:31&nbsp;</A></B> The tumult comes to the ends of the earth, / For Jehovah has a dispute with the nations. / He is entering into judgment with all flesh / And will give up the wicked to the sword, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:32">25:32&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, / Evil is now going forth / From nation to nation, / And a great storm wind is being stirred up / From the uttermost parts of the earth.<BR>
