</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:1">12:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now concerning spiritual <I>gifts,</I> brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:2">12:2 &nbsp;</A></B> You know that when you were Gentiles, you were <I>always</I> being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:3">12:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus <I>is</I> accursed; and no one can say, Jesus <I>is</I> Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:4">12:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:5">12:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:6">12:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:7">12:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:8">12:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:9">12:9 &nbsp;</A></B> To a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:10">12:10&nbsp;</A></B> And to another operations of works of power, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits; to a different one <I>various</I> kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:11">12:11&nbsp;</A></B> But the one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:12">12:12&nbsp;</A></B> For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:13">12:13&nbsp;</A></B> For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:14">12:14&nbsp;</A></B> For the body is not one member but many.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:15">12:15&nbsp;</A></B> If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, <I>it is</I> not <I>that</I> because of this it is not of the body.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:16">12:16&nbsp;</A></B> And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, <I>it is</I> not <I>that</I> because of this it is not of the body.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:17">12:17&nbsp;</A></B> If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were the hearing, where would the smelling be?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:18">12:18&nbsp;</A></B> But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:19">12:19&nbsp;</A></B> And if all were one member, where would the body be?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:20">12:20&nbsp;</A></B> But now the members are many, but the body one.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:21">12:21&nbsp;</A></B> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:22">12:22&nbsp;</A></B> But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:23">12:23&nbsp;</A></B> And those <I>members</I> of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely <I>members come to</I> have more abundant comeliness,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:24">12:24&nbsp;</A></B> But our comely <I>members</I> have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the <I>member</I> that lacked,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:25">12:25&nbsp;</A></B> That there would be no division in the body, but <I>that</I> the members would have the same care for one another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:26">12:26&nbsp;</A></B> And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with <I>it;</I> or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:27">12:27&nbsp;</A></B> Now you are the Body of Christ, and members individually.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:28">12:28&nbsp;</A></B> And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, <I>various</I> kinds of tongues.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:29">12:29&nbsp;</A></B> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all <I>have</I> works of power?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:30">12:30&nbsp;</A></B> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret <I>tongues?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:31">12:31&nbsp;</A></B> But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And moreover I show to you a most excellent way.<BR>
