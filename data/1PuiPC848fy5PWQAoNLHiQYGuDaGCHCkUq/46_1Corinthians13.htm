</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:1">13:1 &nbsp;</A></B> If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:2">13:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And if I have <I>the gift of</I> prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:3">13:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And if I dole out all my possessions to feed <I>others,</I> and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:4">13:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous. Love does not brag <I>and</I> is not puffed up;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:5">13:5 &nbsp;</A></B> It does not behave unbecomingly <I>and</I> does not seek its own things; it is not provoked <I>and</I> does not take account of evil;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:6">13:6 &nbsp;</A></B> It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:7">13:7 &nbsp;</A></B> It covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:8">13:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Love never falls <I>away.</I> But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:9">13:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:10">13:10&nbsp;</A></B> But when that which is complete comes, that which is in part will be rendered useless.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:11">13:11&nbsp;</A></B> When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:12">13:12&nbsp;</A></B> For now we see in a mirror obscurely, but at that time face to face; now I know in part, but at that time I will fully know even as also I was fully known.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:13">13:13&nbsp;</A></B> Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.<BR>
