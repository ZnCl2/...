</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:13">12:13&nbsp;</A></B> <I>But</I> with Him are wisdom and might; / Counsel and understanding are His.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:14">12:14&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, He breaks down, and it cannot be rebuilt; / He shuts a man up, and <I>the door</I> cannot be opened.<BR>
