</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:1">22:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden concerning the valley of vision:<BR>
What then <I>troubles</I> you / That all have gone up to the housetops?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:2">22:2 &nbsp;</A></B> You who are full of noise, you tumultuous city, / You exultant town, / Your slain were not slain with the sword, / Nor are they dead because of battle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:3">22:3 &nbsp;</A></B> All your rulers have fled together; / Apart from the bow they have been captured. / All of you who were found have been captured together, / <I>Though</I> they had fled far away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:4">22:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I said, Look away from me! / Let me weep bitterly. / Do not hasten to comfort me / About the destruction of the daughter of my people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:5">22:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For there is a day of turmoil and trampling down and confusion / With the Lord Jehovah of hosts / In the valley of vision, a breaking down of walls / And crying to the mountains.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:6">22:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Elam took up the quiver, / With chariots of men <I>and</I> horsemen; / And Kir uncovered the shield.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:7">22:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Then your choicest valleys / Were full of chariots, / And the horsemen firmly fixed themselves at the gate;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:8">22:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And he removed the covering of Judah. / And you looked in that day / To the weapons of the Forest House,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:9">22:9 &nbsp;</A></B> While the breaches of the city of David / You saw to be many. / So you gathered the water of the lower pool;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:10">22:10&nbsp;</A></B> And the houses of Jerusalem you counted, / And tore down the houses to fortify the wall.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:11">22:11&nbsp;</A></B> Then you made a reservoir between the walls / For the water of the old pool. / But you did not look to its very Maker, / And He who formed it long ago you did not regard.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:12">22:12&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Called <I>you</I> in that day / To weeping and to mourning, / To <I>head</I> shaving and to wearing sackcloth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:13">22:13&nbsp;</A></B> But now there is gladness and joy, / The slaying of cattle and the slaughtering of sheep, / The eating of meat and the drinking of wine; / Eating and drinking, for tomorrow we die!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:14">22:14&nbsp;</A></B> But in my ears the Lord Jehovah of hosts revealed <I>this:</I> / This iniquity shall by no means be covered for you until you die, / Says the Lord Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:15">22:15&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says the Lord Jehovah of hosts: / Get up, go to this steward, / To Shebna, who is over the <I>king’s</I> house, <I>saying,</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:16">22:16&nbsp;</A></B> What are you doing here, and whom do you have here / That you have hewn a tomb for yourself here, / <I>As</I> he who has hewn a tomb on the heights, / <I>As</I> he who has cut out a resting place for himself in the rock?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:17">22:17&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah soon throws you far away, O mighty one, / And He grasps you firmly;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:18">22:18&nbsp;</A></B> He will wind you up tightly; / Like a ball <I>He will toss</I> you into a wide land. / There you will die; and there the chariots of your glory / <I>Will become</I> the disgrace of the house of your master.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:19">22:19&nbsp;</A></B> And I will drive you from your position, / And from your standing He will pull you down.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:20">22:20&nbsp;</A></B> And in that day / I will call to My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:21">22:21&nbsp;</A></B> And I will clothe him with your tunic, / And I will strengthen him with your girding sash, / And I will put your dominion into his hand; / And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem / And to the house of Judah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:22">22:22&nbsp;</A></B> And I will set the key of the house of David upon his shoulder&nbsp;— / When he opens, no one will shut; / When he shuts, no one will open.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:23">22:23&nbsp;</A></B> And I will drive him as a peg into a sure place, / And he will become a throne of glory for his father’s house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:24">22:24&nbsp;</A></B> And they will hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, all the smallest vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:25">22:25&nbsp;</A></B> In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, the peg driven into the sure place will be removed, even cut away, and it will fall; and the burden that was upon it will be cut down; for Jehovah has spoken.<BR>
