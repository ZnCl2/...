</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:1">33:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But now, Job, hear my speaking, / And give ear to all my words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:2">33:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed now, I have opened my mouth; / My tongue has spoken in my mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:3">33:3 &nbsp;</A></B> My words <I>manifest</I> the uprightness of my heart, / And what my lips know they speak sincerely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:4">33:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The Spirit of God has made me, / And the breath of the Almighty has enlivened me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:5">33:5 &nbsp;</A></B> If you can, respond to me; / Arrange <I>your words</I> before me; take your stand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:6">33:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I am before God as you are; / I too was cut out of clay.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:7">33:7 &nbsp;</A></B> So no fear of me can terrify you, / Nor can my pressure be heavy upon you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:8">33:8 &nbsp;</A></B> You have surely spoken in my hearing, / And I have heard the voice of <I>your</I> words, <I>saying,</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:9">33:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I am clean <I>and</I> without transgression; / I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:10">33:10&nbsp;</A></B> See, He finds occasions for hostility against me; / He considers me as His enemy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:11">33:11&nbsp;</A></B> He puts my feet in stocks; / He watches all my paths.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:12">33:12&nbsp;</A></B> However, in this you are not right, I will answer you, / For God is greater than man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:13">33:13&nbsp;</A></B> Why do you contend with Him, / <I>Saying</I> that He does not answer for any of His affairs?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:14">33:14&nbsp;</A></B> For God speaks in one way, / Indeed in two ways, without any perceiving it&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:15">33:15&nbsp;</A></B> In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men / In the slumberings upon <I>their</I> beds&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:16">33:16&nbsp;</A></B> Then He opens the ears of men / And seals up their instruction,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:17">33:17&nbsp;</A></B> That He may turn man aside <I>from his</I> doing / And hide pride from man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:18">33:18&nbsp;</A></B> He keeps his soul from the pit, / And his life from perishing by the sword.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:19">33:19&nbsp;</A></B> He is also chastened with pain upon his bed / And with continual strife in his bones,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:20">33:20&nbsp;</A></B> So that his life abhors bread, / And his soul, fancy food.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:21">33:21&nbsp;</A></B> His flesh is so consumed that it cannot be seen, / And his bones that had not been seen stick out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:22">33:22&nbsp;</A></B> And his soul draws near to the pit, / And his life, to the destroyers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:23">33:23&nbsp;</A></B> If there is with him an angel, / An interpreter, one of a thousand, / To declare to man what is right for him,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:24">33:24&nbsp;</A></B> Then He will be gracious to him and will say, / Redeem him from going down into the pit; / I have found a ransom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:25">33:25&nbsp;</A></B> His flesh will be fresher than in childhood; / He will return to the days of his youth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:26">33:26&nbsp;</A></B> He will pray to God, and He will accept him, / So that he sees His face with joyous shouting; / And God restores to man his righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:27">33:27&nbsp;</A></B> He will sing to men and say, / I sinned and perverted what was right, / But it was not paid back to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:28">33:28&nbsp;</A></B> He has redeemed my soul from perishing in the pit, / And my life will see the light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:29">33:29&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, all these things God accomplishes for a man, / Twice, even three times,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:30">33:30&nbsp;</A></B> To bring his soul back from the pit, / To enlighten <I>him</I> with the light of the living.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:31">33:31&nbsp;</A></B> Take heed, Job; hear me. / Be silent, and I will speak.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:32">33:32&nbsp;</A></B> If you have anything to say, answer me; / Speak, for I desire to justify you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:33">33:33&nbsp;</A></B> If not, you listen to me; / Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.<BR>
