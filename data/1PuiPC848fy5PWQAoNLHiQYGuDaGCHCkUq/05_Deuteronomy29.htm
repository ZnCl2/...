</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:1">29:1 &nbsp;</A></B> These are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant that He made with them at Horeb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:2">29:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Moses called to all Israel and said to them, You have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his servants, and to all his land,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:3">29:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The great trials which your eyes have seen, those great signs and wonders.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:4">29:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But Jehovah has not given you a heart to understand and eyes to see and ears to hear until this day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:5">29:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothing did not wear out from upon you, nor did your sandal wear out from upon your foot;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:6">29:6 &nbsp;</A></B> You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you might know that I am Jehovah your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:7">29:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And when you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us in battle, and we slew them;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:8">29:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:9">29:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them in order that you may prosper in all that you do.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:10">29:10&nbsp;</A></B> You are standing today, all of you, before Jehovah your God, your leaders of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, every man of Israel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:11">29:11&nbsp;</A></B> Your little ones, your wives, and the sojourner with you, who is in the midst of your camp, from the man who chops your wood to the man who draws your water,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:12">29:12&nbsp;</A></B> In order to enter into a covenant with Jehovah your God and into His oath, which Jehovah your God is making with you today,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:13">29:13&nbsp;</A></B> So that He may establish you today as His people and that He may be your God, even as He has spoken to you and even as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:14">29:14&nbsp;</A></B> However not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:15">29:15&nbsp;</A></B> But <I>I make it</I> with him who is here today standing with us before Jehovah our God and with him who is not here with us today.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:16">29:16&nbsp;</A></B> For you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we passed through the midst of the nations whom you passed through,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:17">29:17&nbsp;</A></B> And you saw their detestable <I>images</I> and their idols, <I>mere</I> wood and stone, silver and gold, which were with them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:18">29:18&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Beware</I> that there is not among you any man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turns away, <I>even</I> today, from Jehovah our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations; that there is not among you a root bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:19">29:19&nbsp;</A></B> And <I>that</I> when he hears the words of this oath, he blesses himself in his heart, saying, I will have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart; to the ruin of the moist with the dry.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:20">29:20&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah will not be willing to pardon him; but rather the anger of Jehovah and His jealousy will fume against that man, and all the oath that is written in this book will settle on him, and Jehovah will blot out his name from under heaven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:21">29:21&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the oaths of the covenant written in this book of the law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:22">29:22&nbsp;</A></B> And the following generation, your children who will rise up after you and the foreigner who will come from a distant land, will say, when they see the plagues of that land and its diseases with which Jehovah has made it sick;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:23">29:23&nbsp;</A></B> <I>And that</I> all its land is sulfur and salt, a burning waste; <I>that</I> it is not sown, nor does it sprout, nor does any vegetation come up in it; <I>that</I> it is like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Jehovah overthrew in His anger and burning wrath&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:24">29:24&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed all the nations will say, Why has Jehovah done this to this land? Why the burning of this great anger?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:25">29:25&nbsp;</A></B> And they will say, <I>It is</I> because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out from the land of Egypt;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:26">29:26&nbsp;</A></B> And they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods whom they had not known and He had not allotted to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:27">29:27&nbsp;</A></B> And the anger of Jehovah burned against this land, bringing upon it all the curses written in this book;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:28">29:28&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah plucked them off their land in anger and in burning wrath and in great indignation, and sent them to another land, as <I>they are</I> this day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:29">29:29&nbsp;</A></B> The things that are hidden belong to Jehovah our God; but the things that are revealed, to us and our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.<BR>
