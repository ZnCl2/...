</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:1">78:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; / Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:2">78:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I will open my mouth in a parable; / I will utter riddles from of old,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:3">78:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Which we have heard and known, / And our fathers have related to us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:4">78:4 &nbsp;</A></B> We will not hide <I>them</I> from their children, / <I>But</I> will relate to the generation to come / The praises of Jehovah and His strength / And His wondrous deeds that He has done.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:5">78:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed He has established a testimony in Jacob / And appointed a law in Israel, / Which He commanded our fathers / That they should make them known to their children;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:6">78:6 &nbsp;</A></B> That the generation to come, / The children to be born, may know <I>them,</I> / <I>Who</I> should arise and relate <I>them</I> to their children;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:7">78:7 &nbsp;</A></B> That they might set their hope in God, / And not forget the deeds of God, / But observe His commandments;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:8">78:8 &nbsp;</A></B> That they might not be like their fathers, / A stubborn and rebellious generation, / A generation that did not set their heart right, / And whose spirit was not faithful to God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:9">78:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The children of Ephraim, armed archers with bows, / Turned back in the day of battle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:10">78:10&nbsp;</A></B> They did not keep the covenant of God, / And they refused to walk in His law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:11">78:11&nbsp;</A></B> And they forgot His doings / And His wondrous deeds that He had shown them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:12">78:12&nbsp;</A></B> He did something wonderful in the sight of their fathers / In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:13">78:13&nbsp;</A></B> He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, / And He made the water stand as a heap.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:14">78:14&nbsp;</A></B> And He led them with the cloud by day / And all the night with a light of fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:15">78:15&nbsp;</A></B> He split rocks in the wilderness / And gave <I>them</I> abundant drink, as from the depths.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:16">78:16&nbsp;</A></B> He also brought forth streams from the rock / And made water run down like rivers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:17">78:17&nbsp;</A></B> Yet they still continued to sin against Him, / To rebel against the Most High in the desert.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:18">78:18&nbsp;</A></B> And they put God to the test in their heart, / By asking for food according to their desire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:19">78:19&nbsp;</A></B> They also spoke against God; / They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:20">78:20&nbsp;</A></B> Behold, He struck the rock, / And water gushed out, / And streams overflowed; / Can He also give <I>us</I> bread, / Or provide meat for His people?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:21">78:21&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore Jehovah heard and was angry. / And a fire was kindled against Jacob, / And also anger went up against Israel;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:22">78:22&nbsp;</A></B> Because they did not believe in God, / And they did not trust in His salvation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:23">78:23&nbsp;</A></B> Yet He commanded the skies above / And opened the doors of heaven;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:24">78:24&nbsp;</A></B> And He rained down upon them manna to eat / And gave them the food of heaven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:25">78:25&nbsp;</A></B> Man ate the bread of the mighty; / He sent them full provision.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:26">78:26&nbsp;</A></B> He made the east wind blow in the heavens / And guided the south wind by His strength.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:27">78:27&nbsp;</A></B> And He rained upon them meat like dust, / And winged birds like the sand of the seas.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:28">78:28&nbsp;</A></B> And He made <I>it</I> fall in the midst of their camp, / Around their habitations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:29">78:29&nbsp;</A></B> So they ate and were well filled; / Indeed what they desired He brought to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:30">78:30&nbsp;</A></B> They were not estranged from what they desired; / Their food was still in their mouths<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:31">78:31&nbsp;</A></B> When the anger of God went up against them / And slew <I>some</I> of their fattest ones / And struck down the choice men of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:32">78:32&nbsp;</A></B> In spite of all this they still sinned / And did not believe in His wondrous deeds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:33">78:33&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore He consumed their days with vanity, / And their years with terror.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:34">78:34&nbsp;</A></B> When He slew them, they inquired after Him, / And they returned and diligently sought God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:35">78:35&nbsp;</A></B> And they remembered that God was their rock, / And the Most High God, their Redeemer.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:36">78:36&nbsp;</A></B> But they flattered Him with their mouth / And lied to Him with their tongue.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:37">78:37&nbsp;</A></B> For their heart was not steadfast toward Him, / Nor were they faithful to His covenant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:38">78:38&nbsp;</A></B> But He, being merciful, forgave <I>their</I> iniquity / And did not destroy <I>them;</I> / Indeed He turned back His anger many times / And did not stir up all His wrath.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:39">78:39&nbsp;</A></B> And He remembered that they were flesh, / A wind that goes away and does not return.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:40">78:40&nbsp;</A></B> How often they rebelled against Him in the wilderness / And grieved Him in the desert!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:41">78:41&nbsp;</A></B> And they repeatedly put God to the test / And provoked the Holy One of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:42">78:42&nbsp;</A></B> They did not remember His hand, / The day when He ransomed them from the adversary;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:43">78:43&nbsp;</A></B> When He set His signs in Egypt / And His wonders in the field of Zoan;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:44">78:44&nbsp;</A></B> And He turned their rivers into blood, / As well as their streams, so that they could not drink.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:45">78:45&nbsp;</A></B> He sent among them a swarm <I>of</I> <I>flies,</I> which devoured them; / And frogs, which destroyed them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:46">78:46&nbsp;</A></B> And He gave their increase to the consuming locust, / And their labor to the swarming locust.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:47">78:47&nbsp;</A></B> And He killed their vines with hail, / And their sycamores with ice stones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:48">78:48&nbsp;</A></B> He gave over their cattle also to the hail / And their herds to the lightning bolts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:49">78:49&nbsp;</A></B> He sent among them the burning fierceness of His anger, / Overflowing wrath and indignation and trouble, / A mission of angels of evils.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:50">78:50&nbsp;</A></B> He leveled a path for His anger; / He did not spare their soul from death, / But gave their life over to the pestilence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:51">78:51&nbsp;</A></B> And He struck all the firstborn in Egypt, / The firstfruits of their vigor in the tents of Ham.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:52">78:52&nbsp;</A></B> But He set forth His people like sheep / And led them like a flock in the wilderness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:53">78:53&nbsp;</A></B> And He led them to safety, so that they did not fear; / But the sea covered their enemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:54">78:54&nbsp;</A></B> And He brought them forth to His holy border, / The mountain, which His right hand had acquired.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:55">78:55&nbsp;</A></B> And He drove out the nations before them / And allotted them as an inheritance by line, / And He made the tribes of Israel dwell <I>there</I> in their tents.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:56">78:56&nbsp;</A></B> Yet they put <I>Him</I> to the test and rebelled against God the Most High, / And did not keep His testimonies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:57">78:57&nbsp;</A></B> And they turned back and dealt treacherously, as their fathers <I>had done;</I> / They turned aside like a deceitful bow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:58">78:58&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed they provoked Him to anger with their high places / And made Him jealous with their graven images.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:59">78:59&nbsp;</A></B> God heard, and He was angered; / And He greatly abhorred Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:60">78:60&nbsp;</A></B> Thus He forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, / The tent <I>in which</I> He dwelt among men;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:61">78:61&nbsp;</A></B> And He gave over His Ark into captivity, / And His glory into the hand of the adversary.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:62">78:62&nbsp;</A></B> He also delivered His people to the sword / And was angry with His inheritance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:63">78:63&nbsp;</A></B> Fire devoured their young men, / And their virgins had no marriage song.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:64">78:64&nbsp;</A></B> Their priests fell by the sword, / And their widows did not lament.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:65">78:65&nbsp;</A></B> Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, / Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:66">78:66&nbsp;</A></B> And He struck His adversaries <I>and sent them</I> back; / He put an everlasting reproach upon them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:67">78:67&nbsp;</A></B> And He rejected the tent of Joseph, / And the tribe of Ephraim He did not choose.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:68">78:68&nbsp;</A></B> Rather He chose the tribe of Judah, / Mount Zion, which He loved.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:69">78:69&nbsp;</A></B> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, / Like the earth that He has founded forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:70">78:70&nbsp;</A></B> Moreover He chose David His servant / And took him from the sheepfolds;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:71">78:71&nbsp;</A></B> From following after the ewes He brought him / To shepherd Jacob His people / And Israel His inheritance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="78:72">78:72&nbsp;</A></B> And he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, / And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.<BR>
