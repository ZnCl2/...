</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But fornication and all uncleanness or greediness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting, which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For this you realize, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or greedy person (who is an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore do not be partakers with them;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> (For the fruit of the light <I>consists</I> in all goodness and righteousness and truth),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove <I>them</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For the things which are done by them in secret it is shameful even to speak of.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:17">&nbsp;5:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:18">&nbsp;5:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:19">&nbsp;5:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:20">&nbsp;5:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to <I>our</I> God and Father,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:21">&nbsp;5:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ:<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:22">&nbsp;5:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Wives, <I>be</I> <I>subject</I> to your own husbands as to the Lord;<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:23">&nbsp;5:23 &nbsp;</A></B> For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself <I>being</I> the Savior of the Body.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:24">&nbsp;5:24 &nbsp;</A></B> But as the church is subject to Christ, so also <I>let</I> the wives <I>be subject</I> to their husbands in everything.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:25">&nbsp;5:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:26">&nbsp;5:26 &nbsp;</A></B> That He might sanctify her, cleansing <I>her</I> by the washing of the water in the word,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:27">&nbsp;5:27 &nbsp;</A></B> That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:28">&nbsp;5:28 &nbsp;</A></B> In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:29">&nbsp;5:29 &nbsp;</A></B> For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:30">&nbsp;5:30 &nbsp;</A></B> Because we are members of His Body.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:31">&nbsp;5:31 &nbsp;</A></B> For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:32">&nbsp;5:32 &nbsp;</A></B> This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:33">&nbsp;5:33 &nbsp;</A></B> Nevertheless you also, each one of you, in the same way love your own wife as yourself; and the wife should fear her husband.<BR>
