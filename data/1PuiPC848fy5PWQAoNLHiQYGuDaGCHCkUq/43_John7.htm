</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles was near.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be <I>known</I> openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For not even His brothers believed into Him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not openly, but as <I>it were</I> in secret.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews therefore sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds: some said, He is a good man; but others said, No; rather He leads the crowd astray.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Jews.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews therefore marveled and said, How does this man know letters, without ever having studied?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:18">&nbsp;7:18 &nbsp;</A></B> He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:19">&nbsp;7:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill Me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:20">&nbsp;7:20 &nbsp;</A></B> The crowd answered, You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:21">&nbsp;7:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:22">&nbsp;7:22 &nbsp;</A></B> For the same reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:23">&nbsp;7:23 &nbsp;</A></B> If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:24">&nbsp;7:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not judge according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:25">&nbsp;7:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the One whom they are seeking to kill?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:26">&nbsp;7:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers, perhaps, really recognized that this is the Christ?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:27">&nbsp;7:27 &nbsp;</A></B> But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:28">&nbsp;7:28 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:29">&nbsp;7:29 &nbsp;</A></B> I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:30">&nbsp;7:30 &nbsp;</A></B> They sought then to seize Him, yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:31">&nbsp;7:31 &nbsp;</A></B> But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:32">&nbsp;7:32 &nbsp;</A></B> The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:33">&nbsp;7:33 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus therefore said, I am still with you a little while, and <I>then</I> I am going to Him who sent Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:34">&nbsp;7:34 &nbsp;</A></B> You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:35">&nbsp;7:35 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews then said to one another, Where is this man about to go that we will not find Him? Is He about to go to the <I>Jews in</I> dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:36">&nbsp;7:36 &nbsp;</A></B> What is the word which He said, You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:37">&nbsp;7:37 &nbsp;</A></B> Now on the last day, the great <I>day</I> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:38">&nbsp;7:38 &nbsp;</A></B> He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:39">&nbsp;7:39 &nbsp;</A></B> But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for <I>the</I> Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:40">&nbsp;7:40 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Some</I> of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the Prophet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:41">&nbsp;7:41 &nbsp;</A></B> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:42">&nbsp;7:42 &nbsp;</A></B> Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:43">&nbsp;7:43 &nbsp;</A></B> So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:44">&nbsp;7:44 &nbsp;</A></B> And some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:45">&nbsp;7:45 &nbsp;</A></B> The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and these said to them, Why did you not bring Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:46">&nbsp;7:46 &nbsp;</A></B> The attendants answered, Never has a man spoken as this man <I>has.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:47">&nbsp;7:47 &nbsp;</A></B> The Pharisees then answered them, Have you also been deceived?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:48">&nbsp;7:48 &nbsp;</A></B> Has any one of the rulers or Pharisees believed into Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:49">&nbsp;7:49 &nbsp;</A></B> But this crowd which does not know the law is accursed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:50">&nbsp;7:50 &nbsp;</A></B> Nicodemus said to them (he who came to Him before, being one of them),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:51">&nbsp;7:51 &nbsp;</A></B> Does our law condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:52">&nbsp;7:52 &nbsp;</A></B> They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:53">&nbsp;7:53 &nbsp;</A></B> And everyone went to his <I>own</I> house.<BR>
