</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there was a man, and in His hand was a measuring line.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And I said, Where are you going? And He said to me, To measure Jerusalem; to see how great its breadth is and how great its length is.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Then at that point the angel who spoke with me went forth and another angel came forth to meet him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will lie as an open region due to the multitude of men and cattle within it,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For I will be her wall of fire round about, declares Jehovah, and I will be the glory within her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Ho! Ho! Flee from the land of the north, declares Jehovah, for I have spread you out like the four winds of the heavens, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Ho, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah of hosts, After the glory He has sent Me against the nations who plunder you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For I am now waving My hand over them, and they will be plunder for those who served them; and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Give a ringing shout and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for now I am coming, and I will dwell in your midst, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day and will become My people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will inherit Judah as His portion upon the holy land, and He will again choose Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Hush, all flesh, before Jehovah! For He is roused up from His holy habitation.<BR>
