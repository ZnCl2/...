</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:1">10:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Israel is a luxuriant vine; / He brings forth fruit for himself. / According to the abundance of his fruit / He has multiplied altars; / According to the goodness of their land / They have made pillars well.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:2">10:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Their heart is divided; / Now they will be found guilty. / He Himself will break down their altars; / He will destroy their pillars.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:3">10:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For now they will say, / We have no king, / For we did not fear Jehovah; / And the king, what can he do for us?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:4">10:4 &nbsp;</A></B> They speak <I>mere</I> words, / Swearing falsely / While making a covenant; / And judgment sprouts forth like poisonous weeds / In the furrows of the field.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:5">10:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The inhabitants of Samaria will fear / For the calves of Beth-aven; / For its people will mourn over it, / And its idol priests will tremble for it, / For its glory, / Because it has departed from it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:6">10:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed it will be carried to Assyria: / A present to the warrior king. / Ephraim will be taken in shame, / And Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:7">10:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Samaria will be cut off <I>with</I> her king / <I>And will be</I> like twigs on the surface of the water.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:8">10:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, / Will be destroyed. / The thorn and the thistle will come up / Upon their altars; / And they will say to the mountains, Cover us! / And to the hills, Fall on us!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:9">10:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Since the days of Gibeah / You have sinned, O Israel; / There they have stood. / Did not the battle / Overtake them in Gibeah / Because of the children of iniquity?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:10">10:10&nbsp;</A></B> When I so desire, I will chastise them; / And the peoples will be gathered against them, / When they are bound for their double iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:11">10:11&nbsp;</A></B> And Ephraim is a trained heifer / That loves to tread <I>the grain;</I> / But I have passed <I>the yoke</I> / Over her fair neck: / I will make Ephraim draw <I>the plow;</I> / Judah will plow; / Jacob will break his clods.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:12">10:12&nbsp;</A></B> Sow unto righteousness for yourselves; / Reap according to lovingkindness; / Break up your fallow ground; / For it is time to seek Jehovah / Until He comes and rains / Righteousness on you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:13">10:13&nbsp;</A></B> You have plowed wickedness; / You have reaped injustice; / You have eaten the fruit of lying. / For you have trusted in your way, / In the multitude of your mighty men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:14">10:14&nbsp;</A></B> And a tumult will arise among your peoples; / And all your fortresses will be devastated, / As Shalman devastated Beth-arbel / In the day of battle: / The mother was dashed in pieces with the children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:15">10:15&nbsp;</A></B> Thus Bethel will cause this to happen to you / Because of your great evil: / At dawn the king of Israel / Will be utterly cut off.<BR>
