</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:1">15:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:2">15:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured among <I>themselves,</I> saying, This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:3">15:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And He told them this parable, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:4">15:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Which man of you, who has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:5">15:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And when he finds <I>it,</I> he lays <I>it</I> on his shoulders, rejoicing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:6">15:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And when he comes into his house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:7">15:7 &nbsp;</A></B> I tell you that in the same way there will be <I>more</I> joy in heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:8">15:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one silver coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully until she finds <I>it?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:9">15:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And when she finds <I>it,</I> she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:10">15:10&nbsp;</A></B> In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:11">15:11&nbsp;</A></B> And He said, A certain man had two sons.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:12">15:12&nbsp;</A></B> And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to <I>me</I>. And he distributed to them his living.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:13">15:13&nbsp;</A></B> And not many days after, the younger son, having gathered everything together, went abroad to a distant country and there squandered his estate by living dissolutely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:14">15:14&nbsp;</A></B> And when he had spent all, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he began to be in want.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:15">15:15&nbsp;</A></B> And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed hogs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:16">15:16&nbsp;</A></B> And he longed to be satisfied with the carob pods which the hogs were eating, and no one gave him <I>anything</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:17">15:17&nbsp;</A></B> But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired servants abound in bread, but I am perishing here in famine!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:18">15:18&nbsp;</A></B> I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:19">15:19&nbsp;</A></B> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:20">15:20&nbsp;</A></B> And he rose up and came to his own father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:21">15:21&nbsp;</A></B> And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:22">15:22&nbsp;</A></B> But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put <I>it</I> on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:23">15:23&nbsp;</A></B> And bring the fattened calf; slaughter <I>it,</I> and let us eat and be merry,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:24">15:24&nbsp;</A></B> Because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found. And they began to be merry.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:25">15:25&nbsp;</A></B> Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:26">15:26&nbsp;</A></B> And calling to <I>him</I> one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:27">15:27&nbsp;</A></B> And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has received him back healthy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:28">15:28&nbsp;</A></B> But he became angry and was not willing to enter. And his father came out and entreated him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:29">15:29&nbsp;</A></B> But he answered and said to his father, Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours, and you have never given me a goat that I might be merry with my friends;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:30">15:30&nbsp;</A></B> But when this son of yours came, who devoured your living with harlots, you slaughtered for him the fattened calf.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:31">15:31&nbsp;</A></B> And he said to him, Child, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:32">15:32&nbsp;</A></B> But we had to be merry and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life, and he was lost and has been found.<BR>
