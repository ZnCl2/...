</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> As many as are slaves under the yoke should regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, lest the name of God and our teaching be blasphemed.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And those who have believing masters should not despise <I>them,</I> because they are brothers; but rather they should serve <I>them,</I> because those who recompense <I>them</I> for the kindly service <I>received</I> are believers and beloved. These things teach and exhort.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone teaches different things and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He is blinded with pride, understanding nothing, but is diseased with questionings and contentions of words, out of which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, supposing godliness to be a <I>means of</I> gain.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But godliness with contentment is great gain;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For we have brought nothing into the world, because neither can we carry anything out.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But having food and covering, with these we will be content.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But those who intend to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For the love of money is a root of all evils, <I>because of</I> which some, aspiring after <I>money,</I> have been led away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many pains.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life, to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> To keep the commandment spotless, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Which in its own times the blessed and only Sovereign will show, the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:16">&nbsp;6:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see, to whom be honor and eternal might. Amen.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:17">&nbsp;6:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches but on God, who affords us all things richly for <I>our</I> enjoyment;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:18">&nbsp;6:18 &nbsp;</A></B> To do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to distribute, to be ones willing to share;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:19">&nbsp;6:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Laying away for themselves a good foundation as a treasure for the future, that they may lay hold on that which is really life.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:20">&nbsp;6:20 &nbsp;</A></B> O Timothy, guard the deposit, turning away from profane, vain babblings and oppositions from what is falsely called knowledge,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:21">&nbsp;6:21 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Because of</I> which some, professing <I>this,</I> have misaimed regarding the faith.<BR> 

Grace be with you.<BR>
