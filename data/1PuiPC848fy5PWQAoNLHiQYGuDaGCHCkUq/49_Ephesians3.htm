</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the Gentiles&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> By which, in reading <I>it,</I> you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> That in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the operation of His power.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And to enlighten all <I>that they may see</I> what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> In whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I ask <I>you</I> not to faint at my afflictions for your sake, since they are your glory.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith,<BR>

that you, being rooted and grounded in love,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> May be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ,<BR>

that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:20">&nbsp;3:20 &nbsp;</A></B> But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:21">&nbsp;3:21 &nbsp;</A></B> To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.<BR>
