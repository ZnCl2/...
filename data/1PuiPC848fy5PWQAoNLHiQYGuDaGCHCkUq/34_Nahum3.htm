</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to the bloody city! / She is all full of lies <I>and</I> pillage; / The prey does not depart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The sound of the whip, / And the sound of the rattling wheel; / And the horse galloping, / And the chariot jolting by,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The horseman making <I>the horse</I> to rear up, / And the sword flashing, / And the spear glittering; / And a multitude of the slain, / And a mass of corpses, / And no end to the bodies&nbsp;— / They stumble among their bodies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>This</I> because of the multitude of harlotries / Of the well-favored harlot, / The mistress of sorceries, / Who sells nations by her harlotries / And families by her sorceries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed I am against you, declares Jehovah of hosts; / And I will throw open your skirts upon your face, / And I will show the nations your nakedness, / And the kingdoms your shame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will cast abominable filth upon you / And make you appear foolish and make you like a spectacle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And everyone who sees you / Will flee from you and say, / Nineveh is laid waste. / Who will lament for her? / Where will I seek / Some to comfort you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Are you better than No-amon, / Who sat beside the canals / With waters all around her, / Whose bulwark was the sea / <I>And</I> water was her wall?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Cush was her strength, / As well as Egypt, and it was without end; / Put and the Libyans / Were among her helpers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> She too was carried away; / She went into captivity; / Her little ones too were dashed to pieces / At the head of every street, / And for her nobles / They cast lots, / And all her great men / Were bound in chains.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> You too will be drunken; / You will be hidden. / You too will seek / A stronghold from the enemy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> All your fortresses will be <I>like</I> fig trees / With first ripe figs: / If they are shaken, they will fall / Into the mouth of the eater.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed your people are <I>like</I> women / In the midst of you; / Unto your enemies the gates of your land / Are wide open; / Fire devours your bars.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Draw for yourself water for the siege! / Strengthen your fortresses! / Go into the clay, / And tread in the mortar! / Make the brick kiln ready!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> There will the fire devour you; / The sword will cut you off; / It will devour you like the locust. / Enlarge yourself like the locust; / Enlarge yourself like the locust swarm.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> You have multiplied your merchants / Like the stars of heaven; / The locust strips <I>everything</I> and flies away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Your princes are like the locust swarm, / And your officials are like hordes of locusts, / Which camp in the hedges / On a cold day, / But when the sun arises, they flee away, / And the place where they are is unknown.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Your shepherds slumber, / O king of Assyria; / Your nobles sleep. / Your people are scattered upon the mountains, / And there is no one to gather <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> There is no alleviating of your injury; / Your wound is grievous. / All who hear the report of you / Clap their hands over you; / For upon whom has your wickedness / Not passed continually?<BR>
