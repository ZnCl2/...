</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:25">15:25&nbsp;</A></B> And the priest shall make expiation for the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was unintentional, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to Jehovah, and their sin offering before Jehovah for their error.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:26">15:26&nbsp;</A></B> And the whole assembly of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them; for all the people <I>were involved</I> unintentionally.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:27">15:27&nbsp;</A></B> And if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall present a female goat a year old for a sin offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:28">15:28&nbsp;</A></B> And the priest shall make expiation before Jehovah for the person who sinned unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally, to make expiation for him; and he shall be forgiven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:29">15:29&nbsp;</A></B> You shall have one law for the one who does anything unintentionally, for one who is a native among the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:30">15:30&nbsp;</A></B> But the person who does anything with a high hand, whether a native or a sojourner, that one reviles Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from among his people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:31">15:31&nbsp;</A></B> Because he has despised the word of Jehovah and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:32">15:32&nbsp;</A></B> Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:33">15:33&nbsp;</A></B> And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to the whole assembly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:34">15:34&nbsp;</A></B> And they put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:36">15:36&nbsp;</A></B> So the whole assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:37">15:37&nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:38">15:38&nbsp;</A></B> Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations and to put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:39">15:39&nbsp;</A></B> And it shall be a fringe for you, so that when you see it you will remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them, so that you do not seek after your own heart and your own eyes, according to which you committed fornication;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:40">15:40&nbsp;</A></B> That you shall remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:41">15:41&nbsp;</A></B> I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am Jehovah your God.<BR>
