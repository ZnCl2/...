</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:1">13:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Let brotherly love continue.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:2">13:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not forget hospitality, for through this some, without knowing it, have entertained angels.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:3">13:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember those who are imprisoned as bound with <I>them,</I> those who are ill-treated as being yourselves also <I>likewise treated</I> in body.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:4">13:4 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Let</I> marriage <I>be held</I> in honor among all, and the bed undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:5">13:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Let your way of life be without the love of money, being satisfied with the things which are at hand; for He Himself has said, “I shall by no means give you up, neither by any means shall I abandon you”;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:6">13:6 &nbsp;</A></B> So that being of good courage, we say, “The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear. What shall man do to me?”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:7">13:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:8">13:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, <I>yes,</I> even forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:9">13:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be carried away by various strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be confirmed by grace, not by the food <I>of sacrifices,</I> by which those who walk were not profited.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:10">13:10&nbsp;</A></B> We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:11">13:11&nbsp;</A></B> For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the <I>Holy of</I> Holies for sin by the high priest are burned up outside the camp.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:12">13:12&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:13">13:13&nbsp;</A></B> Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:14">13:14&nbsp;</A></B> For we do not have here a remaining city, but we seek after the one to come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:15">13:15&nbsp;</A></B> Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:16">13:16&nbsp;</A></B> But do not forget doing good and sharing <I>with others,</I> for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:17">13:17&nbsp;</A></B> Obey the ones leading you and submit to <I>them,</I> for they watch over your souls as those who will render an account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning; for this would be unprofitable to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:18">13:18&nbsp;</A></B> Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to conduct ourselves honorably.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:19">13:19&nbsp;</A></B> And I exhort <I>you</I> much more to do this that I may be restored to you more quickly.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:20">13:20&nbsp;</A></B> Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:21">13:21&nbsp;</A></B> Perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:22">13:22&nbsp;</A></B> Now I beseech you, brothers, bear with the word of this exhortation, for indeed I have written to you in few words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:23">13:23&nbsp;</A></B> Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:24">13:24&nbsp;</A></B> Greet all the ones leading you and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:25">13:25&nbsp;</A></B> Grace be with you all. Amen.<BR>
