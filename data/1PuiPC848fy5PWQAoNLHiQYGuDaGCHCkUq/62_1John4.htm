</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God; and this is the <I>spirit</I> of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming and now is already in the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> They are of the world; therefore they speak out of the world, and the world hears them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And we have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> In this has love been perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of the judgment because even as He is, <I>so</I> also are we in this world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear because fear has punishment, and he who fears has not been perfected in love.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> We love because He first loved us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:20">&nbsp;4:20 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:21">&nbsp;4:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God love his brother also.<BR>
