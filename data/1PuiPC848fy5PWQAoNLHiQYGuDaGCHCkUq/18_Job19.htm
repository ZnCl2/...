</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:1">19:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:2">19:2 &nbsp;</A></B> How long will you grieve my soul / And crush me with <I>your</I> words?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:3">19:3 &nbsp;</A></B> These ten times you have reproached me; / You are not ashamed to deal wrongly with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:4">19:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And be it that I have erred, / My error remains with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:5">19:5 &nbsp;</A></B> If you indeed magnify yourselves against me / And use my reproach in argument against me,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:6">19:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Know then that God has subverted my cause / And compassed me about with His net.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:7">19:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I cry out, Violence! and I am not answered; / I call for help, and there is no justice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:8">19:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass; / And He has put darkness upon my paths.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:9">19:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He has stripped my glory from me / And taken away the crown on my head.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:10">19:10&nbsp;</A></B> He has broken me all around, and I am gone; / And my hope is plucked up like a tree.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:11">19:11&nbsp;</A></B> He has also kindled His anger against me, / And in Himself He considers me as His adversary.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:12">19:12&nbsp;</A></B> His troops come together / And cast up their highway against me / And encamp all around my tent.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:13">19:13&nbsp;</A></B> He has removed my brothers far from me, / And those who know me are wholly estranged from me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:14">19:14&nbsp;</A></B> My relatives have failed <I>me,</I> / And my acquaintances have forgotten me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:15">19:15&nbsp;</A></B> Those who sojourn in my house and my maids consider me as a stranger; / I am a foreigner in their eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:16">19:16&nbsp;</A></B> To my servant I call out, but he does not answer; / I entreat him with my mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:17">19:17&nbsp;</A></B> My breath is strange to my wife; / And my supplications, to the children of my <I>mother’s</I> womb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:18">19:18&nbsp;</A></B> Even little children despise me: / I arise and they speak against me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:19">19:19&nbsp;</A></B> All the men whom I take counsel with abhor me, / And those whom I love have turned against me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:20">19:20&nbsp;</A></B> My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, / And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:21">19:21&nbsp;</A></B> Pity me, pity me, O my friends; / For the hand of God has touched me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:22">19:22&nbsp;</A></B> Why do you persecute me as God does / And are not satisfied with <I>eating</I> my flesh?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:23">19:23&nbsp;</A></B> Oh, that my words were now written! / Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:24">19:24&nbsp;</A></B> That with an iron pen and with lead / They were engraved in rock forever!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:25">19:25&nbsp;</A></B> But I know that my Redeemer lives, / And at the last He will stand upon the earth;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:26">19:26&nbsp;</A></B> And after this body of mine is destroyed, / Outside my flesh I will look on God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:27">19:27&nbsp;</A></B> Whom I, even I, will look on for myself, / And my eyes will see; <I>I,</I> and no other. / My inward parts that long for <I>God</I> are consumed within me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:28">19:28&nbsp;</A></B> If you say, How will we persecute him? / For the root of the matter is found in him;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:29">19:29&nbsp;</A></B> Be fearful of the sword, / For wrath <I>brings</I> the punishment of the sword, / That you may know that there is a judgment.<BR>
