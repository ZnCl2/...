</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not rejoice, O Israel, / To exult like the nations. / For you have gone as a harlot away from your God; / You have loved payment / Upon every grain floor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them, / And the new wine will fail her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> They will not dwell in the land of Jehovah; / But Ephraim will return to Egypt, / And in Assyria they will eat what is unclean.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> They will not pour out offerings of wine to Jehovah, / Neither will their sacrifices be pleasing to Him; / They will be to them as the bread of mourning; / All who eat them will be unclean, / For their bread will be for themselves; / It will not come into the house of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> What will you do / In the day of assembly / And in the day of the feast of Jehovah?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For they will go because of destruction; / Egypt will gather them; / Moph will bury them. / As for their desirable things of silver, nettles will dispossess them; / Thistles will be in their tents.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The days of the visitation have come; / The days of the recompense have come; / Israel will know <I>it.</I> / The prophet is a fool, / The inspired man is mad, / Because of the greatness of your iniquity / And <I>because of</I> the greatness of the enmity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim was a watchman / With my God. / As for the prophet, a fowler’s trap / Is in all his ways; / Enmity is in the house of his God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> They have deeply corrupted themselves / As in the days of Gibeah; / He will remember their iniquity; / He will punish their sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> I found Israel / Like grapes in the wilderness; / I saw your fathers / As the first ripe fruit on the fig tree at its beginning. / They went to Baal-peor / And sanctified themselves unto the shameful thing, / And they became detestable, like the thing that they loved.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> As for Ephraim, their glory / Will fly away like a bird&nbsp;— / No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For even if they bring up their children, / I will bereave them, <I>so that</I> not a man <I>is left.</I> / Indeed woe also to them / When I turn away from them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim, as I have seen <I>him,</I> / Is planted like Tyre in a meadow; / But Ephraim will bring forth / His children to the slayer.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Give them, O Jehovah&nbsp;— / What will You give <I>them?</I> / Give them a miscarrying womb / And dry breasts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> All their evil is in Gilgal, / For there I hated them. / Because of the evil of their doings / I will drive them from My house, / I will love them no more; / All their princes are rebels.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim is stricken; / Their root is dried up; / They will not bear fruit. / Indeed though they bring forth, / I will kill the beloved <I>fruit</I> of their womb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> My God has rejected them, / For they did not listen to Him. / And they will be wanderers among the nations.<BR>
