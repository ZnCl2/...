</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:13">19:13&nbsp;</A></B> A foolish son is the ruin of his father, / And the contentions of a wife are a continual dripping.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:14">19:14&nbsp;</A></B> House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, / But a prudent wife is from Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:17">19:17&nbsp;</A></B> He who has pity upon a poor man lends to Jehovah, / And He will repay him for his good deed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:18">19:18&nbsp;</A></B> Discipline your son, for there is hope; / But do not set your heart on destroying him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:19">19:19&nbsp;</A></B> A man of great wrath will bear the penalty; / For if you deliver <I>him,</I> you will only have to do it again.<BR>
