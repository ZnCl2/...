</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up, <I>along</I> with his brothers the priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers, and they built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And they set up the altar upon its bases, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Jehovah, burnt offerings of the morning and evening.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And they held the Feast of Tabernacles, as it is written, and <I>offered</I> the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance as the duty of every day required;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And afterward <I>they offered</I> the continual burnt offering and <I>the offerings</I> of the new moons and of all the appointed feasts of Jehovah that were sanctified and of everyone who offered willingly a freewill offering to Jehovah.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah;<BR> 

however the foundation of the temple of Jehovah had not yet been laid.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> They also gave money to the stone hewers and to the carpenters, and food and drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa according to the authorization granted them by Cyrus the king of Persia.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Now in the second year after they came to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all those who came out of captivity to Jerusalem began by appointing the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have oversight over the work of the house of Jehovah.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jeshua stood <I>with</I> his sons and his brothers, as one man, <I>with</I> Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, <I>and with</I> the sons of Henadad <I>and</I> their sons and their brothers the Levites, to have oversight over the workmen in the house of God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah according to the directions of David the king of Israel.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And they sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah, <I>saying,</I> For He is good, for His lovingkindness is forever upon Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ <I>houses,</I> the old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes; and many shouted aloud for joy,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> So that the people could not discern the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.<BR>
