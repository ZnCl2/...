</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:1">50:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The word which Jehovah spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:2">50:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Declare among the nations and proclaim; / Lift up a banner, proclaim <I>it.</I> / Do not conceal <I>it, but</I> say, / Babylon is captured; / Bel is put to shame; / Merodach is shattered; / Her images are put to shame; / Her idols are dismayed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:3">50:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For a nation has come up against her from the north; / It will make her land a waste, / And there will be no inhabitant in it; / Both man and beast have fled; they are gone away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:4">50:4 &nbsp;</A></B> In those days and at that time, declares Jehovah, / The children of Israel will come, / <I>Both</I> they and the children of Judah together; / They will go along with weeping as they go, / And they will seek Jehovah their God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:5">50:5 &nbsp;</A></B> They will ask for the way to Zion / With their faces toward it, <I>saying:</I> / Come and let us join ourselves to Jehovah / In an eternal covenant that will not be forgotten.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:6">50:6 &nbsp;</A></B> My people are lost sheep; / Their shepherds have led them astray; / They have made them turn aside on the mountains; / They have gone from mountain to hill; / They have forgotten their resting place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:7">50:7 &nbsp;</A></B> All who found them have devoured them, / And their adversaries have said, We are not guilty, / Because they have sinned against Jehovah, / The habitation of righteousness, / Even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:8">50:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Flee from the midst of Babylon, / And go out from the land of the Chaldeans, / And be as male goats / Before the flock.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:9">50:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For I am about to stir up and bring up against Babylon / An assembly of great nations from the land of the north; / And they will set themselves in array against her, / And she will be taken captive from there. / Their arrows will be like those of an expert mighty man; / None will return empty-handed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:10">50:10&nbsp;</A></B> And Chaldea will become spoil; / All those who spoil her will be satisfied, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:11">50:11&nbsp;</A></B> Because you rejoiced, because you exulted, / O you who plunder My inheritance, / Because you spring about as a threshing heifer, / And you neigh like stallions,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:12">50:12&nbsp;</A></B> Your mother has been greatly ashamed; / She who bore you has become a reproach: / Indeed, she has become the last of the nations, / A wilderness, a dry land and a desert.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:13">50:13&nbsp;</A></B> Because of the wrath of Jehovah she will not be inhabited, / But she will become a complete desolation; / For every one who passes by Babylon will be astonished / And will hiss at all her wounds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:14">50:14&nbsp;</A></B> Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around, / All those who bend the bow; / Shoot at her; spare no arrow; / Because she has sinned against Jehovah;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:15">50:15&nbsp;</A></B> Raise a shout against her all around. / She has surrendered; her buttresses have fallen, / Her walls have been torn down; / For this is the vengeance of Jehovah: / Take vengeance on her; / As she has done, so do to her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:16">50:16&nbsp;</A></B> Cut off the sower from Babylon, / And the one who handles a sickle in the time of harvest;<BR>
Because of the sword of the oppressor / Each one will turn to his people, / And each one flee to his own land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:17">50:17&nbsp;</A></B> Israel is a scattered sheep; / Lions have driven <I>him</I> away.<BR>
First the king of Assyria devoured him, and last this Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has gnawed his bones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:18">50:18&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I punished the king of Assyria.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:19">50:19&nbsp;</A></B> And I will bring Israel back to his habitation, / And he will feed on Carmel and Bashan, / And in the hill country of Ephraim and in Gilead / He will satisfy his soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:20">50:20&nbsp;</A></B> In those days and at that time, declares Jehovah, / The iniquity of Israel will be sought, but there will be none; / And the sin of Judah, but it will not be found; / For I will forgive those whom I will leave as a remnant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:21">50:21&nbsp;</A></B> Go up against her, against the land of Merathaim / And against the inhabitants of Pekod. / Desolate and utterly destroy them, declares Jehovah, / And do according to all that I commanded you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:22">50:22&nbsp;</A></B> The sound of war is in the land, / And great destruction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:23">50:23&nbsp;</A></B> How the hammer of the whole earth / Is cut down and broken! / How Babylon has become an astonishment / Among the nations!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:24">50:24&nbsp;</A></B> I have set a snare for you, and you also have been taken captive, / O Babylon, and you did not know; / You were found, and you also were seized, / Because you engaged in war with Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:25">50:25&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah has opened His armory / And has brought out the weapons of His wrath, / For this is the work of the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Against the land of the Chaldeans.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:26">50:26&nbsp;</A></B> Come against her from every side; / Open her granaries. / Pile her up like heaps; / Destroy her utterly; / Let nothing of her remain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:27">50:27&nbsp;</A></B> Slay all her oxen; / Let them go down to slaughter.<BR>
Woe to them, for their day has come, / The time of their punishment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:28">50:28&nbsp;</A></B> There is a sound of those who flee and escape / From the land of Babylon, / To declare in Zion / The vengeance of Jehovah our God, / The vengeance for His temple.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:29">50:29&nbsp;</A></B> Summon archers against Babylon, / All those who bend the bow. / Encamp against her all around; / Let there be no escape. / Recompense her according to her work; / According to all that she has done, so do to her. / For she has acted proudly against Jehovah, / Against the Holy One of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:30">50:30&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore her young men will fall in her open squares, / And all her men of war will be silenced in that day, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:31">50:31&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I am against you, O Pride, / Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts; / For your day has come, / The time that I punish you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:32">50:32&nbsp;</A></B> And Pride will stumble and fall, / And there will be no one to raise him up. / And I will kindle a fire in his cities, / And it will devour all that is around him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:33">50:33&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, / The children of Israel / And the children of Judah are oppressed together; / And all who took them captive held them fast; / They refused to let them go.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:34">50:34&nbsp;</A></B> Their Redeemer is strong; / Jehovah of hosts is His name. / He will surely plead their cause, / That He may give rest to the land / But trouble to the inhabitants of Babylon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:35">50:35&nbsp;</A></B> The sword is against the Chaldeans, declares Jehovah, / And against the inhabitants of Babylon / And against her princes and against her wise men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:36">50:36&nbsp;</A></B> The sword is against the liars, and they will become fools; / The sword is against her mighty men, and they will be dismayed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:37">50:37&nbsp;</A></B> The sword is against their horses and against their chariots / And against all the mingled people who are in her midst, / And they will become <I>like</I> women. / The sword is against her treasuries, / And they will be plundered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:38">50:38&nbsp;</A></B> Drought is upon her waters, / And they will dry up; / For it is a land of graven images, / And they are mad over terrifying idols.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:39">50:39&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore desert animals will dwell there with hyenas, / And ostriches will dwell in her. / It will not be inhabited forever; / It will not be dwelt in from generation to generation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:40">50:40&nbsp;</A></B> As when God overthrew Sodom / And Gomorrah with its neighbors, / Declares Jehovah, / So no one will dwell there; / Nor will a son of man sojourn in it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:41">50:41&nbsp;</A></B> A people is now coming from the north, / And a great nation and many kings / Are stirring from the uttermost parts of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:42">50:42&nbsp;</A></B> They grasp bow and spear; / They are cruel and have no mercy. / Their voice roars like the sea, / And they ride upon horses, / Set in array as a man for battle / Against you, O daughter of Babylon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:43">50:43&nbsp;</A></B> The king of Babylon has heard the report about them, / And his hands are feeble; / Distress has seized him, / Pain like a woman in childbirth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:44">50:44&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, one will come up like a lion / From the majesty of the Jordan against a secure habitation; / For I will suddenly make them run away from her; / And whoever is chosen I will appoint over her. / For who is like Me? And who can appoint Me a time? / And who is that shepherd who can stand before Me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:45">50:45&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah, / Which He purposed against Babylon, / And His thoughts, which He has thought / Against the land of the Chaldeans: / Surely they will drag them off, the little ones of the flock; / Surely He will make <I>their</I> habitation a desolation because of them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:46">50:46&nbsp;</A></B> At the sound of Babylon being seized / The earth trembles, / And a cry is heard among the nations.<BR>
