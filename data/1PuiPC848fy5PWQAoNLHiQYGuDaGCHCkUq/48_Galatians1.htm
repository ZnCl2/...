</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Which is not another <I>gospel,</I> only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But if even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> As we have said before, now also I say again, If anyone announces to you a gospel beyond that which you have received, let him be accursed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For am I now trying to win the assent of men or of God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a slave of Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For I make known to you, brothers, <I>concerning</I> the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught <I>it,</I> but <I>I</I> <I>received it</I> through a revelation by Jesus Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and again returned to Damascus.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:18">&nbsp;1:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and I remained with him fifteen days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:19">&nbsp;1:19 &nbsp;</A></B> But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:20">&nbsp;1:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Now concerning the things which I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:21">&nbsp;1:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:22">&nbsp;1:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which are in Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:23">&nbsp;1:23 &nbsp;</A></B> But they only heard <I>this:</I> He who was formerly persecuting us is now announcing as the gospel the faith which formerly he ravaged.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:24">&nbsp;1:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And they glorified God because of me.<BR>
