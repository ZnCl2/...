</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:1">56:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / Preserve justice and do righteousness, / For My salvation is about to come / And My righteousness <I>is about</I> to be revealed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:2">56:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Blessed is the man who does this, / And the son of man who takes hold of it, / Who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it / And keeps his hand from doing any evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:3">56:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And let not the son of a foreigner / Who has joined himself to Jehovah speak, saying, / Jehovah will surely separate me from His people; / Nor let the eunuch say, / Now I am a dry tree.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:4">56:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths / And choose what pleases Me, / And hold fast My covenant,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:5">56:5 &nbsp;</A></B> To them I will give in My house and within My walls a memorial and a name / Better than that of sons and daughters; / I will give them an eternal name / Which will not be cut off.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:6">56:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Also the children of the foreigner who join themselves to Jehovah, / To minister to Him and to love the name of Jehovah, / To be servants to Him, / Everyone who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it / And holds fast My covenant,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:7">56:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Even these will I cause to come to My holy mountain / And to rejoice in My house of prayer; / Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable upon My altar; / For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:8">56:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord Jehovah, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, declares: / Yet will I gather <I>others</I> to Him besides those gathered to Him <I>already.</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:9">56:9 &nbsp;</A></B> All you animals of the field, come to eat, / All you animals of the forest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:10">56:10&nbsp;</A></B> His watchmen are blind; / All of them know nothing; / All of them are dumb dogs, / They cannot bark; / Dreamers who lie down / <I>And</I> love to slumber.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:11">56:11&nbsp;</A></B> And these dogs are greedy; / They know no satisfaction. / And they are shepherds / <I>Who</I> lack understanding. / All of them have turned to their own way, / Each to his own gain, to the last of them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="56:12">56:12&nbsp;</A></B> Come, <I>they say,</I> let me get some wine, / And let us drink down some liquor; / And tomorrow will be like today, / <I>Only</I> much more abundant.<BR>
