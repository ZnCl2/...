</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Let me sing of my Beloved, / A song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. / My Beloved had a vineyard / On a fertile hill.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And He dug it up and cleared away its stones, / And He planted it with the choicest vine. / Then He built a tower in the middle of it, / And hewed out a wine vat in it. / And He looked for it to produce grapes, / But it produced <I>only</I> wild grapes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> So then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem / And you men of Judah, / Judge between Me / And My vineyard.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> What more could I have done for My vineyard / That I have not <I>already</I> done for it? / Why then, when I looked for it to produce grapes, / Did it produce <I>only</I> wild grapes?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And now I will make known to you / What I will now do to My vineyard: / I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; / I will break down its wall, and it will become a trampled place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will make it a waste; / It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed; / But thorns and thistles will come <I>on it.</I> / And I will command the clouds / Not to rain upon it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, / And the men of Judah, the plant of His good pleasure; / And He expected justice, but instead, bloodshed! / <I>He expected</I> righteousness, but instead, an outcry of distress!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who join house to house, / Who lay field to field, / Till there is no place left, / And you dwell alone in the midst of the land!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> In my ears Jehovah of hosts <I>has sworn:</I> / Many houses shall indeed become desolate; / Great ones and fine ones <I>shall be</I> without inhabitants.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For ten acres of vineyard will produce a <I>mere</I> bath <I>of wine,</I> / And a homer of seed will produce an ephah <I>of grain.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who rise early in the morning / That they may run after liquor, / To those who linger into the evening / That wine may inflame them!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Lyre and harp, tambourine and flute, / And wine are <I>the essence of</I> their banquets; / And they do not consider what has been done by Jehovah, / Nor do they regard the work of His hands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Hence, my people go into exile / For lack of knowledge; / Their nobility <I>become</I> famished men, / And their multitudes, parched with thirst.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Hence, Sheol enlarges its appetite / And opens its mouth wide, without limit, / And <I>Jerusalem’s</I> splendor descends, and her din / And her uproar and the jubilant within her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased; / And the eyes of the haughty are abased;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> But Jehovah of hosts is exalted in judgment, / And the holy God shows Himself holy in righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:17">&nbsp;5:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Then lambs will graze <I>there</I> as in their pasture, / And strangers will eat the wastelands of fat men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:18">&nbsp;5:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who draw iniquity with ropes of vanity, / And sin as with cart ropes;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:19">&nbsp;5:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Who say, He should hurry up; / He should hasten His work, / So that we may see <I>it;</I> / And the counsel of the Holy One of Israel / Should draw near and happen, / So that we may know <I>it!</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:20">&nbsp;5:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who call evil good, / And good evil; / Who put darkness for light, / And light for darkness; / Who put bitter for sweet, / And sweet for bitter!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:21">&nbsp;5:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, / And prudent in their own sight!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:22">&nbsp;5:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine, / And men of valor in mixing liquor;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:23">&nbsp;5:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Who acquit the criminal as a result of a bribe, / But refuse righteousness to the righteous!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:24">&nbsp;5:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore as a tongue of fire consumes the stubble, / And the chaff sinks in flames, / Their root will be like decay, / And their bud will disappear like dust; / For they have rejected the instruction of Jehovah of hosts / And despised the speaking of the Holy One of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:25">&nbsp;5:25 &nbsp;</A></B> For this reason the anger of Jehovah burns against His people, / And He stretches out His hand over them and strikes them. / And the mountains quake, and their corpses are / Like garbage in the middle of the street. / In spite of all this His anger is not turned away; / Rather, His hand is still stretched out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:26">&nbsp;5:26 &nbsp;</A></B> He also lifts up a standard to a distant nation, / And whistles to it from the ends of the earth; / And indeed it comes with swift speed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:27">&nbsp;5:27 &nbsp;</A></B> None <I>of them</I> is weary, and none stumbles among them; / No one slumbers or sleeps; / And their belts are not loosened at their waists, / Nor are their sandal thongs broken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:28">&nbsp;5:28 &nbsp;</A></B> The arrows of these are sharpened, / And all their bows are drawn; / The hooves of their horses are considered to be like flint, / And their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:29">&nbsp;5:29 &nbsp;</A></B> Their roar is like a lion’s, / And they roar like young lions; / When they growl and seize prey, / They carry <I>it</I> away safe, and there is none to rescue <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:30">&nbsp;5:30 &nbsp;</A></B> And they will growl over it in that day, / Like the roaring of the sea. / When one will look upon the land, indeed, there will be darkness <I>and</I> distress, / And the light will be darkened with its clouds.<BR>
