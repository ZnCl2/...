</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:1">64:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Oh that You would rend the heavens, that You would come down&nbsp;— / That the mountains would shake at Your presence&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:2">64:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Like fire that kindles brushwood, / <I>Like</I> fire that causes water to boil, / To make Your name known to Your adversaries, / <I>That</I> the nations may tremble at Your presence!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:3">64:3 &nbsp;</A></B> When You did awesome things that we did not expect, / You came down, the mountains shook at Your presence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:4">64:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For from of old, <I>men</I> have not heard, / Nor perceived with the ear, / Neither has eye seen a God besides You, / Who acts for him who waits for Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:5">64:5 &nbsp;</A></B> You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, / Those who remember You in Your ways. / Yes, You were angry, for we sinned; / <I>We have been</I> in them for a long time, and shall we be saved?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:6">64:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For all of us became like him who is unclean, / And all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment; / And we all wither like a leaf, / And our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:7">64:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And there is no one who calls upon Your name, / Who stirs himself up to lay hold of You; / For You have hidden Your face from us / And have consumed us by our iniquities.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:8">64:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But now, Jehovah, You are our Father; / We are the clay; and You, our Potter; / And all of us are the work of Your hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:9">64:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be angry to an extreme, O Jehovah, / Neither remember iniquity forever; / Look now, we pray: We all are Your people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:10">64:10&nbsp;</A></B> Your holy cities have become a wilderness; / Zion is a wilderness, / Jerusalem a desolation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:11">64:11&nbsp;</A></B> Our holy and beautiful house, / Where our fathers praised You, / Is burned with fire; / And all the things that we delighted in have become a ruin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="64:12">64:12&nbsp;</A></B> Will You restrain Yourself from these, O Jehovah? / Will You keep silent and afflict us to an extreme?<BR>
