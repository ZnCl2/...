</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:1">13:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden concerning Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:2">13:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Upon a bare mountain raise up a standard; / Lift up <I>your</I> voice to them. / Wave <I>your</I> hand that they may enter / The gates of the nobles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:3">13:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I Myself have commanded My sanctified ones; / I have also called My mighty ones to My wrath, / Those who exult in My majesty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:4">13:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The sound of a tumult in the mountains, / Like that of many peoples! / The sound of an uproar of the kingdoms, / Of nations gathered together! / Jehovah of hosts is mustering / An army for battle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:5">13:5 &nbsp;</A></B> They are coming from a distant land, / From the ends of heaven&nbsp;— / Jehovah and the instruments of His indignation&nbsp;— / To ruin all the land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:6">13:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Howl, for the day of Jehovah has drawn near! / As destruction from the Almighty, it will come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:7">13:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of this all the hands will drop, / And every human heart will melt;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:8">13:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And <I>people</I> will be dismayed. / Pangs and anguish will seize them; / Like a woman giving birth, they will writhe. / Each man will look toward his neighbor dumbfounded; / Their faces are inflamed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:9">13:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Now the day of Jehovah is coming&nbsp;— / Cruel and <I>with</I> overflowing wrath and burning anger&nbsp;— / To make the land a desolation; / And He will destroy its sinners off of it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:10">13:10&nbsp;</A></B> For the stars of heaven and their constellations / Will not shine forth their light; / The sun will be dark at its rising, / And the moon will not let its light shine.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:11">13:11&nbsp;</A></B> And I will punish the world for <I>its</I> evil, / And the wicked for their iniquity; / I will stop the arrogance of the proud, / And the haughtiness of the terrible I will abase.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:12">13:12&nbsp;</A></B> I will make mortal man rarer than pure gold, / And mankind <I>rarer</I> than the gold of Ophir.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:13">13:13&nbsp;</A></B> Hence, I will make the heavens shake, / And the earth will quake out of its place, / At the overflowing wrath of Jehovah of hosts, / In the day of His burning anger.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:14">13:14&nbsp;</A></B> And like the hunted gazelle / And sheep without someone to gather <I>them,</I> / Each man will turn to his own people, / And each will flee to his own land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:15">13:15&nbsp;</A></B> Everyone found will be pierced through, / And everyone caught will fall by the sword.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:16">13:16&nbsp;</A></B> And their little ones will be dashed to pieces / Before their eyes; / Their houses will be plundered, / And their wives will be attacked.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:17">13:17&nbsp;</A></B> Now I rouse up the Medes against them, / Who will not esteem silver highly, / Nor take delight in gold.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:18">13:18&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Their</I> bows will shatter the young men; / And they will not have compassion on the fruit of the womb: / Their eyes will have no pity on children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:19">13:19&nbsp;</A></B> And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, / The glory of the Chaldeans’ majesty, / Will be as when God overthrew / Sodom and Gomorrah:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:20">13:20&nbsp;</A></B> It will not be inhabited forever; / It will not be dwelt in from generation to generation. / And the Arab will not set up his tent there, / Nor will the shepherds make <I>their flocks</I> lie down there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:21">13:21&nbsp;</A></B> But desert animals will lie down there, / And their houses will be full of wild dogs; / There ostriches will dwell, / And wild goats will prance there;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:22">13:22&nbsp;</A></B> Hyenas will respond in their citadels, / And jackals in <I>their</I> exquisite palaces. / Her time is about to come, / And her days will not be prolonged.<BR>
