</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Say to your brothers, Ammi, / And to your sisters, Ruhamah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Contend with your mother; contend. / For she is not my wife, / And I am not her husband. / And let her turn away her harlotries from her face, / And her adulteries from between her breasts,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Lest I strip her naked / And set her out as in the day she was born / And make her a wilderness / And make her a dry land / And slay her with thirst.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And on her children I will not have compassion, / For they are the children of harlotries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For their mother has gone about as a harlot; / She who conceived them has acted shamefully; / For she has said, / I will go after my lovers, / Who give <I>me</I> my bread and my water, / My wool and my flax, / My oil and my drink.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I will now hedge up / Her way with thorns; / And I will build up a wall against her, / So that she will not find her paths.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And she will pursue her lovers / But will not overtake them; / And she will seek them but not find <I>them;</I> / And she will say, I will go / And return to my first husband, / For it was better for me then than now.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For she did not know / That it was I who gave her / The grain and the new wine and the fresh oil, / And who multiplied to her silver / And gold, which they used for Baal.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I will take back / My grain in its time / And My new wine in its appointed season, / And I will snatch away My wool and My flax, / <I>Which were</I> to cover her nakedness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And now I will uncover her lewdness / In the sight of her lovers, / And no one will deliver her from My hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will bring all her mirth to an end, / Her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, / And all her appointed assemblies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will desolate her vine and her fig tree, / Of which she said, / These are my payments / That my lovers have given me; / And I will make them a forest, / And the beasts of the field will devour them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will visit the days of the Baals upon her, / In which she burned incense to them / And adorned herself with her nose rings and her jewels / And went after her lovers / And forgot Me, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I am now luring her, / And I will bring her into the wilderness / And will speak to her heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will give her her vineyards from there / And the valley of Achor as a door of hope; / And she will respond there as in the days of her youth / And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And in that day, declares Jehovah, / You will call <I>Me</I> My Husband / And will no longer call Me Baali.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> For I will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth, / And they will no longer be remembered by their name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:18">&nbsp;2:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will make a covenant for them / In that day / With the beasts of the field / And with the birds of heaven / And the creeping things of the earth; / And bow and sword and battle / I will break from the land, / And I will cause them to lie down in safety.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:19">&nbsp;2:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will betroth you to Myself forever; / Indeed I will betroth you to Myself / In righteousness and justice / And in lovingkindness and compassions;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:20">&nbsp;2:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed I will betroth you to Myself in faithfulness, / And you will know Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:21">&nbsp;2:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And in that day / I will answer, declares Jehovah; / I will answer the heavens, / And they will answer the earth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:22">&nbsp;2:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And the earth will answer the grain / And the new wine and the fresh oil, / And they will answer Jezreel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:23">&nbsp;2:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will sow her for Myself in the land; / And I will have compassion on Lo-ruhamah, / And I will say to Lo-ammi, You are My people; / And they will say, My God.<BR>
