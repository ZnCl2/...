</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For if there comes into your synagogue a man with gold rings in splendid clothing, and there also comes in a poor man in filthy clothing,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And you look upon the one wearing the splendid clothing and say, You sit here in a good place, and to the poor man you say, You stand there, or sit under my footstool;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil reasonings?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world <I>to be</I> rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But you have dishonored the poor. <I>Is it</I> not the rich <I>who</I> oppress you and <I>is it not</I> they <I>who</I> drag you to the courts?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Is it</I> not they <I>who</I> blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But if you respect persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one <I>point</I> has become guilty of all.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> So speak and so do as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And any one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do not give them the necessities of the body, what is the profit?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:18">&nbsp;2:18 &nbsp;</A></B> But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:19">&nbsp;2:19 &nbsp;</A></B> You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:20">&nbsp;2:20 &nbsp;</A></B> But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is useless?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:21">&nbsp;2:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:22">&nbsp;2:22 &nbsp;</A></B> You see that faith worked together with his works, and by these works faith was perfected.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:23">&nbsp;2:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”; and he was called the friend of God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:24">&nbsp;2:24 &nbsp;</A></B> You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:25">&nbsp;2:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works in that she received the messengers and sent <I>them</I> out by a different way?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:26">&nbsp;2:26 &nbsp;</A></B> For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.<BR>
