</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:1">46:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Bel has bowed down; Nebo stoops; / Their idols are on beasts and cattle; / The things which you carry are a burden, / A load for a weary <I>beast.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:2">46:2 &nbsp;</A></B> They stoop and have bowed down together; / They are not able to escape the burden; / But they themselves have gone into captivity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:3">46:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, / And all the remnant of the house of Israel, / <I>You</I> who have been borne from birth, / Who have been carried from the womb,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:4">46:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Even unto old age, I am He; / Even unto <I>your</I> gray-haired <I>years,</I> I will bear <I>you.</I> / I have made and I will carry, / And I will bear and deliver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:5">46:5 &nbsp;</A></B> To whom will you liken Me, / And <I>with whom</I> will you make <I>Me</I> equal / And compare Me, that we should be <I>considered</I> alike?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:6">46:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Those who lavish gold from the purse / And weigh silver in scales / And hire a goldsmith, and he makes a god&nbsp;— / They bow down <I>and</I> even worship <I>it;</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:7">46:7 &nbsp;</A></B> They lift it up on their shoulder; they carry it / And set it in its place and stand <I>it</I> up. / It will not move from its place; / <I>Someone</I> even cries out to it, and it does not answer, / Nor save <I>him</I> from his distress.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:8">46:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember this and stand fast; / Put this in your heart, O transgressors.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:9">46:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember the former things of old, / That I am God and there is no one else; / I am God and there is no one like Me,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:10">46:10&nbsp;</A></B> Who declares the end from the beginning / And things which have not been done from ancient times, / Saying, My counsel will stand, / And all My desire I will accomplish;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:11">46:11&nbsp;</A></B> Who calls <I>for</I> a bird of prey from the east, / And from a distant land a man <I>to be</I> My counselor. / Indeed, I have spoken; surely I will bring it to pass. / I have purposed; surely I will do it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:12">46:12&nbsp;</A></B> Listen to Me, O hardhearted ones, / <I>Who are</I> far from righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="46:13">46:13&nbsp;</A></B> I will bring My righteousness near&nbsp;— it is not far off; / And My salvation will not delay; / And I will give salvation in Zion, / <I>And</I> to Israel My glory.<BR>
