</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:1">&nbsp;8:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Who is like the wise man? And who knows the interpretation of a matter? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, and the sternness of his face is changed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:2">&nbsp;8:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I <I>say,</I> Keep the commandment of the king, and <I>that,</I> because of the oath before God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:3">&nbsp;8:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not hurry to leave him; do not join in an evil matter, for he will do whatever he pleases.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:4">&nbsp;8:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For the king’s word is powerful, and who will say to him, What are you doing?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:5">&nbsp;8:5 &nbsp;</A></B> He who keeps the commandment will know nothing evil, and a wise man’s heart will know the proper time and manner.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:6">&nbsp;8:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For there is a proper time and manner for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy upon him;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:7">&nbsp;8:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For he does not know what will be, for who can tell him how it will be?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:8">&nbsp;8:8 &nbsp;</A></B> There is no man who has power over his breath to retain his breath, and no one has power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in the battle, nor will wickedness deliver its own master.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:9">&nbsp;8:9 &nbsp;</A></B> All this I have seen, and I applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun when a man overpowers <I>another</I> man to his hurt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:10">&nbsp;8:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And then I saw the wicked buried, who <I>before</I> had gone in and come forth from the holy place and were forgotten in the city where they had thus acted. This also is vanity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:11">&nbsp;8:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set within them to do evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:12">&nbsp;8:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his <I>life,</I> yet I also know that it will be well with the God-fearing who are in fear before Him;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:13">&nbsp;8:13 &nbsp;</A></B> But it will not be well with the wicked man, nor will he prolong his days like a shadow, because he is not in fear before God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:14">&nbsp;8:14 &nbsp;</A></B> There is a vanity that is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom <I>things</I> happen according to the deeds of the wicked and there are wicked men to whom <I>things</I> happen according to the deeds of the righteous. I say that this also is vanity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:15">&nbsp;8:15 &nbsp;</A></B> So I praised pleasure, because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and to drink and to rejoice; for that will stay with him in his labor during the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:16">&nbsp;8:16 &nbsp;</A></B> When I set my heart to know wisdom and to see the travail that is done on the earth (even though man’s eyes do not see sleep day or night),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:17">&nbsp;8:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I saw every work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun, because however man labors to seek <I>it</I> out, he will not find <I>it</I> out; and even if the wise man says that he will come to know <I>it,</I> he is not able to find <I>it</I> out.<BR>
