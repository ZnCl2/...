</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:1">14:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual <I>gifts,</I> but especially that you may prophesy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:2">14:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one hears, but in <I>his</I> spirit he speaks mysteries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:3">14:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But he who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:4">14:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:5">14:5 &nbsp;</A></B> I desire that you all speak in tongues, but especially that you would prophesy; and greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:6">14:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:7">14:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet <I>even</I> lifeless things, whether flute or harp, in giving a sound, if they give no distinction in the tones, how will what is played on the flute or on the harp be known?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:8">14:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For also if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:9">14:9 &nbsp;</A></B> So also you, unless you give with the tongue a word easy to understand, how will what is being said be known? For you will be speaking into the air.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:10">14:10&nbsp;</A></B> There are perhaps many kinds of voices in the world, and not one is without significance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:11">14:11&nbsp;</A></B> If then I do not know the meaning of the voice, I will be to him who is speaking a barbarian, and he who is speaking a barbarian to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:12">14:12&nbsp;</A></B> So also you, since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:13">14:13&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:14">14:14&nbsp;</A></B> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:15">14:15&nbsp;</A></B> What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing also with the mind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:16">14:16&nbsp;</A></B> Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the unlearned <I>in tongues</I> say the Amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:17">14:17&nbsp;</A></B> For you give thanks well, but the other is not built up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:18">14:18&nbsp;</A></B> I thank God, I speak in tongues more than all of you,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:19">14:19&nbsp;</A></B> But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:20">14:20&nbsp;</A></B> Brothers, do not be children in your understanding, but in malice be babes and in <I>your</I> understanding be full-grown.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:21">14:21&nbsp;</A></B> In the law it is written, “By those of other tongues and with the lips of others I will speak to this people; even so they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:22">14:22&nbsp;</A></B> So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to the unbelievers; but prophecy <I>is for a sign</I> not to the unbelievers but to those who believe.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:23">14:23&nbsp;</A></B> If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and some unlearned <I>in tongues</I> or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:24">14:24&nbsp;</A></B> But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is examined by all;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:25">14:25&nbsp;</A></B> The secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on <I>his</I> face, he will worship God, declaring that indeed God is among you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:26">14:26&nbsp;</A></B> What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:27">14:27&nbsp;</A></B> If anyone speaks in a tongue, <I>it should be</I> by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and one should interpret;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:28">14:28&nbsp;</A></B> But if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church, and speak to himself and to God.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:29">14:29&nbsp;</A></B> And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:30">14:30&nbsp;</A></B> But if <I>something</I> is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:31">14:31&nbsp;</A></B> For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:32">14:32&nbsp;</A></B> And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:33">14:33&nbsp;</A></B> For God is not <I>a God</I> of confusion but of peace.<BR>

As in all the churches of the saints,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:34">14:34&nbsp;</A></B> The women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they should be subject, even as the law also says.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:35">14:35&nbsp;</A></B> But if they desire to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:36">14:36&nbsp;</A></B> Or <I>was it</I> from you <I>that</I> the word of God went forth? Or did it reach only to you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:37">14:37&nbsp;</A></B> If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him fully know the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:38">14:38&nbsp;</A></B> But if anyone ignores <I>this,</I> let him ignore <I>it.</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:39">14:39&nbsp;</A></B> So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying, and do not forbid the speaking in tongues.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:40">14:40&nbsp;</A></B> But all things must be done becomingly and in order.<BR>
