</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:1">32:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah the king of Judah. That year was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:2">32:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:3">32:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For Zedekiah the king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I am about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:4">32:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Zedekiah the king of Judah will not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon and will speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes will see his eyes;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:5">32:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him, declares Jehovah; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you will not prosper?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:6">32:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:7">32:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field which is in Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:8">32:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Hanamel, my uncle’s son, came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah and said to me, Buy my field which is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin, for you have the right of possession, and the <I>right of</I> redemption is yours; buy <I>it</I> for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:9">32:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And I bought the field which was in Anathoth from Hanamel, my uncle’s son, and I weighed out for him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:10">32:10&nbsp;</A></B> And I signed and sealed the deed and called witnesses and weighed out the money on scales.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:11">32:11&nbsp;</A></B> Then I took the deed of purchase, the sealed part, <I>containing</I> the terms and conditions, and the open part;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:12">32:12&nbsp;</A></B> And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel, my uncle’s <I>son,</I> and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, before all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:13">32:13&nbsp;</A></B> And I commanded Baruch in their presence, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:14">32:14&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Take these deeds, this deed of purchase, both the one which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel that they may remain many days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:15">32:15&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:16">32:16&nbsp;</A></B> And after I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:17">32:17&nbsp;</A></B> Ah, Lord Jehovah! It is You who have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm. Nothing is too wonderful for You,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:18">32:18&nbsp;</A></B> Who show lovingkindness to thousands <I>of generations</I> but repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them. O great and mighty God, whose name is Jehovah of hosts,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:19">32:19&nbsp;</A></B> Great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, giving to each according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:20">32:20&nbsp;</A></B> Who have set signs and wonders unto this day in the land of Egypt and in Israel and among mankind and have made a name for Yourself, as in this day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:21">32:21&nbsp;</A></B> And You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:22">32:22&nbsp;</A></B> And You gave them this land, which You had sworn to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:23">32:23&nbsp;</A></B> And they entered and took possession of it, but they did not listen to Your voice or walk in Your law. They have not done anything of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to happen to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:24">32:24&nbsp;</A></B> See the siege mounds, <I>which</I> come up to the city to capture it. And the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans, who are fighting against it, by sword and famine and pestilence. And what You have spoken has come to pass, even as You see it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:25">32:25&nbsp;</A></B> But You, O Lord Jehovah, said to me, Buy for yourself the field with money and call witnesses. Yet the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:26">32:26&nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:27">32:27&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh. Is anything too wonderful for Me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:28">32:28&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah, I am now giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and he will take it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:29">32:29&nbsp;</A></B> And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come and set this city on fire, and they will burn it and the houses upon whose roofs the people have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:30">32:30&nbsp;</A></B> For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger by the work of their hands, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:31">32:31&nbsp;</A></B> For this city has been to Me <I>a provocation</I> of My anger and of My wrath, from the day that they built it even unto this day, so that I should remove it from My sight;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:32">32:32&nbsp;</A></B> Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger&nbsp;— they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:33">32:33&nbsp;</A></B> And they have turned <I>their</I> back to Me and not <I>their</I> face, although I taught them, rising up early and teaching; but they would not listen so as to receive instruction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:34">32:34&nbsp;</A></B> And they set up their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:35">32:35&nbsp;</A></B> And they built the high places of Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom in order to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <I>fire</I> to Molech, something I did not command them <I>to do,</I> nor did it come up in My heart that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:36">32:36&nbsp;</A></B> And now therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Israel concerning this city of which you say, It has been given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword and by famine and by pestilence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:37">32:37&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I will gather them out from all the lands where I have driven them in My anger and in My wrath and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and make them dwell in safety.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:38">32:38&nbsp;</A></B> And they will be My people, and I will be their God;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:39">32:39&nbsp;</A></B> And I will give them one heart and one way, to fear Me all the days, for their own good and for <I>the good of</I> their children after them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:40">32:40&nbsp;</A></B> And I will make an eternal covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My fear into their hearts, so that they will not turn away from Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:41">32:41&nbsp;</A></B> And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all My heart and with all My soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:42">32:42&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promised them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:43">32:43&nbsp;</A></B> And fields will be bought in this land of which you are saying, It is a desolation, without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="32:44">32:44&nbsp;</A></B> They will buy fields with money and sign and seal deeds and call witnesses in the land of Benjamin and all around Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah and in the cities of the hill country and in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev, for I will turn their captivity, declares Jehovah.<BR>
