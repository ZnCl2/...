</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:1">17:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:2">17:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, This is what Jehovah has commanded, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:3">17:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Anyone of the house of Israel who slaughters an ox or a sheep or a goat within the camp, or who slaughters <I>it</I> outside the camp,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:4">17:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And has not brought it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to present <I>it</I> as an offering to Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah, that man shall be accounted as guilty of bloodshed. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:5">17:5 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>This is</I> so that the children of Israel will bring their sacrifices which they sacrifice in the open field, that they will bring them to Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to the priest and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:6">17:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Jehovah at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and burn the fat for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:7">17:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons, to whom they prostitute themselves. This shall become a perpetual statute for them throughout their generations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:8">17:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall say to them, Anyone of the house of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:9">17:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to Jehovah, that man shall be cut off from his people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:10">17:10&nbsp;</A></B> And anyone of the house of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn among them, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that person who eats blood and cut him off from among his people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:11">17:11&nbsp;</A></B> For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you to make expiation for your souls on the altar, for it is the blood, by reason of the life, that makes expiation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:12">17:12&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No person among you shall eat blood, nor shall any sojourner who sojourns among you eat blood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:13">17:13&nbsp;</A></B> And anyone of the children of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn among them, who in hunting takes an animal or bird that may be eaten, shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:14">17:14&nbsp;</A></B> For as to the life of all flesh, its blood is its very life; therefore I have said to the children of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:15">17:15&nbsp;</A></B> And every person who eats that which dies of itself or is torn <I>by beasts,</I> whether he is a native or a sojourner, shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening; then he shall be clean.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:16">17:16&nbsp;</A></B> But if he does not wash <I>them</I> or bathe his body, then he shall bear his iniquity.<BR>
