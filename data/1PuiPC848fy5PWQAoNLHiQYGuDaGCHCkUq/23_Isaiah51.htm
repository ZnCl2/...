</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:1">51:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness, / Who seek after Jehovah, / Look to the rock <I>from which</I> you were hewn, / And to the excavation of the quarry <I>from which</I> you were dug.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:2">51:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Look to Abraham your father, / And to Sarah who travailed with you; / For I called him <I>when he was</I> one <I>person,</I> / And blessed him and multiplied him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:3">51:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah has comforted Zion; / He has comforted all her waste places, / And made her wilderness like Eden, / And her desert like the garden of Jehovah. / Gladness and joy will be found in her, / Thanksgiving and the voice of song.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:4">51:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Hearken to Me, O My people; / Give ear to Me, O My nation; / For instruction will go out from Me; / And I will set My judgment as a light for the peoples.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:5">51:5 &nbsp;</A></B> My righteousness is near; My salvation has gone forth; / My arms will judge the peoples; / The coastlands will wait for Me / And place their hope in My arm.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:6">51:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, / And look upon the earth beneath; / For the heavens will vanish away like smoke, / And the earth will wear out like a garment, / And those who dwell there will die in like manner; / But My salvation will be forever, / And My righteousness will not be abolished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:7">51:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen to Me, you who know righteousness, / A people in whose heart is My instruction, / Do not fear the reproach of man; / Do not be terrified at their revilings.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:8">51:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For the moth will eat them up like a garment, / And the worm will eat them like wool; / But My righteousness will be forever, / And My salvation from generation to generation.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:9">51:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Awake, awake! Put on strength, / O arm of Jehovah; / Awake as in the days of old, / <I>As</I> in the generations of past ages. / Was it not You who cut Rahab in pieces, / Who pierced through the dragon?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:10">51:10&nbsp;</A></B> Was it not You who dried up the sea, / The waters of the great deep; / Who made the depths of the sea <I>into</I> a way / For the redeemed to pass through?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:11">51:11&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore the ransomed of Jehovah will return / And will come to Zion with a ringing shout, / And eternal joy will be upon their heads. / They will lay hold on gladness and joy, / And sorrow and sighing will flee away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:12">51:12&nbsp;</A></B> I, <I>even</I> I, am He who will comfort you. / Who are you that you are afraid of man who will die, / And of the son of man <I>who</I> will be made <I>like</I> grass,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:13">51:13&nbsp;</A></B> That you have forgotten Jehovah who made you, / Who stretched out the heavens / And laid the foundations of the earth, / That you have been continually afraid every day, / Because of the fury of the oppressor / When he sets himself up to destroy <I>you?</I> / But where is the fury of the oppressor?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:14">51:14&nbsp;</A></B> The one who is bowed down will soon be released / And will not die in the pit, / Nor will his bread be lacking.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:15">51:15&nbsp;</A></B> I am Jehovah your God, / Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar, / Jehovah of hosts is His name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:16">51:16&nbsp;</A></B> And I have put My words in your mouth, / And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand, / To plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, / And to say to Zion, You are My people.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:17">51:17&nbsp;</A></B> Wake yourself up, wake yourself up; / Stand up, O Jerusalem, / You who have drunk from the hand of Jehovah / The cup of His wrath; / The bowl of the cup of staggering / You have drunk; you have drained <I>it</I> out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:18">51:18&nbsp;</A></B> There is no one to guide her / Among all the children whom she has brought forth; / There is no one to take her by the hand / Among all the children she has raised up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:19">51:19&nbsp;</A></B> These two things have happened to you; / Who will lament for you? / Desolation and destruction, and famine and sword. / How will I comfort you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:20">51:20&nbsp;</A></B> Your sons have fainted; / They lie at the head of every street like an antelope in a net, / Full of the wrath of Jehovah, / The rebuke of your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:21">51:21&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore hear this now, O afflicted one, / You who are drunk but not with wine:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:22">51:22&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says your Lord Jehovah and your God / Who pleads the cause of His people, / Indeed, I have taken from your hand / The cup of staggering; / You will no longer need to drink / The bowl of the cup of My wrath anymore;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="51:23">51:23&nbsp;</A></B> And I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, / Who have said to your soul, Bow down / That we may walk over <I>you;</I> / And you have made your back like the ground, / Like the street for them to cross over.<BR>
