</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I do indeed know that it is so. / But how can a man be righteous before God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> If he is pleased to contend with Him, / He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He is wise in heart and mighty in strength&nbsp;— / Who has <I>ever</I> resisted Him and come through whole?&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> He who removes mountains, and they do not know <I>it,</I> / When He overturns them in His anger;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Who shakes the earth from its place, / And its pillars shake;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Who commands the sun, and it does not rise, / And seals up the stars;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Who alone stretched forth the heavens / And trod upon the heights of the sea;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Who made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, / And the chambers of the south;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Indeed, wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, He passes by me, but I do not see <I>Him;</I> / And He goes by, but I do not perceive Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, He snatches away; who can stop Him? / Who can say to Him, What are You doing?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> God does not turn back His anger; / Under Him Rahab’s helpers stoop.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> How then can I answer Him / And choose my words <I>properly</I> with Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> I, though righteous, could not answer <I>Him;</I> / I could <I>only</I> plead for mercy before my Judge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> If I called out and He answered me, / I do not believe that He would hearken to my voice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> For He crushes me with a whirlwind / And multiplies my wounds without cause.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:18">&nbsp;9:18 &nbsp;</A></B> He does not permit me to catch my breath, / But fills me with bitterness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:19">&nbsp;9:19 &nbsp;</A></B> If <I>we speak</I> of strength, indeed, <I>He is</I> mighty! / Or if of judgment, Who, <I>says He,</I> can appoint Me a time?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:20">&nbsp;9:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Though I am righteous, my mouth would condemn me; / Though I am perfect, it would prove me perverse.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:21">&nbsp;9:21 &nbsp;</A></B> I am perfect; I do not regard my soul; / I despise my life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:22">&nbsp;9:22 &nbsp;</A></B> It is <I>all</I> one; therefore I say, / He destroys the perfect and the wicked.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:23">&nbsp;9:23 &nbsp;</A></B> If some scourge suddenly kills, / He derides the despair of the innocent.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:24">&nbsp;9:24 &nbsp;</A></B> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; / He covers the faces of its judges. / If not <I>He,</I> then who is it?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:25">&nbsp;9:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And my days are swifter than a running messenger; / They flee away, they do not see good;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:26">&nbsp;9:26 &nbsp;</A></B> They go by like reed boats, / Like an eagle swooping on the prey.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:27">&nbsp;9:27 &nbsp;</A></B> If I say, I will forget my complaint, / I will put off my <I>sad</I> countenance and look cheerful;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:28">&nbsp;9:28 &nbsp;</A></B> I fear all my pains: / I know that You will not hold me innocent.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:29">&nbsp;9:29 &nbsp;</A></B> I will be accounted wicked; / Why then do I labor in vain?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:30">&nbsp;9:30 &nbsp;</A></B> If I wash myself with soap / And cleanse my hands with lye,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:31">&nbsp;9:31 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet You will plunge me into the pit, / And my own garments will abhor me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:32">&nbsp;9:32 &nbsp;</A></B> For <I>He is</I> not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, / That we should enter into litigation together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:33">&nbsp;9:33 &nbsp;</A></B> There is no referee between us, / Who may lay his hand upon us both.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:34">&nbsp;9:34 &nbsp;</A></B> Let Him take His rod away from me, / And let not the dread of Him terrify me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:35">&nbsp;9:35 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Then</I> I would speak and not be afraid; / For I am not such.<BR>
