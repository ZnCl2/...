</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:11">18:11&nbsp;</A></B> The rich man’s substance is his strong city / And like a high wall in his own imagination.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:12">18:12&nbsp;</A></B> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, / But humility <I>goes</I> before honor.<BR>
