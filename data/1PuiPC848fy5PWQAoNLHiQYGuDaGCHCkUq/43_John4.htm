</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> (Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but <I>rather</I> His disciples),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And He had to pass through Samaria.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me <I>something</I> to drink.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How <I>is it that</I> You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> The woman said to Him, Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> He said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> The woman answered and said, I do not have a husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I do not have a husband,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> For you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:20">&nbsp;4:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where <I>men</I> must worship.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:21">&nbsp;4:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:22">&nbsp;4:22 &nbsp;</A></B> You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:23">&nbsp;4:23 &nbsp;</A></B> But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:24">&nbsp;4:24 &nbsp;</A></B> God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:25">&nbsp;4:25 &nbsp;</A></B> The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:26">&nbsp;4:26 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to her, I, who speak to you, am <I>He.</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:27">&nbsp;4:27 &nbsp;</A></B> And at this <I>point</I> His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking? or, Why are You speaking with her?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:28">&nbsp;4:28 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:29">&nbsp;4:29 &nbsp;</A></B> Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:30">&nbsp;4:30 &nbsp;</A></B> They went out of the city and came to Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:31">&nbsp;4:31 &nbsp;</A></B> In the meantime, the disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:32">&nbsp;4:32 &nbsp;</A></B> But He said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:33">&nbsp;4:33 &nbsp;</A></B> The disciples therefore said to one another, Has anyone brought Him <I>anything</I> to eat?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:34">&nbsp;4:34 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:35">&nbsp;4:35 &nbsp;</A></B> Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:36">&nbsp;4:36 &nbsp;</A></B> He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:37">&nbsp;4:37 &nbsp;</A></B> For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:38">&nbsp;4:38 &nbsp;</A></B> I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:39">&nbsp;4:39 &nbsp;</A></B> And many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all that I have done.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:40">&nbsp;4:40 &nbsp;</A></B> So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them, and He remained there two days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:41">&nbsp;4:41 &nbsp;</A></B> And many more believed because of His word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:42">&nbsp;4:42 &nbsp;</A></B> And they said to the woman, <I>It is</I> no longer because of your speaking <I>that</I> we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this One is truly the Savior of the world.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:43">&nbsp;4:43 &nbsp;</A></B> And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:44">&nbsp;4:44 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:45">&nbsp;4:45 &nbsp;</A></B> Then when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:46">&nbsp;4:46 &nbsp;</A></B> He then came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine.<BR>

And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick in Capernaum.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:47">&nbsp;4:47 &nbsp;</A></B> When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked <I>Him</I> to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:48">&nbsp;4:48 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:49">&nbsp;4:49 &nbsp;</A></B> The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my little child dies.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:50">&nbsp;4:50 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:51">&nbsp;4:51 &nbsp;</A></B> And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and said that his child was living.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:52">&nbsp;4:52 &nbsp;</A></B> So he asked them the hour in which he got better. They said then to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:53">&nbsp;4:53 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the father knew that <I>it was</I> in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he believed, he and his whole house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:54">&nbsp;4:54 &nbsp;</A></B> Again, this second sign Jesus performed when He came out of Judea into Galilee.<BR>
