</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:1">27:1 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day Jehovah will punish, / With His harsh, great, and mighty sword, / Leviathan the fleeing serpent, / And leviathan the crooked serpent; / And He will slay the dragon that is in the sea.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:3">27:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I, Jehovah, am its keeper; / Every moment I water it. / Lest anyone visit harm upon it, / By night and by day I guard it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:4">27:4 &nbsp;</A></B> I have no wrath. / Oh that I had thorns <I>and</I> thistles! / In battle I would march against them; / I would burn them completely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:5">27:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Or let him grasp at My strength; / Let him make peace with Me; / Let him make peace with Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:6">27:6 &nbsp;</A></B> In the days to come Jacob will take root; / Israel will blossom and bud; / And they will fill the surface of the world with <I>their</I> produce.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:7">27:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Has He struck them like those who struck them? / Have they been slain like those slain by Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:8">27:8 &nbsp;</A></B> By expulsion <I>and</I> by banishing them, You contended with them; / He sent <I>them</I> away with His harsh wind in the day of the east wind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:9">27:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus by this the iniquity of Jacob will be expiated, / And this is all the fruit of the removal of their sin; / When they make all the stones of <I>their</I> altar / Like chalk stones beaten to powder&nbsp;— / Asherahs and sun images will not stand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:10">27:10&nbsp;</A></B> For the fortified city is isolated; / The habitation is given up and abandoned like a wilderness. / There the calf will feed, / And there he will lie down and consume its branches.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:11">27:11&nbsp;</A></B> When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off; / Women come <I>and</I> make a fire with them; / For they are not a people of understanding. / Therefore He who made them will not have compassion on them, / And He who formed them will not show favor to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:12">27:12&nbsp;</A></B> And in that day Jehovah will beat out <I>the</I> <I>grain</I> from the flowing stream of / the River / Unto the brook of Egypt; / And you will be gleaned / One by one, O you children of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:13">27:13&nbsp;</A></B> And in that day a great trumpet will be blown, / And the ones lost in the land of Assyria will come, / As well as the outcasts in the land of Egypt, / And they will worship Jehovah / On the holy mountain in Jerusalem.<BR>
