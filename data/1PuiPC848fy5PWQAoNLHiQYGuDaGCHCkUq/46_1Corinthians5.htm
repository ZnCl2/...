</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication that <I>does</I> not even <I>occur</I> among the Gentiles, that someone has his stepmother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And you are puffed up? And have you not rather mourned, that the one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened <I>bread</I> of sincerity and truth.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I wrote to you in my letter not to mingle with fornicators,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>But</I> not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to go out of the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> But now I have written to you not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For what have I to do with judging those who are outside <I>the church?</I> Do you not judge those who are within <I>the church?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> But those who are outside, God will judge. Remove the evil man from among yourselves.<BR>
