</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I saw the Lord standing upon the altar. And He said,<BR>
Strike the capitals <I>of the pillars</I> / That the thresholds may shake. / And break them off upon the heads of them all, / And the last of them I will slay with the sword: / Any one of them who flees will not flee away, / And any one of them who escapes will not slip by.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Though they dig into Sheol, / From there My hand will take them; / And though they go up into heaven, / From there I will bring them down.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And though they hide at the top of Carmel, / From there I will seek <I>them</I> and take them. / And though they hide themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea, / There I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And though they go into captivity before their enemies, / There I will command the sword, and it will slay them; / And I will set My eyes upon them / For evil and not for good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Is the One who touches the land and it melts, / And all those who dwell in it mourn; / And all of it rises like the River, / And it sinks like the river of Egypt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>He is</I> the One who builds His upper stories in the heavens / And has founded His vault over the earth; / <I>He is</I> the One who calls for the water of the sea / And pours it upon the surface of the earth; / Jehovah is His name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Are you not like the children of the Cushites / To Me, O children of Israel? / Declares Jehovah. / Have I not brought up Israel / Out from the land of Egypt, / And the Philistines out from Caphtor, / And Aram out from Kir?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Yes, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah / Are on the sinful kingdom, / And I will destroy it / From off the face of the earth, / Except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For I will command / And shake the house of Israel among all the nations, / As <I>grain</I> is shaken in the sieve; / Yet a kernel will not fall to the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> All the sinners of My people / Will die by the sword, / Those who say, Evil will not overtake us / Nor come before us on all sides.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day I will raise up / The fallen tabernacle of David, / And I will wall up its breaches / And raise up its ruins / And build it up as <I>it was</I> in the days of old;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> That they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations which are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed days are coming, / Declares Jehovah, / When the plowman will overtake the reaper, / And the grape treader, him who sows the seed; / And the mountains will drip sweet wine, / And all the hills will melt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel, / And they will build the desolated cities and inhabit <I>them;</I> / And they will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them, / And make gardens and eat the fruit from them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will plant them upon their land, and they will not be plucked up again from their land, which I have given to them, says Jehovah your God.<BR>
