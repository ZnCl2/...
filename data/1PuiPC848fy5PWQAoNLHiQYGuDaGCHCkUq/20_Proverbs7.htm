</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> My son, keep my words, / And treasure up my commandments within you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Keep my commandments, and live; / And my teaching, like the apple of your eye.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Bind them on your fingers; / Write them on the tablet of your heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Say to wisdom, You are my sister, / And call understanding <I>your</I> close friend,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> That they may keep you from the strange woman, / From the adulteress who flatters with her words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For at the window of my house / I looked out through my lattice,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And I saw among the simple ones, / I discerned among the youths, / A young man lacking sense,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Passing along the street near her corner; / And he takes the way to her house,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> In the twilight, in the evening of the day, / In the deep of night and darkness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And there <I>comes</I> a woman to meet him, / Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> She is rowdy and defiant; / Her feet do not stay at home&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Now in the street, now in the squares, / And at every corner she lies in wait.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And she grabs him and kisses him; / And with an impudent face she says to him,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> I had to make offerings; / Today I have paid my vows.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I have come out to meet you, / To earnestly seek your presence; and I have found you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> I have decked my couch with coverings, / Colored spreads of the linen of Egypt;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, / Aloes, and cinnamon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:18">&nbsp;7:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning; / Let us delight ourselves with love.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:19">&nbsp;7:19 &nbsp;</A></B> For my husband is not at home; / He has gone on a long journey.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:20">&nbsp;7:20 &nbsp;</A></B> He has taken the money bag with him; / He will come home at the full moon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:21">&nbsp;7:21 &nbsp;</A></B> With her great persuasiveness she beguiles him; / With her smooth talk she compels him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:22">&nbsp;7:22 &nbsp;</A></B> He goes after her immediately, / As an ox goes to the slaughter, / Or as <I>someone in</I> fetters, to the correction of the fool,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:23">&nbsp;7:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Until an arrow pierces through his liver. / As a bird hastens to the snare, / So he does not know that this <I>will cost him</I> his life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:24">&nbsp;7:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And now, <I>my</I> sons, listen to me, / And pay attention to the words of my mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:25">&nbsp;7:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; / Do not stray into her paths.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:26">&nbsp;7:26 &nbsp;</A></B> For many are those whom she has brought down wounded, / And numerous are all who have been slain by her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:27">&nbsp;7:27 &nbsp;</A></B> Her house is the way to Sheol, / Going down to the chambers of death.<BR>
