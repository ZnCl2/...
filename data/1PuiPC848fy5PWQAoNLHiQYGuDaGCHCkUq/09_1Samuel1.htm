</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now there was a certain man from Ramathaim-zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And he had two wives; the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other was Peninnah. Now Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And this man went up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests of Jehovah, were there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But he would give a double portion to Hannah, for it was Hannah whom he loved; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And her rival provoked her bitterly to irritate her, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And so it happened year after year; when she went up to the house of Jehovah, the other provoked her this way; and she wept and would not eat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why are you weeping, and why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then after the eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah rose up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat at the doorpost of the temple of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And she was bitter in soul and prayed to Jehovah and wept much.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And she made a vow and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your female servant and remember me and not forget Your female servant, but give to Your female servant a male child, then I will give him to Jehovah for all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And while she continued praying a long time before Jehovah, Eli watched her mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought that she was drunk.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine from you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord. I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not take your female servant for a worthless woman; for out of the greatness of my anxiety and provocation I have been speaking all this time.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your request that you have requested from Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:18">&nbsp;1:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And she said, Let your servant find favor in your sight. And the woman went her way; and she ate, and her countenance was <I>sad</I> no more.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:19">&nbsp;1:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah; and they returned and came to their house in Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Jehovah remembered her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:20">&nbsp;1:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel, For, <I>she said,</I> I asked for him of Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:21">&nbsp;1:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And the man Elkanah went up with all his house to offer the yearly sacrifice to Jehovah and his vow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:22">&nbsp;1:22 &nbsp;</A></B> But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, When the child is weaned, then I will bring him up, so that he may appear before Jehovah and stay there forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:23">&nbsp;1:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in your sight; stay until you have weaned him. Only, may Jehovah establish His word. So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she weaned him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:24">&nbsp;1:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And as soon as she weaned him, she brought him up with her, along with three bulls and one ephah of flour and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, although the child was young.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:25">&nbsp;1:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And they slaughtered the bull and brought the child to Eli.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:26">&nbsp;1:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And she said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here by you, praying to Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:27">&nbsp;1:27 &nbsp;</A></B> It was for this child that I prayed, and Jehovah has granted me my request that I requested from Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:28">&nbsp;1:28 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I, for my part, have lent him to Jehovah; all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.<BR>
