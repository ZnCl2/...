</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Where has your beloved gone, / O you most beautiful among women? / Where has your beloved turned, / That we may seek him with you?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> My beloved has gone down to his garden, / To the beds of spices, / To feed in the gardens / And gather lilies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine; / He pastures <I>his flock</I> among the lilies.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> You are as beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, / As lovely as Jerusalem, / As terrible as an army with banners.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Turn your eyes away from me, / For they overwhelm me, / Your hair is like a flock of goats / That repose on Mount Gilead.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes / That have come up from the washing, / All of which have borne twins, / And none of them is bereaved of her young.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Your cheeks are like a piece of pomegranate / Behind your veil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> There are sixty queens and eighty concubines / And virgins without number.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> My dove, my perfect one, is but one; / She is the only one of her mother; / She is the choice one of her who bore her. / The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; / The queens and the concubines, / They also praised her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Who is this woman who looks forth like the dawn, / As beautiful as the moon, / As clear as the sun, / As terrible as an army with banners?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> I went down to the orchard of nuts / To see the freshness of the valley, / To see whether the vine had budded, / Whether the pomegranates were in bloom.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Before I was aware, / My soul set me <I>among</I> the chariots of my noble people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Return, return, O Shulammite; / Return, return, that we may gaze at you. / Why should you gaze at the Shulammite, / As upon the dance of two camps?<BR>
