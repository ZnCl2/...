</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:1">16:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:2">16:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Because I exalted you out of the dust and made you a leader over My people Israel, yet you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin, thereby provoking Me to anger by their sins;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:3">16:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I am now sweeping up after Baasha and after his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:4">16:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Him of Baasha who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and him who dies in the field, the birds of heaven will eat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:5">16:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:7">16:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Moreover through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani the word of Jehovah came against Baasha and against his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands <I>and</I> by being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck it down.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:8">16:8 &nbsp;</A></B> In the twenty-sixth year of Asa the king of Judah Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:9">16:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And his servant Zimri, the captain of half <I>his</I> chariots, conspired against him. While he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:10">16:10&nbsp;</A></B> Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa the king of Judah; and he reigned in his place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:11">16:11&nbsp;</A></B> And as soon as he began to reign, just as he sat on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha; there was not a male left to him, neither kinsman nor friend.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:12">16:12&nbsp;</A></B> Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha according to the word of Jehovah, which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:13">16:13&nbsp;</A></B> Because of all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they committed and by which they caused Israel to sin, thereby provoking Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their idols.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:14">16:14&nbsp;</A></B> And the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:25">16:25&nbsp;</A></B> And Omri did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and was more evil than all who were before him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:26">16:26&nbsp;</A></B> And he went in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and in his sin by which he caused Israel to sin, thereby provoking Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their idols.<BR>
