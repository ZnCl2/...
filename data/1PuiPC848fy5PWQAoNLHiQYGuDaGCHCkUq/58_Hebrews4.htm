</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Let us fear therefore, lest, a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short <I>of it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For indeed we have had the good news announced to us, even as they also; but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed together with faith in those who heard.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For we who have believed enter into the rest, even as He has said, “As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!” although the works <I>of creation</I> were completed from the foundation of the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For He has spoken somewhere concerning the seventh day thus, “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And in this place again, “They shall not enter into My rest!”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Since therefore it remains that some should enter into it and those who formerly had the good news announced <I>to them</I> did not enter because of disobedience,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> He again designates a certain day, today, saying in David after so long a time, even as He has said before, “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For if Joshua had brought them into rest, He would not have spoken concerning another day after these things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His own.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are <I>to give</I> our account.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like <I>us, yet</I> without sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.<BR>
