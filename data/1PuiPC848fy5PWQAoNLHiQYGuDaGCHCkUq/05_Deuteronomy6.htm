</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the ordinances, which Jehovah your God has commanded <I>me</I> to teach you, that you may do <I>them</I> in the land into which you are crossing over to possess;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> That you may fear Jehovah your God and keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I am commanding you, you and your son and your grandson, all the days of your life; and that your days may be extended.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore hear, O Israel, and be certain to do <I>it,</I> that it may go well with you and that you may be greatly increased, <I>in</I> a land flowing with milk and honey, even as Jehovah, the God of your fathers, promised you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear, O Israel, Jehovah is our God; Jehovah is one.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And these words, which I command you today, shall be upon your heart;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall repeat them to your children, and speak about them when you sit in your house and when you journey on the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall bind them on your hand as a sign, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And when Jehovah your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you great and fine cities that you did not build,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And houses full of every good thing that you did not fill, and hewn cisterns that you did not hew, vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant, and you have eaten and are satisfied;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Be careful that you do not forget Jehovah who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the slave house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> It is Jehovah your God whom you shall fear, and Him whom you shall serve; and it is by His name <I>only</I> that you shall swear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> You shall not go after other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who surround you&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah your God is a jealous God in the midst of you. Otherwise the anger of Jehovah your God will be kindled against you, and He will destroy you from off the face of the earth.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:16">&nbsp;6:16 &nbsp;</A></B> You shall not test Jehovah your God, as you tested <I>Him</I> at Massah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:17">&nbsp;6:17 &nbsp;</A></B> You shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God and His testimonies and His statutes, which He has commanded you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:18">&nbsp;6:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Jehovah so that it may go well with you and you may enter and possess the good land, concerning which Jehovah swore to your fathers<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:19">&nbsp;6:19 &nbsp;</A></B> To drive out all your enemies from before you, as Jehovah has spoken.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:20">&nbsp;6:20 &nbsp;</A></B> When your son asks you in the future, saying, What is <I>the significance of</I> the testimonies and the statutes and the ordinances that Jehovah our God commanded you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:21">&nbsp;6:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Then you will say to your son, We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:22">&nbsp;6:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah put forth before our eyes great and grievous signs and wonders in Egypt against Pharaoh and all his house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:23">&nbsp;6:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, that He might give us the land which He swore to our fathers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:24">&nbsp;6:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes so that we would fear Jehovah our God for our good always <I>and</I> He would preserve us alive, as <I>we are</I> this day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:25">&nbsp;6:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And it will be righteousness to us if we are certain to do all this commandment before Jehovah our God, as He commanded us.<BR>
