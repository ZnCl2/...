</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:1">11:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:2">11:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed <I>them</I> down to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:3">11:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:4">11:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:5">11:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:6">11:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For if a woman is not covered, let <I>her hair</I> also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have <I>her hair</I> cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:7">11:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God’s image and glory; but the woman is the glory of the man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:8">11:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:9">11:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:10">11:10&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore the woman ought to have <I>a</I> <I>sign of submission to</I> authority on her head for the sake of the angels.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:11">11:11&nbsp;</A></B> However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:12">11:12&nbsp;</A></B> For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman; but all things are out from God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:13">11:13&nbsp;</A></B> Judge <I>this</I> in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:14">11:14&nbsp;</A></B> Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:15">11:15&nbsp;</A></B> But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:16">11:16&nbsp;</A></B> But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom <I>of being so,</I> neither the churches of God.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:17">11:17&nbsp;</A></B> But I give <I>you</I> this charge and do not praise <I>you,</I> because you come together not for the better but for the worse.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:18">11:18&nbsp;</A></B> For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part <I>of it</I> I believe.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:19">11:19&nbsp;</A></B> For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:20">11:20&nbsp;</A></B> When therefore you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:21">11:21&nbsp;</A></B> For in your eating, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry and the other is drunk.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:22">11:22&nbsp;</A></B> Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and put those to shame who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise <I>you.</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:23">11:23&nbsp;</A></B> For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:24">11:24&nbsp;</A></B> And having given thanks, He broke <I>it</I> and said, This is My body, which is <I>given</I> for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:25">11:25&nbsp;</A></B> Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant <I>established</I> in My blood; this do, as often as you drink <I>it,</I> unto the remembrance of Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:26">11:26&nbsp;</A></B> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord’s death until He comes.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:27">11:27&nbsp;</A></B> So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:28">11:28&nbsp;</A></B> But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:29">11:29&nbsp;</A></B> For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:30">11:30&nbsp;</A></B> Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:31">11:31&nbsp;</A></B> But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:32">11:32&nbsp;</A></B> But being judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:33">11:33&nbsp;</A></B> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:34">11:34&nbsp;</A></B> If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.<BR>
