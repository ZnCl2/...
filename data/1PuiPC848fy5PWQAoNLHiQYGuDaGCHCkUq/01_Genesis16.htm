</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:1">16:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, bore him no children; and she had an Egyptian female servant, whose name was Hagar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:2">16:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Sarai said to Abram, Because Jehovah has prevented me from bearing, please go in to my female servant; perhaps I will have children through her. And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:3">16:3 &nbsp;</A></B> So after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her female servant, and gave her to Abram her husband to be a wife.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:4">16:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:5">16:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And Sarai said to Abram, May the wrong <I>done</I> to me be upon you. I gave my female servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. May Jehovah judge between me and you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:6">16:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Abram said to Sarai, Your female servant is now in your hand; do to her what is good in your eyes. So Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from before her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:7">16:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:8">16:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said, Hagar, Sarai’s female servant, where did you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am fleeing from before my mistress Sarai.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:9">16:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:10">16:10&nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, I will greatly multiply your seed, so that it will not be counted for multitude.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:11">16:11&nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah said to her,<BR>
You have now conceived / And will bear a son, / And you shall call his name Ishmael, / Because Jehovah has heard of your affliction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:12">16:12&nbsp;</A></B> And he will be a wild ass of a man; / His hand will be against everyone, / And everyone’s hand, against him; / And he will settle down opposite all his brothers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:13">16:13&nbsp;</A></B> And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, You are a God who reveals Himself, for she said, Do I even remain here after He has revealed Himself to me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:14">16:14&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; there it is, between Kadesh and Bered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:15">16:15&nbsp;</A></B> And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:16">16:16&nbsp;</A></B> And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.<BR>
