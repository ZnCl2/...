</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now on the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said to Aaron, Take for yourself a calf of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and present <I>them</I> before Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Then to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal offering mingled with oil; for today Jehovah will appear to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> So they brought what Moses had commanded before the Tent of Meeting, and all the assembly came near and stood before Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded you to do, and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make expiation for yourself and for the people; and make the offering of the people and make expiation for them, just as Jehovah has commanded.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put <I>it</I> on the horns of the altar, and <I>the rest of</I> the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> But the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on and around the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned <I>them</I> on the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And he washed the inward parts and the legs and burned <I>them</I> upon the burnt offering on the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Then he presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Then he presented the meal offering and filled his hand with some of it and burned <I>it</I> on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:18">&nbsp;9:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him, which he sprinkled on and around the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:19">&nbsp;9:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And the fat portions of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and <I>the fat</I> which covers <I>the inward parts</I> and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:20">&nbsp;9:20 &nbsp;</A></B> These fat portions they then put on the breasts; and he burned the fat portions on the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:21">&nbsp;9:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:22">&nbsp;9:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:23">&nbsp;9:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. And they came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:24">&nbsp;9:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Then fire came forth from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw <I>it,</I> they gave a ringing shout and fell on their faces.<BR>
