</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:2">17:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse and spoke it in my hearing&nbsp;— look, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed of Jehovah be my son!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:3">17:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And he returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I do consecrate the silver to Jehovah from my hand to my son to make a sculptured idol and a molten image. Now therefore I will return it to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:4">17:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the founder, who made them into a sculptured idol and a molten image. And it was in the house of Micah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:5">17:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And the man Micah had a house of gods; and he made an ephod and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons to become his priest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:6">17:6 &nbsp;</A></B> In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:7">17:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was a sojourner there.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:9">17:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am traveling in order to dwell wherever I can find <I>a place.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:10">17:10&nbsp;</A></B> And Micah said to him, Stay with me, and be a father and a priest to me; and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and an array of clothing and your food. So the Levite went <I>with him.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:11">17:11&nbsp;</A></B> And the Levite was content to stay with the man; and the young man was to him like one of his sons.<BR>
