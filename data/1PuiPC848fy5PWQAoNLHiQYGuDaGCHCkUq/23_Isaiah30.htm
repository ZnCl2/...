</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:1">30:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to the rebellious children, / Declares Jehovah, / Who devise counsel, but not of Me, / And who make an alliance, but not of My Spirit, / In order to add / Sin upon sin;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:2">30:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Who go down to Egypt, / Yet do not ask of My mouth, / To take refuge in the refuge of Pharaoh, / And to take shelter in the shadow of Egypt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:3">30:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore the refuge of Pharaoh will be your shame, / And shelter in the shadow of Egypt, <I>your</I> humiliation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:4">30:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For their princes are at Zoan, / And their ambassadors have come to Hanes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:5">30:5 &nbsp;</A></B> All are ashamed / Of a people that cannot profit them, / Nor be a help or profit <I>to them,</I> / But rather a shame and also a reproach.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:6">30:6 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden concerning the beasts of the Negev: / Through the land of distress and anguish, / From which <I>come</I> lioness and lion, / Viper and flying fiery serpent, / They carry their riches upon young donkeys’ backs / And their treasures upon camels’ humps / To a people that cannot profit <I>them;</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:7">30:7 &nbsp;</A></B>  For Egypt helps in a vain and empty way. / Therefore I call her / Rahab, who sits still.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:8">30:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Go now; write it on a tablet before them, / And inscribe it on a scroll, / That it may be, for the time to come, / As a witness forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:9">30:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For this is a rebellious people, / False children, / Children who refuse to hear / The instruction of Jehovah;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:10">30:10&nbsp;</A></B> Who say to those who see, Do not see; / And to those who have visions, Do not give us true visions; / Speak pleasant things to us; / Give <I>us</I> illusions as your visions;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:11">30:11&nbsp;</A></B> Get out of the way; / Turn aside from the path; / Cause the Holy One of Israel / To cease from before us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:12">30:12&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, / Because you despise this word / And trust in oppression and guile, / And rely on them,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:13">30:13&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore this iniquity / Will be to you / Like a breach ready to fall, / Sticking out on a high wall, / Whose crashing comes / In an instant, suddenly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:14">30:14&nbsp;</A></B> And its crashing will be like the crashing of the potters’ vessel: / Crushed&nbsp;— he will not spare; / And there will not be found / Among the crushed pieces a shard / <I>With which</I> to take fire from the hearth / Or to draw water from the cistern.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:15">30:15&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, / In returning and rest you will be saved; / In quietness and in trust will be your strength; / But you were not willing,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:16">30:16&nbsp;</A></B> And said, No, for we will flee on horses; / Therefore you will flee. / And, We will ride upon the swift; / Therefore those who chase you will be swift.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:17">30:17&nbsp;</A></B> One thousand <I>will</I> <I>flee</I> at the rebuke of one; / At the rebuke of five you will flee, / Until you are left / Like a <I>bare</I> mast upon a mountaintop / And a standard on a hill.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:18">30:18&nbsp;</A></B> And therefore Jehovah waits to be gracious to you, / And therefore He remains on high to have compassion on you; / For Jehovah is a God of justice; / Blessed are those who wait for Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:19">30:19&nbsp;</A></B> For a people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem&nbsp;— / You will weep no more; / He will be most gracious to you at the sound of your cry; / When He hears it, He will answer you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:20">30:20&nbsp;</A></B> And though the Lord has given you / The bread of adversity and the water of oppression, / Your Teacher will no longer hide Himself in a corner, / But your eyes will see your Teacher.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:21">30:21&nbsp;</A></B> And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, / This is the way, walk in it, / When you turn to the right or turn to the left.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:22">30:22&nbsp;</A></B> And you will defile the silver covering of your graven images / And the gold plating of your molten idols; / You will scatter them like some dirty thing; / You will say to it, Go away!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:23">30:23&nbsp;</A></B> Then He will give rain for your seed, / Which you will sow in the ground, / And the bread of the increase of the ground; / And it will be fat and plenteous. / Your livestock will feed in that day / In a vast pasture.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:24">30:24&nbsp;</A></B> And the oxen and donkeys that work the ground / Will eat salted fodder that has been winnowed with shovel and fork.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:25">30:25&nbsp;</A></B> And upon every high mountain / And upon every prominent hill / There will be brooks <I>and</I> streams of water / In the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:26">30:26&nbsp;</A></B> And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days, / On the day when Jehovah binds up the breach of His people / And heals the wound <I>left</I> from His stroke.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:27">30:27&nbsp;</A></B> Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from a distance, / Burning with His anger and heavy with smoke; / His lips are full of indignation, / And His tongue is like a devouring fire;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:28">30:28&nbsp;</A></B> His breath, like an overflowing stream, / Reaches up to the neck, / To sift the nations with the sieve of nothingness; / And a bridle that leads them to err is in the jaws of the peoples.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:29">30:29&nbsp;</A></B> You will have a song / As in the night when the feast is sanctified, / And gladness of heart as when one marches to the flute / To go to the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:30">30:30&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will cause the majesty of His voice to be heard / And the descending of His arm to be seen, / With the blasting of anger and the flame of devouring fire, / In cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:31">30:31&nbsp;</A></B> For at the voice of Jehovah, Assyria will be dismayed; / With a staff He will strike.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:32">30:32&nbsp;</A></B> And every pass of the appointed rod, / Which Jehovah will lay upon him, / Will be with tambourines and harps; / And in battles of brandishing weapons He will fight against them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:33">30:33&nbsp;</A></B> For Topheth has been arranged since long ago; / Indeed it has been prepared for the king; / He made <I>it</I> deep; He made <I>it</I> large. / The pile in it is of fire and much wood; / The breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, / Sets it on fire.<BR>
