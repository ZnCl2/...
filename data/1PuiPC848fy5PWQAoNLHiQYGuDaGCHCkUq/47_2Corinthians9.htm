</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> For concerning the ministry to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For I know your eagerness, of which I boast on your behalf to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stirred up the greater number <I>of them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But I sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf might not be made void in this respect, that, as I said, you might be prepared;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Lest, if the Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, be put to shame in this confidence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I thought it necessary to entreat the brothers to go before to you and make ready beforehand your previously promised blessing, that thus this might be ready as a blessing and not as <I>a matter of</I> covetousness.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But <I>take note of</I> this: He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Even as it is written, “He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness abides forever.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of your righteousness to increase.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> You in everything are being enriched unto all liberality, which works out through us thanksgiving to God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Because the ministry of this service is not only filling up the lack of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> They, through the approving of this ministry, are glorifying God <I>based</I> upon the subjection unto the gospel of Christ that <I>issues</I> from your confession, and upon the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> While in petition on your behalf they also long after you on account of the surpassing grace of God upon you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!<BR>
