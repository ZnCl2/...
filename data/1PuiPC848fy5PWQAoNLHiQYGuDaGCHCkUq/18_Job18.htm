</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:1">18:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:2">18:2 &nbsp;</A></B> How long will you hunt for words? / Consider, and afterward we will speak.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:3">18:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Why are we considered <I>to be</I> like beasts / And have become unclean in your eyes?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:4">18:4 &nbsp;</A></B> You who tear yourself in your anger, / Will the earth be forsaken for your sake, / Or will the rock be removed from its place?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:5">18:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed the light of the wicked goes out, / And the flame of his fire does not shine.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:6">18:6 &nbsp;</A></B> The light is darkness in his tent, / And his lamp above him goes out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:7">18:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The steps of his strength are confined, / And his counsel has cast him down.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:8">18:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For he has been cast into a net by his own feet, / And he walks about on the webbing of a pitfall.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:9">18:9 &nbsp;</A></B> A snare grabs <I>him</I> by the heel; / A trap lays hold on him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:10">18:10&nbsp;</A></B> A rope is hidden for him on the ground, / And a trap for him, on the path.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:11">18:11&nbsp;</A></B> Terrors frighten him all around / And chase him at his heels.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:12">18:12&nbsp;</A></B> His strength is famished, / And calamity is prepared at his side.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:13">18:13&nbsp;</A></B> It devours the members of his body; / The firstborn of death devours his members.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:14">18:14&nbsp;</A></B> He is rooted out of his tent, in which he trusts; / And he is made to march to the king of terrors.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:15">18:15&nbsp;</A></B> That which is not his dwells in his tent; / Brimstone is scattered upon his habitation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:16">18:16&nbsp;</A></B> Beneath, his roots are dried up; / And above, his branch is withered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:17">18:17&nbsp;</A></B> The memory of him perishes from the earth, / And he has no name on the open plain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:18">18:18&nbsp;</A></B> He is thrust out from the light to the darkness / And driven from the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:19">18:19&nbsp;</A></B> He has no posterity and no progeny among his people, / And there are none remaining where he sojourned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:20">18:20&nbsp;</A></B> Those who come after will be astonished at his day, / As those who went before were horrified.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:21">18:21&nbsp;</A></B> Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust, / And this is the place of him who does not know God.<BR>
