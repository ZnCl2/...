</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:1">11:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And the whole earth had one language and the same speech.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:2">11:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And as they journeyed east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:3">11:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks and burn <I>them</I> thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had tar for mortar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:4">11:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top is in the heavens; and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the surface of the whole earth.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:5">11:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men had built.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:7">11:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Come, let Us go down and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:8">11:8 &nbsp;</A></B> So Jehovah scattered them from there over the surface of all the earth, and they ceased building the city.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:9">11:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Jehovah confounded the language of all the earth, and from there Jehovah scattered them over the surface of all the earth.<BR>
