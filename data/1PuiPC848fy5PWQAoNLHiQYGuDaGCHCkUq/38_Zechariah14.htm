</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:2">14:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half of the city will go forth into captivity, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:3">14:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights in a day of battle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:4">14:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley, so that half of the mountain will remove to the north and half of it to the south.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:5">14:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And you will flee into the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach unto Azel; yes, you will flee, just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah the king of Judah. And Jehovah my God will come, <I>and</I> all the saints with Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:6">14:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And in that day there will be no light; the shining ones will withdraw.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:7">14:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For it will be a <I>kind of </I> day known only to Jehovah, neither day nor night; but at evening time there will be light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:8">14:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And in that day living waters will go forth from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea; it will be there in summer and in winter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:9">14:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will be King over all the earth; and in that day Jehovah will be the one <I>God</I> and His name the one <I>name.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:10">14:10&nbsp;</A></B> All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and <I>Jerusalem</I> will be raised and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s Gate to the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and <I>from</I> the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:11">14:11&nbsp;</A></B> And <I>people</I> will dwell in her, and there will be no more curse, for Jerusalem will dwell securely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:12">14:12&nbsp;</A></B> And this will be the plague with which Jehovah will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are standing on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:13">14:13&nbsp;</A></B> And in that day a great panic from Jehovah will be among them; and each will seize his neighbor’s hand, and his hand will rise up against his neighbor’s hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:14">14:14&nbsp;</A></B> And Judah will also fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together, gold and silver and garments, in great abundance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:15">14:15&nbsp;</A></B> And as this plague is, so will the plague be on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey, and all the cattle that are in those camps.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:16">14:16&nbsp;</A></B> And everyone left from all the nations that went forth against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:17">14:17&nbsp;</A></B> And whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, upon them there will be no rain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:18">14:18&nbsp;</A></B> And if the family of Egypt does not go up and enter, there will be no <I>rain</I> upon them; there will be the plague with which Jehovah strikes the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:19">14:19&nbsp;</A></B> This will be the sin of Egypt and the sin of all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:20">14:20&nbsp;</A></B> In that day on the horses’ bells will be, Holiness to Jehovah; and the pots in the house of Jehovah will be like the basins before the altar.<BR>
