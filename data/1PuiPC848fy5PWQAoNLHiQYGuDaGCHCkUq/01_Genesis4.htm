</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain and said, I have acquired a man, Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And again she gave birth, to his brother Abel. And Abel was a tender of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And in the course of time Cain brought an offering to Jehovah from the fruit of the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Abel also brought <I>an</I> <I>offering,</I> from the firstlings of his flock, that is, from their fat portions. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and for his offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. And Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> If you do well, will not <I>your countenance</I> be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and his desire is for you, but you must rule over him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to Me from the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Now You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah put a mark on Cain, so that anyone who found him would not strike him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And Cain went forth from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And Lamech took two wives for himself: The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:20">&nbsp;4:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and <I>raise</I> cattle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:21">&nbsp;4:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:22">&nbsp;4:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:23">&nbsp;4:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And Lamech said to his wives,<BR>
Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; / O wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech; / For I have slain a man for wounding me, / Even a young man for striking me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:24">&nbsp;4:24 &nbsp;</A></B> If Cain is avenged sevenfold, / Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:25">&nbsp;4:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And Adam knew his wife again. And she gave birth to a son and called his name Seth, for, <I>she said,</I> God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain slew him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:26">&nbsp;4:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time <I>men</I> began to call upon the name of Jehovah.<BR>
