</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:1">15:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:2">15:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Son of man, what becomes of the wood of the vine in comparison to every <I>other kind of</I> wood, of the pruned branch <I>in comparison</I> to that which was on the trees of the forest?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:3">15:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Will wood from it be taken to make anything? Or will <I>men</I> take a peg from it to hang any vessel on?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:4">15:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed it is put into the fire as fuel; the fire consumes its two ends, and its middle is scorched. Is it good for anything?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:5">15:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed when it was whole, it was not made into anything. How much less, when fire has consumed it and it has been scorched, can it still be made into anything!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:6">15:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire as fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:7">15:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will set My face against them: They have gone forth from the fire, yet the fire will consume them; and you will know that I am Jehovah when I set My face against them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:8">15:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Lord Jehovah.<BR>
