</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:1">13:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:2">13:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And there was a certain man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had borne no <I>children.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:3">13:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman and said to her, Now you are barren and have borne no <I>children;</I> but you will conceive and bear a son.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:4">13:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And now be careful not to drink wine or strong drink nor to eat anything unclean;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:5">13:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the boy will be a Nazarite to God from the womb; and he will begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:6">13:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me; and His appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask Him where He was from, nor did He tell me His name;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:7">13:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But He said to me, You shall conceive and bear a son. And now do not drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean; for the boy will be a Nazarite to God from the womb until the day of his death.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:8">13:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Manoah entreated Jehovah and said, Oh, my Lord! Let the man of God, whom You sent, come again to us, I pray; and let Him teach us what we should do with the boy that is to be born.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:9">13:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God came again to the woman while she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:10">13:10&nbsp;</A></B> And the woman hurried and ran off; and she told her husband and said to him, The man who came to me that day has just appeared to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:11">13:11&nbsp;</A></B> And Manoah rose up and followed his wife and came to the man. And he said to Him, Are You the man who spoke to this woman? And He said, I am.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:12">13:12&nbsp;</A></B> And Manoah said, Now when Your words come to pass, what rule shall the boy follow, and what shall he do?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:13">13:13&nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Observe all that I spoke to this woman.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:14">13:14&nbsp;</A></B> She is not to eat of anything that comes forth from the grapevine, nor is she to drink wine or strong drink, nor is she to eat anything unclean; she shall observe all that I commanded her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:15">13:15&nbsp;</A></B> And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, Let us detain You, we pray, that we may prepare a kid for You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:16">13:16&nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, If you detain Me, I will not eat your food; but if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it up to Jehovah. For Manoah did not know that He was the Angel of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:17">13:17&nbsp;</A></B> Then Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, What is Your name, so that when Your words come to pass, we may honor You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:18">13:18&nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:19">13:19&nbsp;</A></B> And Manoah took the kid with the meal offering and offered <I>it</I> up upon the rock to Jehovah; and He acted wondrously, while Manoah and his wife looked on.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:20">13:20&nbsp;</A></B> And when the flame went up from the altar to heaven, the Angel of Jehovah went up in the flame of the altar, while Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:21">13:21&nbsp;</A></B> And the Angel of Jehovah did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:22">13:22&nbsp;</A></B> And Manoah said to his wife, We will surely die, for we have seen God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:23">13:23&nbsp;</A></B> But his wife said to him, If Jehovah had been pleased to kill us, He would not have taken a burnt offering and a meal offering from our hand, nor would He have shown us all these things or let us hear <I>a thing</I> like this at this time.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:24">13:24&nbsp;</A></B> And the woman bore a son, and she called his name Samson. And the boy grew up, and Jehovah blessed him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:25">13:25&nbsp;</A></B> And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him at Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.<BR>
