</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear now what Jehovah says: / Arise, contend before the mountains, / And let the hills hear your voice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear, O mountains, Jehovah’s contention, / And you enduring foundations of the earth; / For Jehovah has a contention with His people, / And with Israel He will dispute.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> O My people, what have I done to You? / And with what have I wearied you? Testify against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, / And from the slave house I redeemed you; / And I sent before you Moses, / Aaron, and Miriam.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> O My people, remember now what Balak the king of Moab counseled, / And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, / From Shittim to Gilgal, / That you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> With what shall I come before Jehovah / And bow myself before the high God? / Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, / With one-year-old calves?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, / With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? / Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, / The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He has declared to you, O man, what is good; / And what does Jehovah require of you, / But that you would execute justice and love mercy / And walk humbly with your God?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The voice of Jehovah cries out to the city, / And wisdom looks upon Your name. / Hear the rod and Him who appointed it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, / And a scant measure that is abominable?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Shall I be pure with wicked balances / And with a bag of deceitful weights?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For the rich men of the city are full of violence, / And those who inhabit it speak falsehood, / And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus I also have made<I> you</I> sick by striking you; / I have made <I>you</I> desolate because of your sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> You will eat, but you will not be satisfied; / And your emptiness <I>will remain</I> in the midst of you; / And you will take away, / But you will not rescue, / And what you rescue I will give up to the sword.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> You will sow, / But you will not reap; / You will tread olives, / But you will not anoint <I>yourself</I> with oil, / And the new wine, / But you will not drink wine.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:16">&nbsp;6:16 &nbsp;</A></B> For the statutes of Omri are kept, / And all the works of the house of Ahab; / And you walk in their counsels, / That I may make you a desolation, / And the inhabitants of the city a hissing; / And you will bear the reproach of My people.<BR>
