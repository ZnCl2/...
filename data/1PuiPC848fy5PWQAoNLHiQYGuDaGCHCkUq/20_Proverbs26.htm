</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:1">26:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest, / So honor is not fitting for a fool.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:2">26:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Like the sparrow in <I>its</I> fluttering, like the swallow in <I>its</I> flying, / So a curse without cause does not alight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:3">26:3 &nbsp;</A></B> A whip for the horse! A bridle for the donkey! / And a rod for the back of fools!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:4">26:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not answer a fool according to his folly, / Lest you also be like him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:5">26:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Answer a fool according to his folly, / Lest he be wise in his own eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:6">26:6 &nbsp;</A></B> He who sends a message by the hand of a fool / Cuts off <I>his own</I> feet <I>and</I> drinks violence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:7">26:7 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Like</I> the legs of the lame which hang down, / So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:8">26:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Like one who binds a stone in a sling, / So is he who gives honor to a fool.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:9">26:9 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Like</I> a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard, / So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:10">26:10&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Like</I> an archer who wounds everyone, / So is he who hires a fool or who hires those who pass by.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:11">26:11&nbsp;</A></B> Like a dog that returns to its vomit / Is a fool who repeats his folly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:12">26:12&nbsp;</A></B> Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? / There is more hope for a fool than for him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:13">26:13&nbsp;</A></B> The sluggard says, There is a roaring lion on the way; / A lion is in the streets!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:14">26:14&nbsp;</A></B> <I>As</I> the door turns upon its hinges, / So does the sluggard upon his bed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:15">26:15&nbsp;</A></B> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; / He gets weary by bringing it to his mouth again.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:16">26:16&nbsp;</A></B> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes / Than seven men who can answer discreetly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:17">26:17&nbsp;</A></B> He who passes by <I>and</I> meddles with strife that does not belong to him, / Is <I>like</I> one who takes a dog by the ears.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:18">26:18&nbsp;</A></B> Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:19">26:19&nbsp;</A></B>  So is the man who deceives his neighbor, / And says, Was I not joking?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:20">26:20&nbsp;</A></B> For lack of wood the fire goes out, / And where there is no whisperer, contention quiets down.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:21">26:21&nbsp;</A></B> <I>As</I> charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, / So is a contentious man to kindle strife.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:22">26:22&nbsp;</A></B> The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, / And they go down into the innermost parts of one’s being.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:23">26:23&nbsp;</A></B> Burning lips and a wicked heart / Are <I>like</I> an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:24">26:24&nbsp;</A></B> He who hates disguises <I>it</I> with his lips, / But he lays up deceit within him;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:25">26:25&nbsp;</A></B> When he speaks graciously, do not believe him; / For there are seven abominations in his heart;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:26">26:26&nbsp;</A></B> Though <I>his</I> hatred covers itself with guile, / His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:27">26:27&nbsp;</A></B> Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, / And he who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:28">26:28&nbsp;</A></B> A lying tongue hates those it crushes, / And a flattering mouth works ruin.<BR>
