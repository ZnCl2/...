</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man utters rashly with an oath, and it escapes his <I>notice,</I> when he comes to know <I>it,</I> then he shall be guilty in one of these things.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring <I>as</I> his trespass offering to Jehovah for that in which he has sinned two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall present first that which is for the sin offering; and the priest shall wring off its head at the front of its neck but shall not sever <I>it;</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And he shall offer the second as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. And the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn <I>it</I> on the altar, upon Jehovah’s offerings by fire; it is a sin offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning his sin that he has committed in any one of these things, and he will be forgiven. And <I>the</I> <I>rest</I> shall be the priest’s, like the meal offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone acts unfaithfully and sins without intent in the holy things of Jehovah, then he shall bring his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock according to your valuation in silver by shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And he shall make restitution for the holy thing in which he has sinned, and he shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest.
