</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:1">12:1 &nbsp;</A></B> To boast is necessary, <I>though</I> indeed not expedient; yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:2">12:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows) such a one was caught away to the third heaven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:3">12:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And I know such a man (whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know; God knows),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:4">12:4 &nbsp;</A></B> That he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to speak.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:5">12:5 &nbsp;</A></B> On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:6">12:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For if I desire to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth; but I refrain lest anyone account of me <I>something</I> above what he sees me <I>to be</I> or hears from me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:7">12:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And because of the transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:8">12:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:9">12:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:10">12:10&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, on behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:11">12:11&nbsp;</A></B> I have become foolish; you yourselves have compelled me. For <I>it is</I> I <I>who</I> should have been commended by you; for in nothing am I inferior to the super-apostles, even though I am nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:12">12:12&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all endurance by signs and wonders and works of power.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:13">12:13&nbsp;</A></B> For what is there in which you were treated in a manner inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Graciously forgive me this injustice!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:14">12:14&nbsp;</A></B> Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden; for I do not seek what is yours but you. For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:15">12:15&nbsp;</A></B> But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved less?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:16">12:16&nbsp;</A></B> But let it be <I>so!</I> I did not burden you; but, <I>as some of you say,</I> being crafty, I took you by guile.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:17">12:17&nbsp;</A></B> Did I take advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:18">12:18&nbsp;</A></B> I entreated Titus and sent with <I>him</I> the brother. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same steps?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:19">12:19&nbsp;</A></B> All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Before God in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, <I>are</I> for your building up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:20">12:20&nbsp;</A></B> For I fear that perhaps when I come, I may find you not such as I wish, and I may be found by you not such as you wish; that perhaps <I>there may be</I> strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, slanders, whisperings, demonstrations of being puffed up, tumults;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="12:21">12:21&nbsp;</A></B> That when I come again my God may humble me before you and I may mourn over many who have sinned before and who have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practiced.<BR>
