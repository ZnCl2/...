</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greediness, which is idolatry;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of which things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> In which you also once walked, when you lived in these things.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But now, you also, put away all <I>these</I> things: wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, foul abusive language out of your mouth.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, inward parts of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against anyone; even as the Lord forgave you, so also <I>should</I> you forgive.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And over all these things <I>put on</I> love, which is the uniting bond of perfectness.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms <I>and</I> hymns <I>and</I> spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And whatever you do in word or in deed, <I>do</I> all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:20">&nbsp;3:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:21">&nbsp;3:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Fathers, do not vex your children, that they may not be disheartened.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:22">&nbsp;3:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Slaves, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart fearing the Lord.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:23">&nbsp;3:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not to men,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:24">&nbsp;3:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as recompense. You serve the Lord Christ.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:25">&nbsp;3:25 &nbsp;</A></B> For he who does unrighteously will receive what he unrighteously did, and there is no respect of persons.<BR>
