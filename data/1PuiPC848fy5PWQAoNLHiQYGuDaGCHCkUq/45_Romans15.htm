</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:1">15:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak and not to please ourselves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:2">15:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Let each of us please his neighbor with a view to what is good for building up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:3">15:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For Christ also did not please Himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:4">15:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For the things that were written previously were written for our instruction, in order that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:5">15:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:6">15:6 &nbsp;</A></B> That with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:7">15:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you to the glory of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:8">15:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the sake of God’s truthfulness, to confirm the promises <I>given</I> to the fathers,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:9">15:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And that the Gentiles should glorify God for <I>His</I> mercy, as it is written, “Therefore I will extol You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:10">15:10&nbsp;</A></B> And again he says, “Rejoice, Gentiles, with His people.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:11">15:11&nbsp;</A></B> And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples speak praise to Him.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:12">15:12&nbsp;</A></B> And again, Isaiah says, “There shall be the root of Jesse, even He who rises to rule the Gentiles; on Him will the Gentiles hope.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:13">15:13&nbsp;</A></B> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:14">15:14&nbsp;</A></B> But I myself also am persuaded concerning you, my brothers, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:15">15:15&nbsp;</A></B> But I have written the more boldly to you on some points so as to remind you <I>of them</I> again because of the grace given to me by God<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:16">15:16&nbsp;</A></B> That I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:17">15:17&nbsp;</A></B> I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:18">15:18&nbsp;</A></B> For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not accomplished through me for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and by work,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:19">15:19&nbsp;</A></B> In the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:20">15:20&nbsp;</A></B> But <I>have done</I> so aspiring to announce the gospel not where Christ has been named, so that I would not build upon another’s foundation;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:21">15:21&nbsp;</A></B> But as it is written, “They will see, they to whom nothing concerning Him was announced; and those who have not heard will understand.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:22">15:22&nbsp;</A></B> For this reason also I have been hindered these many times from coming to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:23">15:23&nbsp;</A></B> But now I no longer have place in these regions and have had a desire since many years ago to come to you<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:24">15:24&nbsp;</A></B> Whenever I may go to Spain, for I hope to see you in passing and be sent forward there by you, if first I am filled, <I>at least</I> in part, by your <I>company.</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:25">15:25&nbsp;</A></B> But now I am going to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:26">15:26&nbsp;</A></B> For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:27">15:27&nbsp;</A></B> For they were pleased <I>to do it,</I> and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they ought also to do service to them in material things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:28">15:28&nbsp;</A></B> When therefore I have finished this and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:29">15:29&nbsp;</A></B> And I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:30">15:30&nbsp;</A></B> Now I exhort you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:31">15:31&nbsp;</A></B> That I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and <I>that</I> my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:32">15:32&nbsp;</A></B> So that coming to you in joy through the will of God, I may refresh myself and rest with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:33">15:33&nbsp;</A></B> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.<BR>
