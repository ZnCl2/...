</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:1">39:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:2">39:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he became a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:3">39:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:4">39:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered to him; and he made him overseer of his house and put all that he had in his charge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:5">39:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And from the time he made him overseer in his house and <I>put him</I> over all that he had, Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s house on account of Joseph; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:6">39:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And he left all that he had in Joseph’s charge; and with him <I>there,</I> he was not concerned about anything except the food that he ate. And Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:7">39:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Now after these things his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, Lie with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:8">39:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But he refused and said to his master’s wife, Behold, with me <I>here,</I> my master is not concerned about anything in the house, and he has put everything he has in my charge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:9">39:9 &nbsp;</A></B> There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:10">39:10&nbsp;</A></B> And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her to lie beside her <I>or</I> be with her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:11">39:11&nbsp;</A></B> And one such day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were there in the house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:12">39:12&nbsp;</A></B> And she grabbed him by his garment, saying, Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and went outside.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:13">39:13&nbsp;</A></B> And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:14">39:14&nbsp;</A></B> She called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew man to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I called out with a loud voice;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:15">39:15&nbsp;</A></B> And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me, and fled and went outside.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:16">39:16&nbsp;</A></B> And she placed his garment beside her until his master came home.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:17">39:17&nbsp;</A></B> And she spoke to him with these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:18">39:18&nbsp;</A></B> And when I lifted up my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:19">39:19&nbsp;</A></B> And when his master heard the words of his wife that she had spoken to him, saying, This is the way your servant treated me; his anger burned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:20">39:20&nbsp;</A></B> And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while he was there in the prison,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:21">39:21&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah was with Joseph; and He extended kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:22">39:22&nbsp;</A></B> And the chief jailer put in Joseph’s charge all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the one to do <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:23">39:23&nbsp;</A></B> The chief jailer did not supervise anything that was in his charge, because Jehovah was with him; and whatever he did, Jehovah caused <I>it</I> to prosper.<BR>
