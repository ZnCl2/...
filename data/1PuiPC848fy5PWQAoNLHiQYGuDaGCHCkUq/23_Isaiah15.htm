</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:1">15:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden concerning Moab:<BR>
Indeed in a night it is devastated&nbsp;— / Ar of Moab is cut off. / Indeed in a night it is devastated&nbsp;— / Kir of Moab is cut off.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:2">15:2 &nbsp;</A></B> They have gone up to their temple and to Dibon, / <I>That is,</I> to their high places, to weep. / Over Nebo and over Medeba / Moab howls; / Upon all their heads is baldness; / Every beard is shaved off.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:3">15:3 &nbsp;</A></B> In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; / On their roofs / And in their open squares everyone will howl, / Melting in tears.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:4">15:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; / Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz. / Because of this the armed men of Moab raise a cry; / Their soul quivers within them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:5">15:5 &nbsp;</A></B> My heart cries out for Moab; / Its fugitives <I>reach</I> as far as Zoar, <I>as far as</I> Eglath-shelishiyah: / By the ascent of Luhith / With weeping they will go up; / On the way <I>that leads to</I> Horonaim / They will raise up a cry of destruction;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:6">15:6 &nbsp;</A></B> The waters of Nimrim / Will be a devastation; / The foliage will be dried up, the grass wasted away; / There will be nothing green.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:7">15:7 &nbsp;</A></B> As a result, the abundance they have produced / And placed in reserve / Will be carried off / To the poplar brook.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:8">15:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For the cry has gone about / The border of Moab; / Their howling <I>goes</I> as far as Eglaim, / Even to Beer-elim their howling <I>reaches.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:9">15:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, / For I will bring upon Dimon additional things: / Lions upon those in Moab who escape / And upon the remnant of the land.<BR>
