</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I have come into my garden, my sister, <I>my</I> bride; / I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;<BR>
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; / I have drunk my wine with my milk. / Eat, O friends; / Drink, and drink deeply, O beloved ones!<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking. / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is drenched with dew, / My locks with the drops of night.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I have put off my garment; / How can I put it on <I>again?</I> / I have washed my feet; / How can I dirty them <I>again?</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> My beloved put his hand into the opening <I>of the door,</I> / And my inner parts yearned for him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> I rose up to open to my beloved; / And my hands dripped with myrrh, / My fingers with liquid myrrh, / Upon the handles of the bolt.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I opened to my beloved, / But my beloved had withdrawn; he was gone. / My soul failed when he spoke; / I sought him, but found him not; / I called him&nbsp;— he answered me not.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The watchmen who go about the city found me. / They struck me; they wounded me; / The keepers of the walls took my veil from me.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> I adjure, O daughters of Jerusalem, / If you find my beloved, / What shall you tell him? / That I am sick with love.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> What is your beloved more than <I>some other’s</I> beloved, / O you most beautiful among women? / What is your beloved more than <I>some other’s</I> beloved, / That you adjure us so?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> My beloved is dazzling white yet ruddy, / Distinguished among ten thousand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> His head is the finest gold; / His locks are wavy, / As black as a raven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> His eyes are like doves / Beside the streams of water, / Bathed in milk, / Fitly set.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> His cheeks are like a bed of spices, / Mounds of sweetly fragrant herbs; / His lips are lilies, / Dripping with liquid myrrh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> His hands are tubes of gold, / Set with beryl; / His belly is an ivory work, / Overlaid with sapphires.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> His legs are pillars of white marble, / Set upon bases of gold; / His appearance is like Lebanon, / As excellent as the cedars.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> His mouth is sweetness itself, / And he is altogether desirable. / This is my beloved, and this is my friend, / O daughters of Jerusalem.<BR>
