</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:1">24:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:2">24:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:3">24:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:4">24:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And while they <I>stood</I> perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:5">24:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And they became frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, and <I>the men</I> said to them, Why are you seeking the living One among the dead?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:6">24:6 &nbsp;</A></B> He is not here but has been raised. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:7">24:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:8">24:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And they remembered His words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:9">24:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:10">24:10&nbsp;</A></B> Now they were Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the <I>mother</I> of James and the rest of the women with them, who told these things to the apostles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:11">24:11&nbsp;</A></B> And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they did not believe them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:12">24:12&nbsp;</A></B> But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb; and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths alone, and he went away to his own <I>home,</I> marveling at what had happened.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:13">24:13&nbsp;</A></B> And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia away from Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:14">24:14&nbsp;</A></B> And they were talking to each other concerning all these things which had occurred.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:15">24:15&nbsp;</A></B> And while they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:16">24:16&nbsp;</A></B> But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:17">24:17&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking? And they stood still, looking sad.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:18">24:18&nbsp;</A></B> And one <I>of them,</I> Cleopas by name, answered and said to Him, Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:19">24:19&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:20">24:20&nbsp;</A></B> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death and crucified Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:21">24:21&nbsp;</A></B> But we were hoping that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all these things, it is <I>now</I> going on the third day since these things took place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:22">24:22&nbsp;</A></B> But moreover some women from among us amazed us. Being at the tomb early<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:23">24:23&nbsp;</A></B> And not finding His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He is living.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:24">24:24&nbsp;</A></B> And some of those with us went to the tomb and found <I>it</I> even as the women also said, but they did not see Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:25">24:25&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:26">24:26&nbsp;</A></B> Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:27">24:27&nbsp;</A></B> And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:28">24:28&nbsp;</A></B> And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:29">24:29&nbsp;</A></B> And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by. And He went in to stay with them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:30">24:30&nbsp;</A></B> And as He reclined <I>at table</I> with them, He took the loaf and blessed <I>it,</I> and having broken <I>it,</I> He began handing <I>it</I> to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:31">24:31&nbsp;</A></B> And their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He disappeared from them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:32">24:32&nbsp;</A></B> And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:33">24:33&nbsp;</A></B> And they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those with them assembled together,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:34">24:34&nbsp;</A></B> Saying, The Lord really has been raised and has appeared to Simon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:35">24:35&nbsp;</A></B> And they related the things <I>that occurred</I> on the road, and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:36">24:36&nbsp;</A></B> And as they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:37">24:37&nbsp;</A></B> But they were terrified and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:38">24:38&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your heart?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:39">24:39&nbsp;</A></B> See My hands and My feet, that <I>it</I> is I Myself. Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:40">24:40&nbsp;</A></B> And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:41">24:41&nbsp;</A></B> And while they still did not believe for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything here to eat?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:42">24:42&nbsp;</A></B> And they handed Him a piece of broiled fish;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:43">24:43&nbsp;</A></B> And He took <I>it</I> and ate before them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:44">24:44&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:45">24:45&nbsp;</A></B> Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:46">24:46&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:47">24:47&nbsp;</A></B> And that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:48">24:48&nbsp;</A></B> You are witnesses of these things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:49">24:49&nbsp;</A></B> And behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:50">24:50&nbsp;</A></B> And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:51">24:51&nbsp;</A></B> And while He blessed them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:52">24:52&nbsp;</A></B> And they worshipped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:53">24:53&nbsp;</A></B> And were continually in the temple, blessing God. <BR>
