</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And it was a long time from the day that the Ark began to abide in Kiriath-jearim, for it was twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you are returning with all your heart to Jehovah, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from your midst, and direct your heart to Jehovah and serve only Him; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served only Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Jehovah for you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured <I>it</I> out before Jehovah, and they fasted that day. And they said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel gathered themselves at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard <I>of it,</I> they were afraid of the Philistines.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Do not stop crying to Jehovah our God for us, so that He will save us from the hand of the Philistines.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah. And Samuel cried out to Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answered him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And while Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines approached for battle against Israel. And Jehovah thundered with a great voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into a panic; and they were struck down before Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And the men of Israel went out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and they struck them as far as below Beth-car.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Samuel took a stone and set <I>it</I> between Mizpah and Shen; and he called its name Ebenezer and said, Thus far Jehovah has helped us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> So the Philistines were subdued, and they no longer came into the territory of Israel. And the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel rescued their territory from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And he went year by year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all those places.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Then he would return to Ramah, for his house was there. And he judged Israel there and built an altar to Jehovah there.<BR>
