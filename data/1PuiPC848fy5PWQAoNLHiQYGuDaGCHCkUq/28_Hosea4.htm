</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear the word of Jehovah, / O children of Israel; / For Jehovah has a controversy / With the inhabitants of the land. / For there is no faithfulness or kindness / And no knowledge of God in the land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Rather</I> there are swearing and deceiving and murder / And stealing and adultery; / They are violent, / And bloodshed follows bloodshed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of this the land mourns, / And all the inhabitants languish within it, / With the beasts of the field / And with the birds of heaven; / Indeed, even the fish of the sea will be taken away.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet let no man contend, / And let no man reprove; / For your people are like those who contend with the priest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And you will stumble in the day, / And the prophet also will stumble / With you in the night; / And I will destroy your mother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> My people are destroyed / Because of a lack of that knowledge. / For you have rejected that knowledge, / And I will reject you, so that you will not be a priest to Me; / Since you have forgotten the law of your God, / I also will forget your children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The more they were multiplied, the more they sinned against Me; / I will change their glory into shame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> They feed on the sin of My people, / And their soul desires their iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And it will be that as it is with the people, so it will be with the priest; / Thus I will visit their ways upon them, / And I will recompense their doings to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And they will eat but will not be filled; / And they will commit fornication but will not increase; / For they have ceased giving heed to Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Fornication and wine / And new wine take away <I>their</I> heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> My people inquire at their wooden post, / And their rod informs them of <I>things;</I> / For a spirit of harlotries makes <I>them</I> err, / And they have gone about as harlots away from their God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Upon the tops of the mountains they offer sacrifices, / And upon the hills they burn incense, / Under oak, poplar, and terebinth, / Because its shade is good. / Therefore your daughters go about as harlots, / And your brides commit adultery.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> I will not punish your daughters when they go about as harlots / Nor your brides when they commit adultery; / For <I>the men</I> themselves go off with harlots, / And they offer sacrifices with the prostitutes; / And the people who have no understanding will be cast down.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Though you, Israel, go about as a harlot, / Let not Judah trespass; / And do not come to Gilgal, / Nor go up to Beth-aven, / Nor swear, As Jehovah lives.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> For Israel is stubborn, / Like a stubborn heifer; / Will Jehovah now pasture them / Like a lamb in a spacious place?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim is joined to idols; / Leave him alone.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Their liquor has ended; / They have given themselves up to harlotry; / Their rulers dearly love shame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> The wind has wrapped her up in its wings, / And they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices.<BR>
