</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:1">10:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:2">10:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:3">10:3 &nbsp;</A></B> To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:4">10:4 &nbsp;</A></B> When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:5">10:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:6">10:6 &nbsp;</A></B> This parable Jesus spoke to them, but they did not know what those things meant that He spoke to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:7">10:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:8">10:8 &nbsp;</A></B> All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:9">10:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:10">10:10&nbsp;</A></B> The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and may have <I>it</I> abundantly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:11">10:11&nbsp;</A></B> I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:12">10:12&nbsp;</A></B> He who is a hireling and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:13">10:13&nbsp;</A></B> <I>He flees</I> because he is a hireling and it does not matter to him concerning the sheep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:14">10:14&nbsp;</A></B> I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:15">10:15&nbsp;</A></B> Even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:16">10:16&nbsp;</A></B> And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:17">10:17&nbsp;</A></B> For this <I>reason</I> the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:18">10:18&nbsp;</A></B> No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:19">10:19&nbsp;</A></B> A division again took place among the Jews because of these words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:20">10:20&nbsp;</A></B> And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:21">10:21&nbsp;</A></B> Others said, These are not the words of one <I>who is</I> demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:22">10:22&nbsp;</A></B> At that time the Feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, <I>and</I> it was winter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:23">10:23&nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:24">10:24&nbsp;</A></B> The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will You hold our soul in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:25">10:25&nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in My Father’s name, these testify concerning Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:26">10:26&nbsp;</A></B> But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:27">10:27&nbsp;</A></B> My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:28">10:28&nbsp;</A></B> And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:29">10:29&nbsp;</A></B> My Father, who has given <I>them</I> to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch <I>them</I> out of My Father’s hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:30">10:30&nbsp;</A></B> I and the Father are one.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:31">10:31&nbsp;</A></B> The Jews again took up stones that they might stone Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:32">10:32&nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:33">10:33&nbsp;</A></B> The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:34">10:34&nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, “I said, You are gods”?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:35">10:35&nbsp;</A></B> If He said they were gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:36">10:36&nbsp;</A></B> Do you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:37">10:37&nbsp;</A></B> If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:38">10:38&nbsp;</A></B> But if I do <I>them,</I> even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:39">10:39&nbsp;</A></B> Then they sought again to seize Him, yet He went forth out of their hand.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:40">10:40&nbsp;</A></B> And He went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at first, and He remained there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:41">10:41&nbsp;</A></B> And many came to Him and said, John did no sign, but all the things John said concerning this man were true.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:42">10:42&nbsp;</A></B> And many believed into Him there.<BR>
