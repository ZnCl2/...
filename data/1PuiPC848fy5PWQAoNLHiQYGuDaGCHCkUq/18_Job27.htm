</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:1">27:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job again took up his discourse and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:2">27:2 &nbsp;</A></B> As God lives, who has taken away my right, / And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:3">27:3 &nbsp;</A></B> As long as my breath is in me / And the spirit of God is in my nostrils,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:4">27:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Surely my lips will not speak anything wrong, / Nor will my tongue utter deceit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:5">27:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Far be it from me to declare you righteous! / Until I die, I will not put away my integrity from me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:6">27:6 &nbsp;</A></B> To my righteousness I will hold fast, I will not let it go; / My heart does not reproach <I>me</I> for any of my days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:7">27:7 &nbsp;</A></B> May my enemy be like a wicked man, / And may he who rises up against me be like someone unjust.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:8">27:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For what is the hope of the profane man when God cuts <I>him</I> off, / When He takes away his soul?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:9">27:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Will God hear his cry / When distress comes upon him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:10">27:10&nbsp;</A></B> Does he take delight in the Almighty? / Will he call upon God at all times?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:11">27:11&nbsp;</A></B> I will teach you about the hand of God; / What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:12">27:12&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, all of you have seen <I>it</I> yourselves; / And why then have you become altogether vain?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:13">27:13&nbsp;</A></B> This is the portion with God for a wicked man, / And the inheritance that oppressors receive from the Almighty:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:14">27:14&nbsp;</A></B> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; / And his offspring will not be satisfied with bread;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:15">27:15&nbsp;</A></B> Those who remain of him will be buried in death, / And his widows will not lament.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:16">27:16&nbsp;</A></B> Though he heaps up silver like dust / And prepares garments like clay,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:17">27:17&nbsp;</A></B> He may prepare <I>them,</I> but the righteous will wear <I>them;</I> / And the innocent will divide the silver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:18">27:18&nbsp;</A></B> He builds his house as a moth does / And like a hut that a watchman makes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:19">27:19&nbsp;</A></B> He lies down rich but <I>will be rich</I> no more; / He opens his eyes, and he is not.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:20">27:20&nbsp;</A></B> Terrors overtake him like waters; / At night a whirlwind steals him away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:21">27:21&nbsp;</A></B> The east wind carries him off, and he goes; / And it sweeps him out of his place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:22">27:22&nbsp;</A></B> And <I>God</I> hurls at him and does not spare; / He hastily flees from His hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:23">27:23&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Men</I> clap their hands at him / And hiss him out of his place.<BR>
