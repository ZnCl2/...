</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="62:1">62:1 &nbsp;</A></B> For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, / And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not be quiet, / Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, / And her salvation like a burning torch.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="62:2">62:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And the nations will see your righteousness, / And all the kings, your glory; / And you will be called by a new name, / Which the mouth of Jehovah will designate.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="62:4">62:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And it will no longer be said to you, Forsaken! / Nor to your land will it be said any longer, Desolate! / But you will be called, My delight is in her, / And your land, Married; / For Jehovah delights in you, / And your land will be married.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="62:5">62:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For <I>as</I> a young man marries a virgin, / Your sons will marry you; / And with the joy of the bridegroom over the bride / Your God will rejoice over you.<BR>
