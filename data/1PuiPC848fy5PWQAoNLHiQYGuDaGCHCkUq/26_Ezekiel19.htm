</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:1">19:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:2">19:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And say,<BR>What was your mother? / A lioness among lions. / She lay in the midst of young lions; / She brought up her whelps.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:3">19:3 &nbsp;</A></B> When she raised up one of her whelps, / He became a young lion; / And he learned to take prey; / He devoured men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:4">19:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the nations heard of him; / He was captured in their pit, / And they brought him with hooks / To the land of Egypt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:5">19:5 &nbsp;</A></B> When she saw that she had waited, / That her hope was lost, / She took another one of her whelps; / She made him a young lion.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:6">19:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And he went about among the lions; / He became a young lion. / And he learned to take prey; / He devoured men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:7">19:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And he destroyed their citadels / And laid waste their cities; / And the land and its fullness were horrified / At the sound of his roaring.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:8">19:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the nations set against him / All around from the provinces / And spread their net over him; / He was captured in their pit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:9">19:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And they put him in a cage with hooks / And brought him to the king of Babylon&nbsp;— / They brought him into strongholds&nbsp;— / That his voice would no longer be heard / Upon the mountains of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:10">19:10&nbsp;</A></B> Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, / Transplanted beside the waters; / It was fruitful and full of branches / Because of abundant waters.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:11">19:11&nbsp;</A></B> And it had strong branches / For scepters of those who rule; / And its height was exalted among the leafy boughs, / And it was visible in its height because of the multitude of its branches.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:12">19:12&nbsp;</A></B> But it was plucked up in wrath; / It was cast down to the ground; / And the east wind dried up its fruit; / Its strong branch was broken off and it withered; / The fire consumed it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:13">19:13&nbsp;</A></B> And now it is transplanted in the wilderness, / In a dry and thirsty land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:14">19:14&nbsp;</A></B> And fire has gone forth from <I>its</I> branch; / It has consumed its offshoots <I>and</I> its fruit, / So that there is no strong branch in it, / A scepter to rule.<BR>
This is a lamentation and it has become a lamentation.<BR>
