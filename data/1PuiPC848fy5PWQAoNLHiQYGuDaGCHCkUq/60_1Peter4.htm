</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind (because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> No longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For the time which has passed is sufficient <I>for you</I> to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having gone on in licentiousness, lusts, debaucheries, carousings, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> In this they think it strange that you are not running together with <I>them</I> into the same flood of dissoluteness, slandering <I>you;</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Who will render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For unto this <I>end</I> the gospel was announced also to <I>those who are now</I> dead, that they might be judged in the flesh according to men but live in the spirit according to God.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore be sober-minded and be sober unto prayers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Above all, have fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Be hospitable to one another without murmuring,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone speaks, as <I>speaking</I> oracles of God; if anyone ministers, as <I>ministering</I> out of the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Beloved, do not think that the fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a trial, is strange, as if <I>it were</I> a strange thing happening to you;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> But inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice exultingly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> For let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler into others’ affairs;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And if the righteous man is saved <I>only</I> with difficulty, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.<BR>
