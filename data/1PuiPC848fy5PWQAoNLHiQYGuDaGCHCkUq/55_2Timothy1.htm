</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> To Timothy, beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I thank God, whom I serve from <I>my</I> forefathers in a pure conscience, while unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded <I>dwells</I> also in you.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> But now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Hold a pattern of the healthy words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B> But being in Rome, he sought me out diligently and found <I>me.</I><BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:18">&nbsp;1:18 &nbsp;</A></B> May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day. And in how many things he served <I>me</I> in Ephesus, you know best.<BR>
