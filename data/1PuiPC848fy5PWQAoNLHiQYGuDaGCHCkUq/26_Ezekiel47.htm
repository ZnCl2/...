</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:1">47:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He brought me back to the entrance of the house, and there was water flowing out from under the threshold of the house to the east (for the house faced east); and the water flowed down below the south side of the house, on the south of the altar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:2">47:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He brought me out by the way of the north gate and led me around on the way outside to the outer gate, on the way to <I>the gate</I> that faces east; and there the water was running out on the south side.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:3">47:3 &nbsp;</A></B> When the man went out to the east with the line in His hand, He measured a thousand cubits; and He led me through the water, water that was to the ankles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:4">47:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He measured a thousand <I>cubits</I> and led me through the water, water that was to the knees. Then He measured a thousand <I>cubits</I> and led me through <I>the water,</I> water that was to the loins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:5">47:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He measured a thousand <I>cubits, and it was</I> a river that I could not pass through; for the water had risen, <I>enough</I> water to swim in, a river that could not be crossed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:6">47:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to me, Son of man, have you seen <I>this?</I> Then He led me and brought me back along the bank of the river.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:7">47:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And when I returned, there were very many trees on the bank of the river, on one side and on the other.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:8">47:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Then said He to me, This water flows out toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah and goes to the sea; when it flows into the sea, the water <I>of the sea</I> is healed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:9">47:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And every living creature which swarms in every place where the river goes shall live, and there will be very many fish when this water comes there. And <I>the water of the sea</I> shall be healed, and everything shall live wherever the river comes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:10">47:10&nbsp;</A></B> And fishermen will stand beside the sea from En-gedi even to En-eglaim; it will be a place for the spreading of nets. Their fish shall be according to their kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, very many.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:11">47:11&nbsp;</A></B> But its swamps and its marshes will not be healed; they shall be left for salt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:12">47:12&nbsp;</A></B> And on the banks on both sides of the river will grow all <I>kinds</I> of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail; but they will bring forth new fruit every month, because the water for them flows out of the sanctuary. And their fruit shall be for food, and their leaves for healing.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:13">47:13&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, This is the boundary by which you shall divide up the land as an inheritance for the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall have two portions.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:14">47:14&nbsp;</A></B> And you shall divide it for an inheritance, each one equally with the other, for I swore to give it to your fathers, and this land will fall to you as an inheritance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:15">47:15&nbsp;</A></B> This shall be the border of the land: on the north side, from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Hamath, <I>and on</I> to Zedad;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:16">47:16&nbsp;</A></B> Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the territory of Damascus and the territory of Hamath), <I>to</I> Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:17">47:17&nbsp;</A></B> Thus the border shall extend from the sea <I>to</I> Hazar-enan <I>on</I> the border of <I>the territory of</I> Damascus, and on the north toward the north is the territory of Hamath. This is the north side.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:18">47:18&nbsp;</A></B> And on the east side, from between Hauran and Damascus, and from between Gilead and the land of Israel, <I>that is,</I> the Jordan, you shall measure from the <I>north</I> border to the eastern sea. This is the east side.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:19">47:19&nbsp;</A></B> And the south side toward the south, <I>the</I> <I>border shall go</I> from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah-kadesh, to the brook <I>of Egypt, and</I> to the Great Sea. This is the south side toward the south.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:20">47:20&nbsp;</A></B> And the west side <I>shall be</I> the Great Sea, from the <I>south</I> border to opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:21">47:21&nbsp;</A></B> So you shall apportion this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:22">47:22&nbsp;</A></B> And you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance among yourselves and among the sojourners who sojourn among you, who bring forth sons among you. And they shall be to you just like the native among the sons of Israel; they shall be allotted an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="47:23">47:23&nbsp;</A></B> And in whatever tribe the sojourner sojourns, you shall give <I>him</I> his inheritance there, declares the Lord Jehovah.<BR>
