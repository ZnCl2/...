</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:1">66:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / Heaven is My throne, / And the earth the footstool for My feet. / Where then is the house that you will build for Me, / And where is the place of My rest?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:2">66:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For all these things My hand has made, / And <I>so</I> all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah. / But to this kind of man will I look, to <I>him who is</I> poor / And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:3">66:3 &nbsp;</A></B> He who kills an ox is <I>like</I> him who slays a man; / He who sacrifices a lamb, <I>like</I> him who breaks a dog’s neck; / He who offers a meal offering <I>is like him who offers</I> the blood of swine; / He who burns incense is <I>like</I> him who blesses an idol. / As surely as they have chosen their own ways, / And their soul delights in their abominations;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:4">66:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Just as surely I will choose what will treat them ill, / And I will bring upon them what they dread; / Because I called, but no one answered; / I spoke, but they did not listen; / But they did evil in My sight, / And chose that in which I did not delight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:5">66:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear the word of Jehovah, / You who tremble at His word: / Your brothers who hate you, / Who cast you out because of My name, said, / Let Jehovah be glorified / So that we may see your joy. / But they will be put to shame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:6">66:6 &nbsp;</A></B> A voice of tumult from the city! / A voice from the temple! / The voice of Jehovah giving full / Recompense to His enemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:7">66:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Before she travailed, / She brought forth; / Before her pain came, / She gave birth to a man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:8">66:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Who has heard of such a thing? / Who has seen such things? / Can a land be born in one day? / Or can a nation be brought forth all at once? / For as soon as Zion travailed, / She brought forth her children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:9">66:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth? / Says Jehovah. / Or shall I who cause to bring forth shut <I>the womb?</I> / Says your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:10">66:10&nbsp;</A></B> Be joyful with Jerusalem and exult for her, / All you who love her; / Rejoice with her in joy, / All you who mourn over her,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:11">66:11&nbsp;</A></B> So that you may nurse and be satisfied / With her breasts of consolations, / So that you may draw out <I>from her</I> and take excellent delight / In the abundance of her glory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:12">66:12&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / I now am extending to her / Peace like a river, / And the glory of the nations / Like an overflowing stream; / And you will nurse, you will be carried on the hip, / And you will be bounced on the knees.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:13">66:13&nbsp;</A></B> As one whom his mother comforts, / So will I comfort you; / And you will be comforted in Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:14">66:14&nbsp;</A></B> And you will see <I>this,</I> and your heart will rejoice, / And your bones will flourish like new grass; / And the hand of Jehovah will be made known to His servants, / And He will be indignant toward His enemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:15">66:15&nbsp;</A></B> For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, / And His chariots will be like a whirlwind, / To render His anger with fury / And His rebuke with flames of fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:16">66:16&nbsp;</A></B> For with fire Jehovah will execute judgment, / And with His sword, upon all flesh; / And those slain by Jehovah will be many.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:17">66:17&nbsp;</A></B> Those who sanctify and purify themselves for the gardens, / Following after one in the midst, / Eating swine’s flesh / And what is abominable and <I>even</I> mice, / Will come to an end together, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:18">66:18&nbsp;</A></B> But I&nbsp;— their works and their thoughts <I>I will repay;</I> the time is coming to gather all the nations and tongues; and they will come and see My glory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:19">66:19&nbsp;</A></B> And I will set a sign among them and will send those who have escaped from them unto the nations: <I>to</I> Tarshish, Put, and Lud, <I>to</I> those who draw the bow; <I>to</I> Tubal and Javan, <I>to</I> the distant coastlands that have not heard My fame nor seen My glory; and they will declare My glory among the nations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:20">66:20&nbsp;</A></B> And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a meal offering to Jehovah, on horses and in chariots and in wagons and on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain, Jerusalem, says Jehovah, just as the children of Israel bring their meal offering in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:21">66:21&nbsp;</A></B> And I will also take some of them for priests <I>and</I> for Levites, says Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:22">66:22&nbsp;</A></B> For as the new heavens / And new earth, which I make, / Remain before Me, declares Jehovah, / So will your seed and your name remain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:23">66:23&nbsp;</A></B> And from new moon to new moon / And from Sabbath to Sabbath / All flesh will come / To bow down before Me, says Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="66:24">66:24&nbsp;</A></B> Then they will go forth and look / On the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; / For their worm will not die, / Nor will their fire be quenched; / And they will be an abhorrence to all flesh.<BR>
