</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:1">33:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still shut up in the court of the guard, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:2">33:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah who does it, Jehovah who formed it to establish it&nbsp;— Jehovah is His name&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:3">33:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Call unto Me, and I will answer you and tell you great and hidden things, which you do not know.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:4">33:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which were torn down <I>as a defense</I> against the siege mounds and against the sword,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:5">33:5 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>And</I> who came to fight with the Chaldeans and to fill the houses with the corpses of men whom I have struck in My anger and My wrath, and this city from which I have hidden My face because of all their wickedness:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:6">33:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I am about to bring it recovery and healing and will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:7">33:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will turn the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel and build them up as in the former time.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:8">33:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against Me, and forgive all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against Me and by which they have transgressed against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:9">33:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And it will be a name of gladness and a praise and a glory to Me before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good that I am about to do for them; and they will fear and tremble because of all the good and because of all the peace that I am about to provide for it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:10">33:10&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, Again there will be heard in this place concerning which you say, It is a waste, without man and without beast, <I>and</I> in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:11">33:11&nbsp;</A></B> The voice of gladness and the voice of joy and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and the voice of those who say, Praise Jehovah of hosts, for Jehovah is good, for His lovingkindness is forever, as they bring a <I>sacrifice of</I> thanksgiving to the house of Jehovah; for I will turn the captivity of the land, as in the former time, says Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:12">33:12&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah of hosts, Again there will be in this place which is a waste, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds making <I>their</I> flock lie down.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:13">33:13&nbsp;</A></B> In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland and in the cities of the Negev and in the land of Benjamin and all around Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, the flock will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them, says Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:14">33:14&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will establish the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:15">33:15&nbsp;</A></B> In those days and at that time I will cause a Shoot of righteousness to shoot forth unto David, and He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:16">33:16&nbsp;</A></B> In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely; and this is <I>the name</I> by which she will be called: Jehovah our righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:17">33:17&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:18">33:18&nbsp;</A></B> And the Levitical priests will never lack a man before Me to offer up a burnt offering and to offer up a meal offering and to make a sacrifice continually.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:19">33:19&nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:20">33:20&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, If you can break My covenant <I>with respect to</I> the day and My covenant <I>with respect to</I> the night, so that day and night will not be at their appointed time,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:21">33:21&nbsp;</A></B> Then also My covenant can be broken with David My servant, so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests as My ministers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:22">33:22&nbsp;</A></B> As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:23">33:23&nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:24">33:24&nbsp;</A></B> Have you not seen what this people has spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah has chosen, these He has rejected? And they despise My people, so that they are no longer a nation in their sight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:25">33:25&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, If My covenant <I>with respect to</I> day and night does not <I>stand, if</I> I have not established the statutes of heaven and earth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:26">33:26&nbsp;</A></B> Then I will also reject the seed of Jacob and David My servant and will not take rulers from his seed <I>to be</I> over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will turn their captivity and will have compassion on them.<BR>
