</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah restores / The excellency of Jacob / As the excellency of Israel; / For the emptiers have emptied them out / And destroyed their vine branches.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> In the streets the chariots rush madly; / They dash to and fro in the open squares; / Their appearance is like that of torches; / They dart like lightning.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The Assyrian king remembers his glorious ones: / They stumble in their march; / They hasten to the wall of the city, / But the <I>besiegers’</I> shelter is prepared.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Where is the den of lions / And the feeding place of young lions, / Where the lion <I>and</I> the lioness walked, / <I>And</I> the lion’s whelp; and no one frightened them?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> The lion tore in pieces, enough for his whelps, / And strangled for his lioness / And filled his caves with torn prey / And his dens with torn animals.<BR>
