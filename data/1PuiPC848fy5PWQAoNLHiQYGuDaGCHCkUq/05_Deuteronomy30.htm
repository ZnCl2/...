</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:11">30:11&nbsp;</A></B> For this commandment which I am commanding you today, it is not too difficult for you, nor is it distant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:12">30:12&nbsp;</A></B> It is not in heaven that you should say, Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us to make us hear it and do it?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:13">30:13&nbsp;</A></B> Nor is it across the sea that you should say, Who will go across the sea for us and bring it to us to make us hear it and do it?<BR>
