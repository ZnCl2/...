</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:1">28:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The wicked flee when no man pursues, / But the righteous are as bold as a lion.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:2">28:2 &nbsp;</A></B> When a land revolts, it has many rulers; / But by him who has understanding <I>and</I> knowledge it endures.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:3">28:3 &nbsp;</A></B> A destitute man who oppresses the poor / Is <I>like</I> a driving rain which leaves no food.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:4">28:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, / But those who keep the law contend with them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:5">28:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Evil men do not understand justice, / But those who seek Jehovah understand all things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:6">28:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity / Than he who is perverse in <I>his</I> ways though he is rich.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:7">28:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Whoever keeps the law is an understanding son, / But he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:8">28:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He who increases his substance by interest and usury / Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:9">28:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, / Even his prayer is an abomination.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:10">28:10&nbsp;</A></B> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way / Will himself fall into his own pit, / But the perfect will inherit good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:11">28:11&nbsp;</A></B> The rich man is wise in his own conceit, / But the poor man who has understanding searches him out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:12">28:12&nbsp;</A></B> When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; / But when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:13">28:13&nbsp;</A></B> He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, / But whoever confesses and forsakes <I>them</I> will obtain mercy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:14">28:14&nbsp;</A></B> Blessed is the man who always fears, / But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:15">28:15&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Like</I> a roaring lion and a roving bear / Is a wicked ruler over a poor people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:16">28:16&nbsp;</A></B> The ruler who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor, / <I>But</I> he who hates unjust gain will prolong <I>his</I> days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:17">28:17&nbsp;</A></B> A man who is burdened with a person’s blood / Will be a fugitive until death; / Let no man support him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:18">28:18&nbsp;</A></B> Whoever walks uprightly will be delivered, / But he who is perverse in <I>his</I> ways will fall all at once.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:19">28:19&nbsp;</A></B> He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, / But he who pursues worthless <I>things</I> will have plenty of poverty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:20">28:20&nbsp;</A></B> A faithful man will abound with blessings, / But he who makes haste to be rich will not go unpunished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:21">28:21&nbsp;</A></B> To have respect of persons is not good, / Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:22">28:22&nbsp;</A></B> A man who is envious hastens after wealth, / And does not know that want will come upon him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:23">28:23&nbsp;</A></B> He who rebukes a man will afterward find <I>more</I> favor / Than he who flatters with the tongue.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:24">28:24&nbsp;</A></B> Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, / It is no transgression, / Is the companion of a man who destroys.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:25">28:25&nbsp;</A></B> A greedy person stirs up contention, / But he who trusts in Jehovah will prosper.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:26">28:26&nbsp;</A></B> He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, / But he who walks wisely will be delivered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:27">28:27&nbsp;</A></B> He who gives to the poor man will not lack, / But he who shuts his eyes will have many curses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:28">28:28&nbsp;</A></B> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; / But when they perish, the righteous increase.<BR>
