</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:1">35:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And Josiah held the Passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the passover sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the first month.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:2">35:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And he set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:3">35:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were sanctified to Jehovah, Put the holy Ark into the house that Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel, built; it shall no longer be the burden on your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God and His people Israel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:4">35:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And prepare yourselves according to your fathers’ <I>houses</I> by your divisions according to what David the king of Israel wrote and according to the document of Solomon his son.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:5">35:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And stand in the holy place for the groups of the fathers’ houses of your brothers, the common people, and <I>let each division</I> of Levites <I>stand for</I> a portion of a father’s house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:6">35:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And slaughter the passover sacrifice, and sanctify yourselves and prepare <I>it</I> for your brothers, to act according to the word of Jehovah <I>given</I> through Moses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:7">35:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And Josiah contributed to the common people lambs and kids from the flock, all for the passover offerings, to all who were found <I>there,</I> thirty thousand <I>animals</I> in number, and three thousand cattle; these were from the king’s possessions.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:8">35:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And his officers contributed a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites; Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred <I>from the flock</I> and three hundred cattle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:9">35:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, contributed to the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand <I>from the flock</I> and five hundred cattle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:10">35:10&nbsp;</A></B> So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the command of the king.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:11">35:11&nbsp;</A></B> And they slaughtered the passover sacrifices; and while the priests sprinkled <I>the</I> <I>blood that they received</I> from their hand, the Levites flayed them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:12">35:12&nbsp;</A></B> And they removed the burnt offerings that they might give them to the groups of the fathers’ houses of the common people to offer to Jehovah, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so <I>they did</I> with the cattle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:13">35:13&nbsp;</A></B> And they roasted the passover in fire according to the ordinance, and they boiled the holy offerings in pots and in cauldrons and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the common people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:14">35:14&nbsp;</A></B> And afterward they provided for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, <I>were busy</I> offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites provided for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:15">35:15&nbsp;</A></B> And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun the king’s seer. And the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to turn from their service, for their brothers the Levites provided for them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:16">35:16&nbsp;</A></B> Thus all the service of Jehovah was prepared that same day, in order to hold the Passover and offer up burnt offerings upon the altar of Jehovah according to the command of King Josiah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:17">35:17&nbsp;</A></B> And the children of Israel who were found <I>there</I> held the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:18">35:18&nbsp;</A></B> And a Passover like that had never been held in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet, nor did any of the kings of Israel hold such a Passover as was held by Josiah and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were found <I>there</I> and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:19">35:19&nbsp;</A></B> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was held.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:20">35:20&nbsp;</A></B> After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco the king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:21">35:21&nbsp;</A></B> And Neco sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judah? <I>I have</I> not <I>come</I> up against you today but against the house with which I am at war, and God has commanded me to hurry. Refrain for your own sake from <I>interfering</I> with God, who is with me, and He will not destroy you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:22">35:22&nbsp;</A></B> But Josiah would not turn his face from him, but he disguised himself so that he might fight with him; and he did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God but came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:23">35:23&nbsp;</A></B> And the archers shot at King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I have been wounded severely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:24">35:24&nbsp;</A></B> So his servants took him out of the chariot and put him in the chariot of his second-<I>in-command,</I> and they brought him to Jerusalem; and he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:25">35:25&nbsp;</A></B> And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah. And all the male singers and female singers speak of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, for they have made <I>it</I> a custom in Israel; and they are there written in the lamentations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:26">35:26&nbsp;</A></B> Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his good deeds according to what is written in the law of Jehovah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:27">35:27&nbsp;</A></B> And his acts, first and last, are there written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.<BR>
