</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:1">15:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to me, Even though Moses and Samuel were to stand before Me, My soul would not <I>turn</I> toward this people. Send them out of My sight and let them go.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:2">15:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And when they say to you, Where shall we go? Then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah,<BR>
Those who are for death to death, / And those who are for the sword to the sword, / And those who are for famine to famine, / And those who are for captivity to captivity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:3">15:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will visit them with four kinds <I>of punishment,</I> declares Jehovah: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:4">15:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will make them a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:5">15:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem, / And who will lament for you; / And who will turn aside to ask / After your welfare?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:6">15:6 &nbsp;</A></B> You have forsaken Me, / Declares Jehovah. / You keep going backward, / And I have stretched out My hand against you / And have destroyed you; / I have become weary of repenting.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:7">15:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And I have winnowed them with a winnowing fork / In the gates of the land; / I have bereaved <I>them</I> of children / And destroyed My people; / They have not turned back from their ways.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:8">15:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Their widows have increased before Me / More than the sand of the seas; / I have brought to them, / Against the mother of the young men, / A spoiler at noon; / I have caused anguish and terror / To fall on her suddenly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:9">15:9 &nbsp;</A></B> She who has borne seven languishes; / She has breathed out her life. / Her sun has gone down while it is still day; / She is put to shame and confounded. / And the rest of them I will give up to the sword / Before their enemies, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:10">15:10&nbsp;</A></B> Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land. / I have not lent with interest, / Nor have they lent to me; / Yet everyone curses me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:11">15:11&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah said, Surely I will set you free for <I>your</I> good; / Indeed I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you / In a time of trouble and in a time of distress.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:12">15:12&nbsp;</A></B> Can one break iron, / Iron from the north, or bronze?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:13">15:13&nbsp;</A></B> Your wealth and your treasures / I will give as plunder without price, / And that for all your sins, / And within all your borders.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:14">15:14&nbsp;</A></B> I will cause your enemies to bring <I>it</I> / Into a land you do not know; / For a fire is kindled in My anger, / Which will burn against you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:15">15:15&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, You know; / Remember me and visit me, / And avenge me of my persecutors. / Do not let Your long-suffering <I>for them prevail and</I> have me taken away; / Know that for Your sake I bear reproach.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:16">15:16&nbsp;</A></B> Your words were found and I ate them, / And Your word became to me / The gladness and joy of my heart, / For I am called by Your name, / O Jehovah, God of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:17">15:17&nbsp;</A></B> I did not sit in the assembly of mockers, nor did I exult. / Because of Your hand I sat alone, / For You have filled me with indignation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:18">15:18&nbsp;</A></B> Why is my pain unceasing, / And my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? / Will You indeed be to me like a deceitful <I>brook?</I> / <I>Like</I> waters that fail?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:19">15:19&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah, / If you return, I will restore you; / You will stand before Me; / And if you bring out the precious from the worthless, / You will be as My mouth; / They will turn to you, / But you will not turn to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:20">15:20&nbsp;</A></B> And I will make you to this people / A fortified wall of bronze; / And they will fight against you, / But they will not prevail against you; / For I am with you / To save you and deliver you, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:21">15:21&nbsp;</A></B> And I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked / And redeem you from the hand of those who terrorize.<BR>
