</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> To slander no one, to be uncontentious, gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving as slaves various lusts and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But when the kindness and the love to man of our Savior God appeared,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Knowing that such a one is perverted and is sinning, though he is condemned by his own self.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos send forward diligently that nothing may be lacking to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And let those also who are ours learn to maintain respectable works for their necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.<BR>
