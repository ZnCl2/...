</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:1">81:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Sing for joy to God our strength; / Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:2">81:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Lift up a song and sound the tambourine, / The pleasant lyre with the harp.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:3">81:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Blow the trumpet at the new moon, / At the full moon, on our feast day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:4">81:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For that is a statute of Israel, / An ordinance of the God of Jacob.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:5">81:5 &nbsp;</A></B> He appointed <I>it</I> as a testimony in Joseph / When He went out over the land of Egypt. / I heard a language that I did not know:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:6">81:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I turned your shoulder from the burden; / Your hands were freed from the basket.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:7">81:7 &nbsp;</A></B> You called in trouble, and I delivered you; / I answered you from the secret place of thunder; / I proved you at the waters of Meribah. Selah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:8">81:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear, O My people, and I will testify against you: / O Israel, if you would listen to Me!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:9">81:9 &nbsp;</A></B> There shall be no strange god among you, / Neither shall you worship any foreign god.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:10">81:10&nbsp;</A></B> I am Jehovah your God, / Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt; / Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:11">81:11&nbsp;</A></B> But My people did not listen to My voice, / And Israel would not consent to Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:12">81:12&nbsp;</A></B> So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart: / They walked after their own counsels.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:13">81:13&nbsp;</A></B> Oh that My people had listened to Me, / That Israel had walked in My ways!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:14">81:14&nbsp;</A></B> I would have soon subdued their enemies / And turned My hand against their adversaries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:15">81:15&nbsp;</A></B> Those who hate Jehovah would have come cringing to Him, / And their time would be forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="81:16">81:16&nbsp;</A></B> And He would have fed them with the finest of wheat; / Indeed with honey from the rock I would have satisfied you.<BR>
