</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:1">34:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Draw near, O nations, to hear; / And listen, O peoples! / Let the earth and all that fills it hear, / The world and all that springs forth from it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:2">34:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah’s indignation is upon all the nations, / And <I>His</I> wrath is upon all their armies; / He has utterly destroyed them; / He has delivered them unto the slaughter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:3">34:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus their slain are cast away, / And <I>from</I> their corpses their stench will come up; / And the mountains will be melted with their blood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:4">34:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And all the armies of heaven will be dissolved, / And the heavens will be rolled up like a scroll, / And all their host will wither away, / As the leaf withers from the vine, / Or like a <I>leaf</I> withering from the fig tree.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:5">34:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For My sword has drunk its fill in heaven. / Now it will descend in judgment upon Edom / And upon the people whom I have devoted to judgment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:6">34:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah’s sword is full of blood; / It has fattened itself with fat, / With the blood of lambs and goats, / With the fat of the kidneys of rams; / For Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah / And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:7">34:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Wild oxen will also go down with them, / The young bulls with the bulls; / And their land will drink its fill of <I>their</I> blood, / And their dust will become fat with <I>their</I> fat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:8">34:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah has a day of vengeance, / A year of recompense for Zion’s contention.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:9">34:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And its streams will be turned into pitch, / And its dust into brimstone; / And its land will become burning pitch.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:10">34:10&nbsp;</A></B> It will not be quenched by night or by day; / Its smoke will go up forever; / It will be desolate from generation to generation; / No one will pass through it forever and ever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:11">34:11&nbsp;</A></B> But the pelican and the porcupine will inherit it, / And the owl and the raven will dwell in it; / And He will stretch over it / The line of nothingness and the plummet weights of emptiness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:12">34:12&nbsp;</A></B> As for its nobles, there is no one there whom they may call to <I>assume</I> the / kingdom, / And all its princes will be nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:13">34:13&nbsp;</A></B> And thorns will come up in its citadels, / Nettles and thistles in its fortified cities; / And it will be a habitation for jackals, / And an abode for ostriches.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:14">34:14&nbsp;</A></B> Desert animals will meet with hyenas; / And the demon will call to his kind, / Indeed there Lilith will settle / And find a resting place for herself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:15">34:15&nbsp;</A></B> There the owl will make its nest and lay eggs, / And hatch <I>them</I> and gather <I>them</I> under its protection; / Indeed there the vultures will be gathered together, / Each with its kind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:16">34:16&nbsp;</A></B> Seek from the book of Jehovah and read. / Not one of these will be missing; / Not one will lack her mate; / For His mouth has commanded <I>it,</I> / And it is His Spirit who has gathered them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="34:17">34:17&nbsp;</A></B> And He has cast the lot for them, / And His hand has divided it by line unto them; / They will inherit it forever; / From generation to generation they will dwell in it.<BR>
