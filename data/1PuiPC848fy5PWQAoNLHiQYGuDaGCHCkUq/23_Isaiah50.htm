</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:1">50:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce / With which I have put her away? / Or to which of My creditors / Have I sold you? / Indeed, for your iniquities you were sold, / And for your transgressions your mother was put away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:2">50:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Why <I>when</I> I came was there no man? / <I>And when</I> I called <I>why</I> was there no one to answer? / Is My hand so short that it cannot redeem? / Or do I have no power to deliver? / Indeed, at My rebuke I dry up the sea; / I make the rivers a wilderness; / Their fish stink because there is no water, / And die of thirst.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:3">50:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I clothe the heavens with blackness, / And make sackcloth their covering.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:4">50:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord Jehovah has given me / The tongue of the instructed, / That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. / He awakens<I> me</I> morning by morning; / He awakens my ear / To hear as an instructed one.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:5">50:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord Jehovah has opened my ear; / And I was not rebellious, / Nor did I turn back.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:6">50:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I gave my back to those who strike <I>me</I> / And my cheeks to those who pluck out <I>the hair;</I> / I did not hide my face / From humiliation and spitting.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:7">50:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord Jehovah helps me; / Therefore I have not been dishonored; / Therefore I have set my face like a flint, / And I know that I will not be put to shame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:8">50:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The One who justifies me is near; who will contend with me? / Let us stand up together! / Who is my adversary in judgment? / Let him come near to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:9">50:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, the Lord Jehovah helps me, / Who is the one who condemns me? / Indeed, they will all wear out like a garment; / The moth will consume them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:10">50:10&nbsp;</A></B> Who among you fears Jehovah; / Who hears the voice of His servant; / Who walks in darkness / And has no light? / Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, / And rely on his God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:11">50:11&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, all of you who kindle a fire, / Who surround yourselves with firebrands, / Walk into the light of your fire / And into the firebrands which you have lit. / You will have this from My hand: / You will lie down in torment.<BR>
