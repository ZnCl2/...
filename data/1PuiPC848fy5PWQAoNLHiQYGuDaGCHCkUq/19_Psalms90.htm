</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:1">90:1 &nbsp;</A></B> O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:2">90:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Before the mountains were brought forth, / And <I>before</I> You gave birth to the earth and the world, / Indeed from eternity to eternity, You are God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:3">90:3 &nbsp;</A></B> You return man to dust / And say, Return, you sons of men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:4">90:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For a thousand years in Your sight / Are like yesterday when it passes by / And <I>like</I> a watch in the night.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:5">90:5 &nbsp;</A></B> You sweep them away as with a rain flood; they are <I>as in</I> a sleep: / In the morning <I>they are</I> like grass that comes up anew.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:6">90:6 &nbsp;</A></B> In the morning it flourishes and comes up anew; / In the evening it is cut down, and it dries up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:7">90:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For we have been consumed by Your anger, / And by Your wrath we have been troubled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:8">90:8 &nbsp;</A></B> You have set our iniquities before You, / Our secret <I>sins</I> in the light of Your countenance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:9">90:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For all our days have passed away in Your overflowing wrath; / We bring our years to an end like a sigh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:10">90:10&nbsp;</A></B> The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years; / But their pride is labor and sorrow, / For it is soon gone, and we fly away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:11">90:11&nbsp;</A></B> Who knows the power of Your anger, / And Your overflowing wrath according to the fear that is due You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:12">90:12&nbsp;</A></B> Teach us then to number our days / That we may gain a heart of wisdom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:13">90:13&nbsp;</A></B> Return, O Jehovah! How long? / And repent concerning Your servants.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:14">90:14&nbsp;</A></B> Satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness / That we may give a ringing shout and rejoice all our days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:15">90:15&nbsp;</A></B> Cause us to rejoice according to the days that You have afflicted us, / <I>According to</I> the years that we have seen evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:16">90:16&nbsp;</A></B> Let Your work appear to Your servants, / And Your splendor, to their children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="90:17">90:17&nbsp;</A></B> And let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, / And establish the work of our hands upon us; / Indeed the work of our hands, establish it.<BR>
