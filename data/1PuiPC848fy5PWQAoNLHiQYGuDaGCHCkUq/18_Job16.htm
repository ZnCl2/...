</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:1">16:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:2">16:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I have heard many such things; / Troubling comforters are you all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:3">16:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Do words of wind have an end? / Or what has provoked you that you <I>so</I> respond?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:4">16:4 &nbsp;</A></B> I also could speak like you, / If your soul were in my soul’s stead; / I could join <I>my</I> words together against you / And shake my head at you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:5">16:5 &nbsp;</A></B> I could strengthen you with my mouth, / And the movement of my lips would mitigate <I>your pain.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:6">16:6 &nbsp;</A></B> If I speak, my pain is not mitigated; / And if I forbear, how much departs from me?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:7">16:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But now He has worn me out; / You have desolated all my company.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:8">16:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And You have seized me; it is a testimony <I>against me;</I> / And my leanness rises up against me; it testifies to my face.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:9">16:9 &nbsp;</A></B> In His wrath He has torn <I>me</I> to pieces and been adverse toward me; / He has gnashed His teeth at me. / My Adversary sharpens His eyes at me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:10">16:10&nbsp;</A></B> With their mouth they gape at me; / They strike my cheek reproachfully; / They mass themselves together against me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:11">16:11&nbsp;</A></B> God has delivered me over to the unjust / And cast me down into the hands of the wicked.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:12">16:12&nbsp;</A></B> I was at ease, and He broke me apart; / Indeed He took me by my neck and dashed me to pieces. / And He set me up as His target;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:13">16:13&nbsp;</A></B>  His archers surrounded me; / He split open my kidneys and did not desist; / He poured out my gall upon the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:14">16:14&nbsp;</A></B> He broke me open with breach upon breach; / He ran at me like a mighty man <I>of war.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:15">16:15&nbsp;</A></B> I have sewn sackcloth upon my skin / And have cast my horn into the dust.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:16">16:16&nbsp;</A></B> My face is reddened with weeping, / And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:17">16:17&nbsp;</A></B> Though there is no violence in my hands, / And my prayer is pure.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:18">16:18&nbsp;</A></B> O earth, do not cover my blood; / And let there be no <I>resting</I> place for my crying out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:19">16:19&nbsp;</A></B> Even now, there in heaven is my Witness, / And He who vouches for me is in the heights.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:20">16:20&nbsp;</A></B> My friends deride me; / My eye pours out tears to God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:21">16:21&nbsp;</A></B> That He would plead for a man <I>in his case</I> with God / And for a son of man <I>in his case</I> with his neighbor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:22">16:22&nbsp;</A></B> For when years <I>few</I> in number have come, / I will go the way from which I cannot return.<BR>
