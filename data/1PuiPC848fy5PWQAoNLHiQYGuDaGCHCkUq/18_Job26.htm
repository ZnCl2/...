</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:1">26:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:2">26:2 &nbsp;</A></B> How you have helped him who is without power! / How you have saved the arm of him who is without strength!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:3">26:3 &nbsp;</A></B> How you have counseled him who is without wisdom / And have plentifully declared sound knowledge!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:4">26:4 &nbsp;</A></B> To whom have you uttered words? / And whose spirit has come forth from you?<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:5">26:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The deceased are made to tremble / Beneath the waters, and those who inhabit them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:6">26:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Sheol is naked before Him, / And Abaddon has no covering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:7">26:7 &nbsp;</A></B> He stretches out the north over the void; / He hangs the earth upon nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:8">26:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He binds up the waters in His thick clouds, / And the cloud is not rent under them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:9">26:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He covers the face of <I>His</I> throne; / He spreads His cloud over it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:10">26:10&nbsp;</A></B> He drew a circle on the surface of the waters / As a boundary of the light and the darkness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:11">26:11&nbsp;</A></B> The pillars of heaven shook / And were astounded at His rebuke.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:12">26:12&nbsp;</A></B> By His power He stilled the sea, / And by His understanding He struck down Rahab.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:13">26:13&nbsp;</A></B> By His Spirit the heavens became beauty; / His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:14">26:14&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; / And how small a whisper do we hear of Him! / But as for the thundering of His mightiness, who can comprehend <I>it?</I><BR>
