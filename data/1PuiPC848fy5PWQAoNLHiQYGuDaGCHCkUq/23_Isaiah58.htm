</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:1">58:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Cry loudly; do not hold back; / Raise your voice like a trumpet, / And declare to My people their transgression / And to the house of Jacob their sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:2">58:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet they seek Me day by day / And take delight in knowing My ways, / Like a nation that has done righteousness / And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. / They ask Me for righteous judgments; / They take delight in approaching God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:3">58:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Why have we fasted, and yet You do not see? / <I>Why</I> have we afflicted our soul, and yet You do not acknowledge? / Indeed, on the day of your fast you find delight, / And oppress all your laborers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:4">58:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, you fast for contention and strife, / And to strike with a fist of wickedness; / You do not fast, in the way <I>you do</I> today, / To make your voice heard on high.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:5">58:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Is such the fast that I choose, / The day when a man afflicts his soul? / Is it for bowing his head like a rush / And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as his bed? / Will you call this a fast, / And an acceptable day to Jehovah?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:6">58:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Is this not the fast that I choose, / To loosen the bonds of wickedness, / To undo the bands of the yoke, / And to let the oppressed go free, / And to break every yoke?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:7">58:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Is it not to divide your bread to the hungry, / And to bring the wandering poor home; / When you see the naked, to cover him, / And not to hide yourself from your own flesh?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:8">58:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Then your light will break forth like the dawn, / And your recovery will speedily spring forth. / And your righteousness will go before you; / The glory of Jehovah will guard you from behind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:9">58:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then you will call, and Jehovah will answer; / You will cry out, and He will say, Here I am.<BR>

If you remove the yoke from your midst, / The pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:10">58:10&nbsp;</A></B> And if you draw out your soul to the hungry / And satisfy the desires of the afflicted; / Then your light will rise in the darkness, / And your gloom will be like midday;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:11">58:11&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will guide you continually, / And satisfy your soul in the dry times, / And strengthen your bones; / And you will be like a watered garden, / And like a spring of water, / Whose waters do not deceive.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:12">58:12&nbsp;</A></B> And those who are of you will rebuild the ancient ruins; / You will raise up the foundations of generation upon generation; / And you will be called the repairer of the breach, / The restorer of the paths in which to dwell.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:13">58:13&nbsp;</A></B> If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, / From doing whatever you please on My holy day, / And call the Sabbath a delight, / That which is holy to Jehovah honorable, / And honor it, not doing your own ways, / Nor finding your own pleasure and speaking <I>idle</I> words;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="58:14">58:14&nbsp;</A></B> Then you will have delight in Jehovah; / And I will cause you to ride upon the heights of the earth, / And I will feed you <I>with</I> the inheritance of Jacob your father; / For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.<BR>
