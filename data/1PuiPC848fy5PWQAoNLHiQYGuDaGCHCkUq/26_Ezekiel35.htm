</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:1">35:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:2">35:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:3">35:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And say to it, Thus says the Lord Jehovah,<BR>
Indeed I am against you, O Mount Seir, / And I will stretch out My hand against you / And make you a desolation and a waste.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:4">35:4 &nbsp;</A></B> I will lay your cities waste, / And you will be desolate; / And you will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:5">35:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Because you have had a perpetual enmity and handed the children of Israel over to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, in the time of the punishment of the end;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:6">35:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare you for blood, and blood will pursue you; since you have not hated bloodshed, therefore bloodshed will pursue you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:7">35:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus I will make Mount Seir a waste and a desolation, and I will cut off from it him who passes through and him who returns.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:8">35:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will fill its mountains with its slain. The slain will fall by the sword in your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:9">35:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:10">35:10&nbsp;</A></B> Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries will belong to me, and we will possess them&nbsp;— even though Jehovah was there&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:11">35:11&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will deal <I>with you</I> according to your anger and according to your jealousy, which you displayed in your hatred of them, and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:12">35:12&nbsp;</A></B> And you will know that I, Jehovah, have heard all your reviling which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are desolate; they have been given to us to devour.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:13">35:13&nbsp;</A></B> And you have magnified yourselves against Me with your mouth and multiplied your words against Me; I have heard.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:14">35:14&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:15">35:15&nbsp;</A></B> As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You will be desolate, O Mount Seir and all Edom, the whole land. Then they will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
