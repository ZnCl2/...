</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:1">65:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I let Myself be inquired of by those who did not ask <I>for Me,</I> / And found by those who did not seek Me. / I said, Here I am; here I am; / To a nation that was not called by My name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:2">65:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I have stretched out My hands all day long / To a rebellious people, / Who walk in a way that is not good, / After their own thoughts;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:3">65:3 &nbsp;</A></B> A people who provoke Me to anger / To My face continually, / Who sacrifice in gardens / And burn incense upon the bricks;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:4">65:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Who sit among the graves / And lodge overnight in the secret places; / Who eat swine’s flesh / And the broth of abominations in their pots;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:5">65:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Who say, Keep to yourself, / Do not come near me; for I am holier than you. / These are smoke in My nose, / A fire that burns all day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:6">65:6 &nbsp;</A></B> It is written here before Me: / I will not keep silent without first recompensing; / And I will recompense, into their bosom,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:7">65:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, / Says Jehovah, / Who have burned incense upon the mountains / And have scorned Me upon the hills; / Therefore I will measure their work first / Into their bosom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:8">65:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / As the new wine is found in the cluster, / And someone says, Do not destroy it, / For there is a blessing in it; / So will I do for My servants’ sake, / In order not to destroy them all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:9">65:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, / And out of Judah one who will possess My mountain; / And My chosen ones will possess it, / And My servants will dwell there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:10">65:10&nbsp;</A></B> And Sharon will be an abode for the flock, / And the valley of Achor a resting place for the herd, / For My people who have sought Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:11">65:11&nbsp;</A></B> But you who forsake Jehovah, / Who forget My holy mountain, / Who prepare a table to Fortune / And fill <I>vessels</I> with drink offerings to Destiny,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:12">65:12&nbsp;</A></B> I will destine you to the sword, / And you all will bow down to the slaughter; / Because I called you, but you did not answer; / I spoke, but you did not listen; / But you did evil in My sight / And chose that in which I did not delight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:13">65:13&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, / Indeed, My servants shall eat, / But you shall hunger; / Indeed, My servants shall drink, / But you shall thirst; / Indeed, My servants shall rejoice, / But you shall be put to shame;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:14">65:14&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, My servants shall give a ringing shout / Because of a heart of joy, / But you shall cry out / Because of a heart of pain, / And because of a broken spirit you shall wail.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:15">65:15&nbsp;</A></B> And you will leave your name as a curse to My chosen ones, / And the Lord Jehovah will slay you; / And He will call His servants by another name,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:16">65:16&nbsp;</A></B> So that he who blesses himself in the earth / Will bless himself in the God of faithfulness, / And he who swears in the earth / Will swear by the God of faithfulness; / Because the former troubles are forgotten / And because they are hidden from My sight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:17">65:17&nbsp;</A></B> For I am now creating new heavens / And a new earth, / And the former things will not be remembered, / Nor will they come up in the heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:18">65:18&nbsp;</A></B> But rejoice and exult forever, / In what I create, / For I am now creating Jerusalem as an exultation / And her people as a rejoicing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:19">65:19&nbsp;</A></B> And I will exult in Jerusalem / And rejoice in My people; / And there will no longer be heard in her / The voice of weeping and the voice of crying.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:20">65:20&nbsp;</A></B> There will no longer be in her / An infant <I>who reaches the age of only</I> a few days / Nor an old man who does not fill up his days; / For the lad will die at a hundred years of age, / And the sinner, being a hundred years of age, will be cursed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:21">65:21&nbsp;</A></B> And they will build houses and inhabit <I>them,</I> / And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:22">65:22&nbsp;</A></B> They will not build and another inhabit; / They will not plant and another eat; / For like the days of a tree are the days of My people, / And My chosen ones will enjoy the work of their hands to the full;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:23">65:23&nbsp;</A></B> They will not labor in vain, / Nor bear children unto turmoil; / For they are the seed of those blessed of Jehovah, / And their offspring with them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:24">65:24&nbsp;</A></B> And it will be that before they call, I will answer; / Even while they are speaking, I will hear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="65:25">65:25&nbsp;</A></B> The wolf and the lamb will feed as one, / And the lion will eat straw like the ox, / And dust will be the serpent’s food; / They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.<BR>
