</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:6">25:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was still living, eastward to the east country.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:7">25:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, one hundred seventy-five years.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:8">25:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full <I>of days,</I> and he was gathered to his people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:9">25:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which faces Mamre,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:10">25:10&nbsp;</A></B> The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:11">25:11&nbsp;</A></B> And after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:12">25:12&nbsp;</A></B> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s female servant, bore to Abraham.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:13">25:13&nbsp;</A></B> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:14">25:14&nbsp;</A></B> And Mishma and Dumah and Massa;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:15">25:15&nbsp;</A></B> Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:16">25:16&nbsp;</A></B> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their peoples.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:17">25:17&nbsp;</A></B> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred thirty-seven years. And he expired and died and was gathered to his people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:18">25:18&nbsp;</A></B> And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which faces Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He settled down opposite all his brothers.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:19">25:19&nbsp;</A></B> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begot Isaac.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:20">25:20&nbsp;</A></B> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramaean, to be his wife.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:21">25:21&nbsp;</A></B> And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:22">25:22&nbsp;</A></B> And the children struggled with each other within her. And she said, If it is so, why am I <I>like this?</I> And she went to inquire of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:23">25:23&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to her,<BR>
Two nations are in your womb, / And two peoples shall be separated from your bowels. / And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. / And the older shall serve the younger.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:24">25:24&nbsp;</A></B> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:25">25:25&nbsp;</A></B> And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:26">25:26&nbsp;</A></B> And after that his brother came forth, and his hand was holding on to Esau’s heel, so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:27">25:27&nbsp;</A></B> And when the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:28">25:28&nbsp;</A></B> Now Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:29">25:29&nbsp;</A></B> And Jacob cooked a stew. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:30">25:30&nbsp;</A></B> And Esau said to Jacob, Let me swallow down some of the red <I>stew,</I> that red <I>stew there,</I> for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:31">25:31&nbsp;</A></B> And Jacob said, First sell me your birthright.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:32">25:32&nbsp;</A></B> And Esau said, I am now about to die. Of what use then is this birthright to me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:33">25:33&nbsp;</A></B> And Jacob said, First swear to me. And he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:34">25:34&nbsp;</A></B> And Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.<BR>
