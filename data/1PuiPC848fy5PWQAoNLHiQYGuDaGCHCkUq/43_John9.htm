</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but <I>he was born so,</I> that the works of God might be manifested in him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went therefore and washed and came <I>away</I> seeing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am <I>the one.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> They said then to him, How then were your eyes opened?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the <I>pool</I> of Siloam and wash. I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Now it was the Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man <I>who is</I> a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Then they said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him, in that He opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:18">&nbsp;9:18 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews then did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:19">&nbsp;9:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And asked them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:20">&nbsp;9:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Then his parents answered <I>them</I> and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:21">&nbsp;9:21 &nbsp;</A></B> But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:22">&nbsp;9:22 &nbsp;</A></B> His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him <I>to be the</I> Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:23">&nbsp;9:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of this his parents said, He is of age; question him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:24">&nbsp;9:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:25">&nbsp;9:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Then he answered, Whether <I>or not</I> He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:26">&nbsp;9:26 &nbsp;</A></B> They said then to him, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:27">&nbsp;9:27 &nbsp;</A></B> He answered them, I told you already and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear <I>it</I> again? Do you also want to become His disciples?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:28">&nbsp;9:28 &nbsp;</A></B> And they reviled him and said, You are His disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:29">&nbsp;9:29 &nbsp;</A></B> We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:30">&nbsp;9:30 &nbsp;</A></B> The man answered and said to them, Why here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and <I>yet</I> He opened my eyes!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:31">&nbsp;9:31 &nbsp;</A></B> We know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:32">&nbsp;9:32 &nbsp;</A></B>  Since time began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:33">&nbsp;9:33 &nbsp;</A></B> If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:34">&nbsp;9:34 &nbsp;</A></B> They answered and said to him, You were wholly born in sins, and you are teaching us? And they cast him out.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:35">&nbsp;9:35 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and He found him and said, Do you believe into the Son of God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:36">&nbsp;9:36 &nbsp;</A></B> He answered and said, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:37">&nbsp;9:37 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:38">&nbsp;9:38 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said, Lord, I believe; and he worshipped Him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:39">&nbsp;9:39 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:40">&nbsp;9:40 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Some</I> of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not blind also, are we?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:41">&nbsp;9:41 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now <I>that</I> you say, We see; your sin remains.<BR>
