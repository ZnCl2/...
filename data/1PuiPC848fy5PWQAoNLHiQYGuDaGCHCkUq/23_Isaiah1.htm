</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <I>and</I> Hezekiah, the kings of Judah:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear, O heavens, and hearken, O earth, / For Jehovah has spoken: / I have brought up children, and I have raised <I>them;</I> / And <I>yet</I> they have rebelled against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The ox knows his owner, / And the donkey, his master’s manger; / <I>But</I> Israel does not know, / My people do not much consider.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Alas, sinful nation, / A people heavy with iniquity, / Seed of evildoers, / Children acting corruptly! / They have forsaken Jehovah; / They have despised the Holy One of Israel; / They have become estranged <I>and have gone</I> backward.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Where will you be stricken again? / Will you continue <I>your</I> apostasy? / The whole head has become sick, / And the whole heart faint;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> From the sole of the foot even to the head, / There is no soundness in it, / <I>Only</I> bruises and blows / And raw wounds&nbsp;— / They have not been pressed out nor bound up / Nor softened with oil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Your land is a desolation; / Your cities are burned with fire; / Your field&nbsp;— in your sight / Strangers devour it; / It is a desolation, like something overthrown by strangers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the daughter of Zion is left / Like a booth in a vineyard, / Like a hut in a cucumber field, / Like a besieged city.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Unless Jehovah of hosts / Had left to us a surviving few, / We would have been like Sodom, / We would have resembled Gomorrah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear the word of Jehovah, / You rulers of Sodom; / Hearken to the instruction of our God, / You people of Gomorrah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> What is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? / Says Jehovah. / I have had My fill of burnt offerings of rams / And the fat of fed cattle; / The blood of bulls and lambs / And goats, I do not delight in.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> When you come to appear before Me, / Who has required this of your hand, / To trample My courts?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Bring no more vain offerings; / Incense is an abomination to Me. / New moon and Sabbath, the calling of convocations&nbsp;— / I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn assembly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Your new moons and your appointed feasts / My soul hates; / They have become a burden on Me; / I am weary of bearing <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus, when you spread forth your hands, / I will hide My eyes from you; / Even though you multiply <I>your</I> prayers, / I will not hear. / Your hands are full of blood;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B>  Wash yourselves; cleanse yourselves. / Turn away the evil of your deeds / From before My eyes. / Cease doing what is evil;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B>  Learn to do good. / Seek justice; / Correct the ruthless. / Defend the orphan; / Plead for the widow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:18">&nbsp;1:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Come now and let us reason together, / Says Jehovah. / Though your sins are like scarlet, / They will be as white as snow; / Though they are as red as crimson, / They will be like wool.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:19">&nbsp;1:19 &nbsp;</A></B> If you are willing and listen, / You will eat the good of the land;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:20">&nbsp;1:20 &nbsp;</A></B> But if you refuse and rebel, / You will be devoured by the sword; / For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:21">&nbsp;1:21 &nbsp;</A></B> How the faithful city / Has become a harlot! / She who was full of justice, / She in whom righteousness <I>once</I> lodged, / But now murderers!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:22">&nbsp;1:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Your silver has become dross; / Your wine diluted with water;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:23">&nbsp;1:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Your rulers are rebellious / And companions of thieves; / They all love bribes / And chase after rewards; / They do not defend the orphan, / Nor does the widow’s plea come before them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:24">&nbsp;1:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Hence, the Lord Jehovah of hosts, / The Mighty One of Israel, declares: / Ah, I will ease Myself of My adversaries, / And I will avenge Myself of My enemies;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:25">&nbsp;1:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will turn My hand against you. / I will thoroughly purge away your dross as with lye, / And I will remove all your alloy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:26">&nbsp;1:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will restore your judges as at the first / And your counselors as at the beginning. / Afterward you will be called the city of righteousness, / The faithful city.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:27">&nbsp;1:27 &nbsp;</A></B> Zion will be ransomed with justice, / And her returning ones with righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:28">&nbsp;1:28 &nbsp;</A></B> And <I>there will be</I> the shattering of rebels and sinners together, / And those who forsake Jehovah will meet their end.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:29">&nbsp;1:29 &nbsp;</A></B> For you will be ashamed of the terebinths / That you have taken pleasure in; / And you will be embarrassed at the gardens / That you have chosen.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:30">&nbsp;1:30 &nbsp;</A></B> For you will be like a terebinth / Whose leaves are falling, / And like a garden / In which there is no water;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:31">&nbsp;1:31 &nbsp;</A></B> And the strong man will become tow, / And his work a spark; / And they will both burn together, / And there will be none to extinguish <I>them.</I><BR>
