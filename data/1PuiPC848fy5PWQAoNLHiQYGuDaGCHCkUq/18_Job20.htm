</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:1">20:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:2">20:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of this, my disquieting thoughts answer me; / And hence my haste is in me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:3">20:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I hear the reproof that humiliates me, / And the spirit of my understanding answers me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:4">20:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Do you not know this from of old, / Since man was set upon the earth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:5">20:5 &nbsp;</A></B> That the joyous shouting of the wicked is short, / And the rejoicing of the profane is but for a moment?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:6">20:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Though his arrogance goes up to heaven, / And his head touches the clouds;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:7">20:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Like his own dung he perishes forever; / Those who have seen him say, Where is he?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:8">20:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Like a dream he flies away and is not found; / Indeed he is chased away like a vision of the night.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:9">20:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The eye looks on him then <I>sees him</I> no more, / Nor does his place observe him anymore.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:10">20:10&nbsp;</A></B> His children seek the favor of the poor, / And his hands return his wealth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:11">20:11&nbsp;</A></B> His bones are full of youthful vigor, / Yet it lies down with him in the dust.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:12">20:12&nbsp;</A></B> Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, / <I>Though</I> he hides it under his tongue,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:13">20:13&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Though</I> he favors it and will not forsake it, / But holds it in his mouth;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:14">20:14&nbsp;</A></B> His food in his bowels is changed; / It is the venom of asps within him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:15">20:15&nbsp;</A></B> He swallows down riches and vomits them up; / God casts them forth from his stomach.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:16">20:16&nbsp;</A></B> He sucks the poison of asps; / The tongue of the viper slays him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:17">20:17&nbsp;</A></B> He will not look on the rivers, / The streams flowing with honey and butter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:18">20:18&nbsp;</A></B> He will return what he toiled for and will not swallow <I>it</I> down; / And he will not rejoice according to the wealth of his trading.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:19">20:19&nbsp;</A></B> For he has oppressed <I>and</I> abandoned the poor; / He has violently seized a house that he did not build.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:20">20:20&nbsp;</A></B> Because he knew no respite in his craving, / Of that which he desired he will save nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:21">20:21&nbsp;</A></B> There will be nothing left of what he has devoured; / Thus his prosperity will not endure.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:22">20:22&nbsp;</A></B> In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be distressed; / The hand of everyone in trouble will come against him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:23">20:23&nbsp;</A></B> In order to fill his belly, / God will send the burning fierceness of His wrath on him / And will rain <I>it</I> upon him as his food.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:24">20:24&nbsp;</A></B> He will flee from the iron weapon, / <I>But</I> the bronze bow will strike him through.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:25">20:25&nbsp;</A></B> He draws <I>the arrow</I> out, and it comes out of his body; / Indeed the glittering point goes forth from his gall. / Terrors <I>come</I> upon him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:26">20:26&nbsp;</A></B> Total darkness is laid up as his treasures; / A fire not fanned <I>by man</I> will devour him; / It will feed on what is left in his tent.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:27">20:27&nbsp;</A></B> The heavens will reveal his iniquity, / And the earth will rise up against him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:28">20:28&nbsp;</A></B> The increase of his house will depart / As things swept away in the day of His wrath.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="20:29">20:29&nbsp;</A></B> This is the wicked man’s portion from God / And the inheritance decreed to him by God.<BR>
