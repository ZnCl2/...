</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:1">11:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And there was given to me a reed like a rod, <I>and someone</I> said, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:2">11:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:5">11:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:6">11:6 &nbsp;</A></B> These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:7">11:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And when they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and kill them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:10">11:10&nbsp;</A></B> And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:11">11:11&nbsp;</A></B> And after the three and a half days, the breath of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:12">11:12&nbsp;</A></B> And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:13">11:13&nbsp;</A></B> And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:14">11:14&nbsp;</A></B> The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:15">11:15&nbsp;</A></B> And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the <I>kingdom</I> of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.<BR>
