</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:1">22:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:2">22:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Now you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Therefore make her know all her abominations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:3">22:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, A city that sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that makes idols, against her <I>own good,</I> that she may defile herself!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:4">22:4 &nbsp;</A></B> You are guilty for the blood which you have shed and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near and have come to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the countries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:5">22:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Those who are near and those who are far off from you will mock you, who are ill-reputed <I>and</I> in great tumult.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:6">22:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed the princes of Israel, each according to his power, were within you to shed blood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:7">22:7 &nbsp;</A></B> They have lightly esteemed father and mother within you; they have treated the stranger with oppression in the midst of you, and the orphan and the widow they have ill-treated within you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:8">22:8 &nbsp;</A></B> You have despised My holy things and have profaned My Sabbaths.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:9">22:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Slanderous men are within you in order to shed blood, and within you they have eaten upon the mountains; in the midst of you they have committed lewdness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:10">22:10&nbsp;</A></B> In you they have uncovered the nakedness of <I>their</I> father; they have humbled women in their uncleanness within you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:11">22:11&nbsp;</A></B> And one has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife, and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law, and another has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter, within you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:12">22:12&nbsp;</A></B> Within you they have taken bribes in order to shed blood; you have taken interest and increase and have wrested unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion and have forgotten Me, declares the Lord Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:13">22:13&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I have now struck My hand against your wrested unjust gain which you have made and at the bloodshed which is in the midst of you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:14">22:14&nbsp;</A></B> Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days when I will deal with you? I, Jehovah, have spoken, and I will do <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:15">22:15&nbsp;</A></B> And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the countries, and I will consume your uncleanness from you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:16">22:16&nbsp;</A></B> And you will be profaned through yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:17">22:17&nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:18">22:18&nbsp;</A></B> Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; all of them are bronze and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:19">22:19&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because all of you have become dross, therefore I am now gathering you into the midst of Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:20">22:20&nbsp;</A></B> As they gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow fire upon it <I>and</I> smelt <I>it,</I> so will I gather <I>you</I> in My anger and in My wrath; and I will lay <I>you there</I> and smelt you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:21">22:21&nbsp;</A></B> Yes, I will gather you and blow upon you with the fire of My overflowing wrath, and you will be smelted in the midst of it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:22">22:22&nbsp;</A></B> As silver is smelted in the midst of the furnace, so will you be smelted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, Jehovah, have poured out My wrath upon you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:23">22:23&nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:24">22:24&nbsp;</A></B> Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed or rained upon in the day of indignation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:25">22:25&nbsp;</A></B> There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her, like a roaring lion taking prey: They have devoured souls; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have increased <I>the number of</I> her widows in the midst of her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:26">22:26&nbsp;</A></B> Her priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, nor have they made <I>the difference</I> known between the unclean and the clean; and from My Sabbaths they have hidden their eyes; and I am profaned in the midst of them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:27">22:27&nbsp;</A></B> Her rulers within her are like wolves taking prey, by shedding blood <I>and</I> destroying souls in order to wrest unjust gain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:28">22:28&nbsp;</A></B> And her prophets have plastered over <I>their deeds</I> with untempered mortar for them, seeing vain visions and deceptive divination for them, saying, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:29">22:29&nbsp;</A></B> The people of the land have practiced extortion and have committed plunder and have oppressed the poor and needy and have mistreated the stranger without justice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:30">22:30&nbsp;</A></B> And I sought a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the breach before Me for the sake of the land so that I would not destroy it, but I found no one.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:31">22:31&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I have poured out My indignation upon them; in the fire of My overflowing wrath I have consumed them; I have brought their own way upon their heads, declares the Lord Jehovah.<BR>
