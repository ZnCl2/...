</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> If you will return, O Israel, declares Jehovah, / Return to Me; / And if you put away your detestable things from My presence / And do not wander,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And swear, As Jehovah lives, / In truth and in justice and in righteousness, / Then the nations will bless themselves in Him, / And in Him they will glory.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, / Break up your fallow ground, / And do not sow among thorns.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, / And remove the foreskins of your heart, / Men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, / Lest My wrath go forth like fire / And burn, and there be no one to quench it / Because of the evil of your deeds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Declare in Judah / And proclaim in Jerusalem, and say: / Blow the trumpet in the land; / Cry aloud and say, / Gather yourselves and let us go / Into the fortified cities.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Raise up a standard toward Zion. / Seek refuge; do not stay; / For I am bringing evil from the north, / And great destruction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> A lion has come up from his thicket, / And a destroyer of nations has set out. / He has gone forth from his place / To make your land a waste; / Your cities will be ruins, / Without an inhabitant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For this, gird yourselves with sackcloth, / Wail and howl; / For the burning anger of Jehovah / Has not turned away from us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And in that day, declares Jehovah, the heart of the king and the heart of the princes will fail; and the priests will be appalled, and the prophets will be astounded.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah, surely You have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You will have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of My people, not for winnowing nor for purging<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> (A wind too strong for these), will come from Me; now I will also utter judgments against them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Here he is coming up like clouds, / And his chariots like the whirlwind; / His horses are swifter than eagles. / Woe to us for we are devastated!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Wash your heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, / That you may be saved. / How long will your evil thoughts / Lodge within you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> For a voice declares from Dan / And announces affliction from the hill country of Ephraim.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Make mention to the nations; yes, / Announce against Jerusalem. / Besiegers are coming from a distant land / And utter their voice against the cities of Judah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Like those who watch over a field, they are against her all around / Because she has rebelled against Me, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Your way and your deeds / Have caused these things <I>to happen</I> to you. / This is your wickedness. Indeed it is bitter! / Indeed it reaches to your heart!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> My bowels, my bowels; I am writhing. / Oh, the walls of my heart! / My heart is moaning within me; / I cannot be silent; / For you hear, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, / The alarm of war.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:20">&nbsp;4:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed, / For the whole land is devastated. / Suddenly my tents are devastated, / <I>And</I> my curtains in a moment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:21">&nbsp;4:21 &nbsp;</A></B> How long will I see the standard, / <I>And</I> hear the sound of the trumpet?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:22">&nbsp;4:22 &nbsp;</A></B> For My people are foolish; / They do not know Me. / They are stupid children / And have no understanding. / They are wise to do evil, / But they do not know to do good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:23">&nbsp;4:23 &nbsp;</A></B> I looked at the earth, and there it was, waste and emptiness; / And at the heavens, and they had no light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:24">&nbsp;4:24 &nbsp;</A></B> I looked at the mountains, and there they were, shaking, / And all the hills were swaying.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:25">&nbsp;4:25 &nbsp;</A></B> I looked, and there was no man, / And all the birds of the heavens had fled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:26">&nbsp;4:26 &nbsp;</A></B> I looked, and there was the fruitful land, a wilderness, / And all its cities were torn down / Before Jehovah, before His burning anger.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:27">&nbsp;4:27 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / The whole land will be a desolation, / But I will not make a full end;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:28">&nbsp;4:28 &nbsp;</A></B> For this the earth will mourn, / And the heavens above will be dark; / Because I have spoken, I have purposed; / And I have not repented, nor will I turn from it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:29">&nbsp;4:29 &nbsp;</A></B> At the sound of horsemen and archers / Every city flees; / They go into the thickets / And climb up on the rocks. / Every city is forsaken, / And not even one inhabits them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:30">&nbsp;4:30 &nbsp;</A></B> And you, O desolate one, what will you do? / Although you dress in scarlet, / Although you are adorned with ornaments of gold,<BR>
Although you enlarge your eyes with paint, / In vain do you beautify yourself; / <I>Your</I> lovers despise you; / They seek your life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:31">&nbsp;4:31 &nbsp;</A></B> For I heard a cry like that of a woman in travail, / Anguish like that of a woman bringing forth her first child, / The sound of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath; / She stretches out her hands, <I>saying,</I> / Woe is me, / For my soul is fainting before murderers.<BR>
