</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The overseer then must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Not an excessive drinker; not a striker, but gentle; not contentious; not fond of money;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> One who manages well his own house, having <I>his</I> children in subjection with all gravity<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> (But if one does not know how to manage his own house, how will he care for the church of God?);<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment <I>suffered</I> by the devil.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And he also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Deacons <I>must</I> similarly <I>be</I> grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for base gain;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And these also must first be proved; then let them minister if they are unreprovable.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Women similarly <I>must be</I> grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing <I>their</I> children and their own houses well.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For those who have ministered well obtain for themselves a good standing and much boldness in faith, which is in Christ Jesus.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> But if I delay, <I>I write</I> that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness:<BR> 
He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.<BR>
