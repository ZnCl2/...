</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:1">23:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And the entire multitude of them rose up and led Him before Pilate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:2">23:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding <I>people</I> to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:3">23:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And Pilate asked Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And answering him, He said, <I>It is as</I> you say.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:4">23:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no fault in this man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:5">23:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But they were vehement, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:6">23:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And when Pilate heard <I>this,</I> he asked whether the man was a Galilean.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:7">23:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And when he realized that He was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him up to Herod, who also himself was in Jerusalem in those days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:8">23:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And when Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly, for he had wanted to see Him for a considerable time, because he had heard about Him, and was hoping to see some sign done by Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:9">23:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:10">23:10&nbsp;</A></B> And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:11">23:11&nbsp;</A></B> And Herod with his soldiers, having despised Him and mocked <I>Him,</I> threw around <I>Him</I> splendid clothing and sent Him back to Pilate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:12">23:12&nbsp;</A></B> And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that very day, for they had previously been at enmity toward each other.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:13">23:13&nbsp;</A></B> And Pilate, calling together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:14">23:14&nbsp;</A></B> Said to them, You have brought this man to me as one who turns the people away, and behold, I have examined <I>Him</I> before you and found no fault in this man regarding the accusations you bring against Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:15">23:15&nbsp;</A></B> No, neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:16">23:16&nbsp;</A></B> I will therefore discipline Him and release <I>Him</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:17">23:17&nbsp;</A></B> Now he was obliged to release to them one <I>prisoner</I> at the feast.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:18">23:18&nbsp;</A></B> But they cried out all together, saying, Take this man away and release to us Barabbas.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:19">23:19&nbsp;</A></B> He was one who, for a certain insurrection that occurred in the city and for murder, had been thrown into the prison.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:20">23:20&nbsp;</A></B> But Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:21">23:21&nbsp;</A></B> But they continued to shout, saying, Crucify, crucify Him!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:22">23:22&nbsp;</A></B> But he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in Him; I will therefore discipline Him and release <I>Him</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:23">23:23&nbsp;</A></B> But they pressed him with loud voices, asking that He be crucified, and their voices prevailed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:24">23:24&nbsp;</A></B> And Pilate gave sentence that their request be carried out,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:25">23:25&nbsp;</A></B> And he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:26">23:26&nbsp;</A></B> And as they led Him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the country, and they placed the cross upon him to carry <I>it</I> behind Jesus.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:27">23:27&nbsp;</A></B> And a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him followed Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:28">23:28&nbsp;</A></B> But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:29">23:29&nbsp;</A></B> For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts which have not nourished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:30">23:30&nbsp;</A></B> Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:31">23:31&nbsp;</A></B> For if they do these things with the tree full of sap, what will happen with the one that is dry?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:32">23:32&nbsp;</A></B> And two others also, <I>who were</I> criminals, were led with Him to be executed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:33">23:33&nbsp;</A></B> And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:34">23:34&nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they cast lots.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:35">23:35&nbsp;</A></B> And the people stood by, looking on. And the rulers also sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:36">23:36&nbsp;</A></B> And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to <I>Him</I> and offering Him vinegar,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:37">23:37&nbsp;</A></B> And saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:38">23:38&nbsp;</A></B> And there was also an inscription over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:39">23:39&nbsp;</A></B> And one of the criminals who were hanged <I>there</I> blasphemed Him, saying, Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:40">23:40&nbsp;</A></B> But the other, answering, rebuked him and said, Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:41">23:41&nbsp;</A></B> And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing amiss.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:42">23:42&nbsp;</A></B> And he said, Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:43">23:43&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:44">23:44&nbsp;</A></B> And it was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:45">23:45&nbsp;</A></B> The sun’s <I>light</I> failing; and the veil of the temple was split down the middle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:46">23:46&nbsp;</A></B> And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. And saying this, He expired.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:47">23:47&nbsp;</A></B> Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:48">23:48&nbsp;</A></B> And all the crowds who came together at this spectacle, when they beheld the things that happened, returned, beating their breasts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:49">23:49&nbsp;</A></B> And all those who knew Him, and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, observing these things.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:50">23:50&nbsp;</A></B> And behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and a good and righteous man<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:51">23:51&nbsp;</A></B> (This man had not consented to their counsel and action), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was expecting the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:52">23:52&nbsp;</A></B> This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:53">23:53&nbsp;</A></B> And he took <I>it</I> down and wrapped it in a fine linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever lain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:54">23:54&nbsp;</A></B> And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was coming on.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:55">23:55&nbsp;</A></B> And the women who had come together with Him out of Galilee followed after and beheld the tomb and how His body was laid.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:56">23:56&nbsp;</A></B> And they returned and prepared spices and ointment. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.<BR>
