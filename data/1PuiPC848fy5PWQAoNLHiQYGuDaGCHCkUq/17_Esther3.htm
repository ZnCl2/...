</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and he advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And all the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for so had the king commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate said to Mordecai, Why do you transgress the king’s command?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And when they had spoken to him day after day and he did not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down or pay homage to him, Haman was filled with rage.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him <I>who</I> the people of Mordecai <I>were;</I> therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the kingdom of Ahasuerus.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day and from month to month, <I>until it fell on</I> the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples throughout all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws differ from those of all the people, nor do they keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> If it please the king, let it be decreed in writing that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the <I>king’s</I> affairs, that they may bring <I>it</I> into the king’s treasuries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And the king said to Haman, The silver has been given to you, as well as the people, to do with them as it seems good to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the king’s scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day of <I>the month;</I> and it was decreed in writing, according to all that Haman commanded, to the king’s satraps and to the governors who were over each province and to the princes of every people, to each province in its own script and to each people in their own tongue; in the name of King Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the king’s signet ring.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And letters were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, children and women, in one day, that is, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder their spoil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> A copy of the written decree to be issued as law in all the provinces was published to all the peoples so that they would be ready for that day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> The couriers went out, driven in haste by the king’s command; and the decree was issued in Susa the capital. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in confusion.<BR>
