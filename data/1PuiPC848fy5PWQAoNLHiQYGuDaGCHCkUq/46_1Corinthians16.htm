</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:1">16:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now concerning the collection for the saints, just as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also do.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:2">16:2 &nbsp;</A></B> On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered, that no collections be made when I come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:3">16:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And when I arrive, whomever you approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:4">16:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And if it is fitting for me also to go, they will go with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:5">16:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I will pass through Macedonia.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:6">16:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, that you may send me forward wherever I may go.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:7">16:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For I do not wish to see you now <I>just</I> in passing, for I am hoping to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:8">16:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:9">16:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For a door is opened to me, great and efficacious, and there are many opposers.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:10">16:10&nbsp;</A></B> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; for he is working the work of the Lord, even as I am.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:11">16:11&nbsp;</A></B> Let no one therefore despise him, but send him forward in peace that he may come to me; for I am awaiting him with the brothers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:12">16:12&nbsp;</A></B> And concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all <I>his</I> desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:13">16:13&nbsp;</A></B> Watch, stand firm in the faith, be full-grown men, be strong.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:14">16:14&nbsp;</A></B> Let all your matters be done in love.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:15">16:15&nbsp;</A></B> Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:16">16:16&nbsp;</A></B> You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:17">16:17&nbsp;</A></B> Now I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these have filled up the lack caused by your absence;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:18">16:18&nbsp;</A></B> For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Acknowledge therefore such ones.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:19">16:19&nbsp;</A></B> The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church, which is in their house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:20">16:20&nbsp;</A></B> All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:21">16:21&nbsp;</A></B> The greeting in my own hand&nbsp;— Paul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:22">16:22&nbsp;</A></B> If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed! The Lord comes!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:23">16:23&nbsp;</A></B> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:24">16:24&nbsp;</A></B> My love in Christ Jesus be with you all.<BR>
