</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear this, O priests; / And listen, O house of Israel; / And, O house of the king, give ear. / For to you belongs the judgment, / For you have been a snare at Mizpah / And a net spread over Tabor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And the revolters have gone deep into slaughtering, / Though I am a chastisement to them all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I know Ephraim, / And Israel is not hidden from Me; / For now, Ephraim, you have gone about as a harlot; / Israel is defiled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Their doings do not permit them / To turn to their God; / For a spirit of harlotries is within them, / And they do not know Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And the pride of Israel testifies to his face, / And Ephraim and Israel will stumble in their iniquity; / Judah also will stumble with them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> With their flocks and with their herds they will go / To seek Jehovah, / But they will not find <I>Him;</I> / He has withdrawn Himself from them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> They have acted treacherously against Jehovah, / For they have begotten strange children. / Now the new moon will devour them / With their apportionments.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Blow the horn in Gibeah, / The trumpet in Ramah; / Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: / Behind you, O Benjamin!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim will be a desolation / In the day of correction; / Among the tribes of Israel / I have made known what is sure.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> The princes of Judah have become / Like those who move a boundary mark. / I will pour out upon them / My overflowing wrath like water.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim is oppressed, / Crushed by judgment, / For he was determined to walk / After <I>man’s</I> command.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim / And like rottenness to the house of Judah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> When Ephraim saw his sickness, / And Judah his wound, / Ephraim went to Assyria / And sent <I>word</I> to the warrior king; / But he cannot heal you, / And the wound will not depart from you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For I will be like a lion to Ephraim / And like a young lion to the house of Judah. / I, I will tear <I>them</I> and go away; / I will carry <I>them</I> off, and there will be no one to deliver <I>them.</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> I will go away, I will return to My place, / Until they acknowledge their offense / And seek My face; / In their affliction they will seek Me earnestly.<BR>
