</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:1">63:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Who is this who comes from Edom / With red-stained garments, from Bozrah? / This One who is majestic in His apparel, / Marching in the greatness of His strength? / It is I who speak in righteousness, / Mighty to save.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:2">63:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Why are you red in apparel, / And your garments like those of him who treads in the winepress?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:3">63:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I have trodden the wine trough alone, / And from the peoples there was no man with Me. / And I trod them in My anger / And trampled them in My wrath; / And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, / And I have stained all My apparel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:4">63:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For the day of recompense was in My heart, / And the year of My redemption had come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:5">63:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And I looked and there was no one to help; / And I was appalled that there was no one to uphold. / Therefore My own arm accomplished salvation for Me, / And My wrath, it upheld Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:6">63:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And I trod down the peoples in My anger / And made them drunk in My wrath, / And I poured out their lifeblood upon the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:7">63:7 &nbsp;</A></B> I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, / The praises of Jehovah, / According to all that Jehovah has bestowed on us / And the great goodness toward the house of Israel, / Which He has bestowed on them according to His compassions / And according to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:8">63:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For He said, Surely, they are My people, / Children who will not deal falsely; / So He became their Savior.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:9">63:9 &nbsp;</A></B> In all their affliction He was afflicted, / And the Angel of His presence saved them; / In His love and in His mercy / He redeemed them, / And He bore them up and carried them / All the days of old.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:10">63:10&nbsp;</A></B> But they rebelled and grieved / His Spirit of holiness; / Therefore He turned to become their enemy; / He fought against them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:11">63:11&nbsp;</A></B> Then He remembered the days of old, Moses <I>and</I> His people: / Where is He who brought them up out of the sea / With the shepherds of His flock? / Where is He who put in their midst / His Spirit of holiness;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:12">63:12&nbsp;</A></B> Who made His glorious arm / Go at the right hand of Moses; / Who divided the waters before them, / To make for Himself a name forever;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:13">63:13&nbsp;</A></B> Who led them through the depths, / Like a horse in the wilderness, / <I>And</I> they did not stumble?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:14">63:14&nbsp;</A></B> Like the cattle which go down into the valley, / The Spirit of Jehovah caused them to rest. / Thus did You lead Your people, / To make for Yourself a glorious name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:15">63:15&nbsp;</A></B> Look down from heaven, / And see from the habitation of Your holiness and Your beauty: / Where are Your zeal and Your mighty acts? / The stirring of Your inward parts / And Your compassions are restrained toward me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:16">63:16&nbsp;</A></B> For You are our Father, / Since Abraham does not know us, / And Israel does not acknowledge us. / You, Jehovah, are our Father; / Our Redeemer from eternity is Your name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:17">63:17&nbsp;</A></B> Why, O Jehovah, do You cause us to wander from Your ways / <I>And</I> harden our hearts so that we do not fear You? / Return for the sake of Your servants, / The tribes of Your inheritance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:18">63:18&nbsp;</A></B> Your holy people have possessed Your sanctuary for a little while; / Our adversaries have trodden <I>it</I> down.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="63:19">63:19&nbsp;</A></B> We have become <I>like</I> those over whom You have never ruled, / <I>Like</I> those who have not been called by Your name.<BR>
