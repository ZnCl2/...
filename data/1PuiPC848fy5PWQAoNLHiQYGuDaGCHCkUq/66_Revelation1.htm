</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire;<BR>
