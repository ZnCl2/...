</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? / And to which of the holy ones will you turn?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Surely vexation slays the fool, / And jealousy kills the simpleton.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I have seen the fool taking root, / But suddenly I cursed his habitation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> His children are far from safety, / And they are crushed in the gate; and there is no one to deliver <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The hungry eat his harvest / And even take <I>it</I> out from the thorns, / And the thirsty pant after his wealth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For evil does not come forth from the dust, / Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But man is born unto trouble, / Just as sparks fly upward.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But as for me, I would seek after God, / And I would commit my cause to God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Who does great things that cannot be searched, / Wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Who gives rain upon the surface of the earth / And sends water upon the surface of the fields;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Who sets on high those who are lowly / And puts those who mourn safely above <I>all.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> He frustrates the devices of the crafty, / So that their hands achieve no enterprise.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> He seizes the wise in their own craftiness, / And the counsel of the wily is brought to a sudden end.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> By day they encounter darkness, / And at noon they grope about as in the night.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth, / From the hand of the strong.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus the poor have hope, / And Injustice stops her mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:17">&nbsp;5:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, blessed is the man whom God corrects; / Therefore do not reject the chastening of the Almighty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:18">&nbsp;5:18 &nbsp;</A></B> For He wounds, but He binds up; / He strikes, but His hands heal.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:19">&nbsp;5:19 &nbsp;</A></B> In six troubles He will deliver you; / Indeed in seven no evil will touch you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:20">&nbsp;5:20 &nbsp;</A></B> In famine He will redeem you from death, / And in battle, from the power of the sword.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:21">&nbsp;5:21 &nbsp;</A></B> From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden, / And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:22">&nbsp;5:22 &nbsp;</A></B> At destruction and at famine you will laugh, / And you will not be afraid of the animals of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:23">&nbsp;5:23 &nbsp;</A></B> For you will be in an alliance with the stones of the field, / And the animals of the field will be at peace with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:24">&nbsp;5:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And you will know that your tent is at peace, / And you will inspect your fold and miss nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:25">&nbsp;5:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And you will know that your seed will be great, / And your offspring like the grass of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:26">&nbsp;5:26 &nbsp;</A></B> You will come to the grave at a ripe old age, / Like a shock of grain coming up in its season.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:27">&nbsp;5:27 &nbsp;</A></B> This is it. We have searched it out; it is so. / Hear then and know it for yourself.<BR>
