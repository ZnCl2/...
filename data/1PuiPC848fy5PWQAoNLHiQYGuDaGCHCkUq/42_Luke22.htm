</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:1">22:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was drawing near.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:2">22:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to do away with Him, for they feared the people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:3">22:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot and was of the number of the twelve.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:4">22:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers <I>as to</I> how he might deliver Him up to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:5">22:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And they rejoiced and promised to give him money.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:6">22:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And he consented and sought opportunity to deliver Him up to them apart from the crowd.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:7">22:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And the day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the passover had to be sacrificed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:8">22:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, so that we may eat <I>it</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:9">22:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And they said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare <I>it?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:10">22:10&nbsp;</A></B> And He told them, Behold, as you are entering into the city, a man carrying an earthen jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:11">22:11&nbsp;</A></B> And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the passover with My disciples?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:12">22:12&nbsp;</A></B> And that one will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:13">22:13&nbsp;</A></B> And they left and found <I>it</I> even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:14">22:14&nbsp;</A></B> And when the hour came, He reclined <I>at table,</I> and the apostles with Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:15">22:15&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:16">22:16&nbsp;</A></B> For I tell you that I shall by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:17">22:17&nbsp;</A></B> And He received a cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide <I>it</I> among yourselves;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:18">22:18&nbsp;</A></B> For I tell you, I shall by no means drink from now on of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:19">22:19&nbsp;</A></B> And He took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke <I>it</I> and gave <I>it</I> to them, saying, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:20">22:20&nbsp;</A></B> And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant <I>established</I> in My blood, which is being poured out for you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:21">22:21&nbsp;</A></B> But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me at the table.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:22">22:22&nbsp;</A></B> For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man through whom He is betrayed!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:23">22:23&nbsp;</A></B> And they began to discuss among themselves who then of them it was who was about to do this.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:24">22:24&nbsp;</A></B> And a contention also occurred among them as to which of them seemed to be greatest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:25">22:25&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:26">22:26&nbsp;</A></B> But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:27">22:27&nbsp;</A></B> For who is greater, the one who reclines <I>at table</I> or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines <I>at table?</I> But I am in your midst as the one who serves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:28">22:28&nbsp;</A></B> But you are those who have remained with Me throughout My trials.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:29">22:29&nbsp;</A></B> And I appoint to you, even as My Father has appointed to Me, a kingdom,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:30">22:30&nbsp;</A></B> That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:31">22:31&nbsp;</A></B> Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you <I>all</I> to sift <I>you</I> as wheat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:32">22:32&nbsp;</A></B> But I have made petition concerning you that your faith would not fail; and you, once you have turned again, establish your brothers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:33">22:33&nbsp;</A></B> And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:34">22:34&nbsp;</A></B> But He said, I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:35">22:35&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you? And they said, Nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:36">22:36&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, But now, let him who has a purse take <I>it,</I> likewise also a bag; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:37">22:37&nbsp;</A></B> For I tell you that this which is written must be accomplished in Me, “And He was counted with the lawless.” For indeed that which concerns Me has <I>its</I> fulfillment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:38">22:38&nbsp;</A></B> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:39">22:39&nbsp;</A></B> And He came out and went according to His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:40">22:40&nbsp;</A></B> And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:41">22:41&nbsp;</A></B> And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and prayed,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:42">22:42&nbsp;</A></B> Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet, not My will, but Yours be done.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:43">22:43&nbsp;</A></B> And an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:44">22:44&nbsp;</A></B> And being in agony He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:45">22:45&nbsp;</A></B> And when He rose up from prayer and came to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:46">22:46&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Why are you sleeping? Rise up and pray that you may not enter into temptation.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:47">22:47&nbsp;</A></B> While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd <I>came,</I> and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:48">22:48&nbsp;</A></B> But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:49">22:49&nbsp;</A></B> And those around Him, seeing what would happen, said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:50">22:50&nbsp;</A></B> And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:51">22:51&nbsp;</A></B> But Jesus answered and said, Let <I>them go</I> this far. And touching his ear, He healed him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:52">22:52&nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come up against Him, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:53">22:53&nbsp;</A></B> While I was with you day by day in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:54">22:54&nbsp;</A></B> And having arrested Him, they led <I>Him away,</I> and brought <I>Him</I> into the house of the high priest.<BR>

But Peter followed at a distance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:55">22:55&nbsp;</A></B> And when they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:56">22:56&nbsp;</A></B> And a certain servant girl, seeing him seated in the light <I>of the fire,</I> looked intently at him and said, This man was with Him too.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:57">22:57&nbsp;</A></B> But he denied <I>it,</I> saying, I do not know Him, woman.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:58">22:58&nbsp;</A></B> And after a short time, another person, seeing him, said, You also are one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:59">22:59&nbsp;</A></B> And after about one hour had passed, another one insisted, saying, Surely this man was also with Him, for he is also a Galilean.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:60">22:60&nbsp;</A></B> But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:61">22:61&nbsp;</A></B> And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:62">22:62&nbsp;</A></B> And he went outside and wept bitterly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:63">22:63&nbsp;</A></B> And the men who were holding Him mocked Him and beat <I>Him</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:64">22:64&nbsp;</A></B> And they blindfolded Him and questioned <I>Him,</I> saying, Prophesy! Who is the one who hit You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:65">22:65&nbsp;</A></B> And they said many other things against Him, blaspheming.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:66">22:66&nbsp;</A></B> And when it became day, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and they led Him away to their Sanhedrin, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:67">22:67&nbsp;</A></B> If You are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you shall by no means believe;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:68">22:68&nbsp;</A></B> And if I ask <I>you,</I> you shall by no means answer.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:69">22:69&nbsp;</A></B> But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:70">22:70&nbsp;</A></B> And they all said, Are You then the Son of God? And He said to them, You say <I>rightly</I> that I am.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:71">22:71&nbsp;</A></B> And they said, What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard <I>it</I> ourselves from His mouth.<BR>
