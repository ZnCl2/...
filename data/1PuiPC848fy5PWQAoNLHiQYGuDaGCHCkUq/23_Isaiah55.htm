</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:1">55:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, / And you who have no money; / Come, buy and eat; / Yes, come, buy wine and milk / Without money and without price.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:2">55:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Why do you spend money for what is not bread, / And the result of your labor for what does not satisfy? / Hear Me attentively, and eat what is good, / And let your soul delight itself in fatness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:3">55:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Incline your ear and come to Me; / Hear, so that your soul may live; / And I will make an eternal covenant with you, / Even the sure mercies <I>shown</I> to David.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:4">55:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I have given Him as a Witness to the peoples, / A Leader and a Commander to the peoples.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:5">55:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, you will call a nation that you do not know, / And a nation that does not know you will run to you, / Because of Jehovah your God, even the Holy One of Israel, / For He has glorified you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:6">55:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Seek Jehovah while He may be found; / Call upon Him while He is near.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:7">55:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Let the wicked forsake his way, / And the evildoer, his thoughts; / And let him return to Jehovah, and He will have compassion on him; / And to our God, for He will pardon abundantly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:8">55:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For My thoughts are not your thoughts, / And your ways are not My ways, declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:9">55:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For <I>as</I> the heavens are higher than the earth, / So My ways are higher than your ways, / And My thoughts <I>higher</I> than your thoughts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:10">55:10&nbsp;</A></B> For just as the rain comes down / And the snow from heaven, / And does not return there, / Until it waters the earth / And makes it bear and sprout forth, / That it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:11">55:11&nbsp;</A></B> So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; / It will not return to Me vainly, / But it will accomplish what I delight in, / And it will prosper in the matter to which I have sent it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:12">55:12&nbsp;</A></B> For you will go out with rejoicing, / And you will be led forth in peace; / The mountains and the hills / Will break forth before you with a ringing shout, / And all the trees of the field will clap <I>their</I> hands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:13">55:13&nbsp;</A></B> In place of the thornbush, the fir tree will come up; / In place of the brier, the myrtle will come up; / And it will be to Jehovah as a name, / As an eternal sign that will not be cut off.<BR>
