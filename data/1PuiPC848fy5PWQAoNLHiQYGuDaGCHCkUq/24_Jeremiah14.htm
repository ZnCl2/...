</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:1">14:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:2">14:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Judah mourns, / And her gates languish; / In black they mourn on the ground, / And the cry of Jerusalem goes up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:3">14:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And their nobles send their servants for water; / They come to cisterns, / And they find no water; / They return with their vessels empty; / They are ashamed and confounded / And cover their heads.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:4">14:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Because the ground is cracked, / For there has been no rain on the earth, / The farmers are ashamed; / They cover their heads.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:5">14:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For even the hind in the field gives birth and abandons <I>its young</I> / Because there is no grass.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:6">14:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And the wild asses stand on the bare heights; / They pant after the wind like jackals; / Their eyes fail, / For there is no herbage.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:7">14:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Although our iniquities testify against us, / O Jehovah, act for Your name’s sake, / For our apostasies have become many; / We have sinned against You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:8">14:8 &nbsp;</A></B> O Hope of Israel, / Its Savior in a time of distress, / Why should You be like a sojourner in the land, / Like a traveler who turns aside to lodge for the night?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:9">14:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Why should You be like an astonished man, / Like a mighty man who is unable to save? / Yet You are in our midst, O Jehovah, / And we are called by Your name; / Do not leave us.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:10">14:10&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah to this people, Even so they have loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet. Therefore Jehovah has no delight in them; now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:11">14:11&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to me, Do not pray for the welfare of this people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:12">14:12&nbsp;</A></B> When they fast, I will not listen to their cry; when they offer up a burnt offering and a meal offering, I will not accept them; but by sword and by famine and by pestilence I will consume them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:13">14:13&nbsp;</A></B> And I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Indeed, the prophets say to them, You will not see sword, nor will you have famine, for I will give you assured peace in this place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:14">14:14&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to me, The prophets prophesy falsehood in My name; I did not send them or command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a false vision and divination and a worthless thing and the deceit of their own heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:15">14:15&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, although I did not send them, yet they say, A sword and famine will not be in this land: By sword and by famine those prophets will be consumed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:16">14:16&nbsp;</A></B> And the people to whom they prophesy will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them&nbsp;— them, their wives, and their sons and their daughters&nbsp;— and I will pour out their <I>own</I> wickedness on them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:17">14:17&nbsp;</A></B> And you shall speak this word to them, / Let my eyes run down with tears / Night and day, and let them not cease; / For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with great brokenness, / A very grievous wound.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:18">14:18&nbsp;</A></B> If I go forth into the field&nbsp;— / Look, those slain by the sword; / And if I come into the city&nbsp;— / Look, those diseased with famine. / For both the prophet and the priest / Will go about in a land that they do not know.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:19">14:19&nbsp;</A></B> Have You utterly rejected Judah? / Or does Your soul loathe Zion? / Why have You stricken us / So that there is no healing for us? / <I>We</I> looked for peace, but no good <I>came;</I> / And for a time of healing, but there was terror.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:20">14:20&nbsp;</A></B> We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, / The iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:21">14:21&nbsp;</A></B> Do not hold <I>us</I> in contempt, for Your name’s sake; / Do not dishonor Your throne of glory; / Remember <I>and</I> do not break Your covenant with us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:22">14:22&nbsp;</A></B> Are there among the vanities of the nations any that can bring rain, / Or <I>in</I> the heavens any that can give showers? / Are You not He, O Jehovah our God? / Therefore we wait for You, / For You have made all these things.<BR>
