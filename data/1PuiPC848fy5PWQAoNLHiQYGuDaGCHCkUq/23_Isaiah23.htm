</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:1">23:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden concerning Tyre: / Howl, O ships of Tarshish, / For it is destroyed&nbsp;— lacking house, / Lacking entrance. From <I>as far away as</I> the land of Kittim / It is told to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:2">23:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Hush, you inhabitants of the coastland, / You, whom the merchants of Sidon, / Who cross the sea, have replenished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:3">23:3 &nbsp;</A></B>  And by <I>way of</I> many waters / The grain of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue; / And she was profit to the nations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:4">23:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Be ashamed, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, / The stronghold of the sea, saying, / I have not been in labor nor given birth; / Neither have I brought up young men, / <I>Nor</I> have I raised virgins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:5">23:5 &nbsp;</A></B> When the report <I>reaches</I> Egypt, / They will writhe in pain at the report concerning Tyre.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:6">23:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Cross over to Tarshish; / Howl, you inhabitants of the coastland.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:7">23:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Is this your jubilant <I>city,</I> / Whose antiquity is from the days of antiquity, / Whose feet carried her off afar to sojourn?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:8">23:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Who has purposed this / Against Tyre, the giver of crowns, / Whose merchants were princes, / Whose traders were the honorable of the earth?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:9">23:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah of hosts has purposed it, / To defile the pride of all beauty, / To bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:10">23:10&nbsp;</A></B> Overflow your land like a river, O daughter of Tarshish; / There is no more restraint.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:11">23:11&nbsp;</A></B> He has stretched out His hand over the sea; / He has shaken kingdoms. / Jehovah has given commandment concerning Canaan / To destroy its strongholds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:12">23:12&nbsp;</A></B> And He has said, You shall not continue to exult any longer, / O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. / Arise; cross over to Kittim&nbsp;— / There also you will have no rest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:13">23:13&nbsp;</A></B> See the land of the Chaldeans, this people! They were not&nbsp;— the Assyrians assigned it to desert animals; they raised their siege towers; they stripped their citadels; they brought it to ruin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:14">23:14&nbsp;</A></B> Howl, O ships of Tarshish, / For your stronghold is destroyed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:15">23:15&nbsp;</A></B> In that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of the seventy years Tyre will be like <I>her in</I> the harlot’s song:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:16">23:16&nbsp;</A></B> Take a harp; / Compass the city, / Forgotten harlot. / Play well; / Abound in song, / That you may be remembered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:17">23:17&nbsp;</A></B> And at the end of the seventy years Jehovah will visit Tyre. And she will return to the wages of her harlotry and will be a harlot to all the kingdoms of the earth on land’s surface.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:18">23:18&nbsp;</A></B> And her profit and the wages of her harlotry will be dedicated to Jehovah; it will not be stored up, nor will it be hoarded, for her profit will be for those who dwell before Jehovah, as <I>their</I> sufficient food and <I>their</I> choice clothing.<BR>
