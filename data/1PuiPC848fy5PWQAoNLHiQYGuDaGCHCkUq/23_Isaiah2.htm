</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But in the last days / The mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established / On the top of the mountains; / And it will be lifted up above the hills; / And all the nations will stream to it,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B>  And many peoples will come and say, / Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, / To the house of the God of Jacob, / That He may instruct us in His ways, / And that we may walk in His paths. / For from Zion will go forth instruction, / And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And He will judge between the nations, / And will decide <I>matters</I> for many peoples. / And they will beat their swords into plowshares, / And their spears into pruning knives; / Nation will not lift up sword against nation, / Nor will they learn war anymore.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> House of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For You have abandoned Your people, / The house of Jacob; / Because they are full of <I>customs from</I> the east, / And they are soothsayers like the Philistines, / And they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Their land is full of silver and gold, / And their treasures are limitless; / Their land is also full of horses, / And their chariots are limitless.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And their land is full of idols; / They bow down to the work of their hands, / To that which their fingers have made.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased&nbsp;— / But do not forgive them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Enter into the rock, / And hide in the dust, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Man’s haughty look will be abased, / And the loftiness of men will be humbled; / But Jehovah alone will be exalted / In that day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah of hosts will have a day / Over everything proud and lofty, / And over everything lifted up that it may be abased;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Over all the cedars of Lebanon, / Which are lofty and lifted up, / And over all the oaks of Bashan;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Over all the lofty mountains, / And over all the hills that are lifted up;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Over every high tower, / And over every fortified wall;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Over all the ships of Tarshish, / And over all their pleasant artifacts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And the haughtiness of the ordinary man will be humbled, / And the loftiness of the men of distinction will be abased; / But Jehovah alone will be exalted / In that day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:18">&nbsp;2:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And the idols will vanish completely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:19">&nbsp;2:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And <I>men</I> will go into caves in the rocks / And into holes in the dust, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty, / When He arises to make the earth tremble.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:20">&nbsp;2:20 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day a man will cast / His idols of silver and his idols of gold, / Which they made for themselves to bow down to, / To the moles and to the bats,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:21">&nbsp;2:21 &nbsp;</A></B> So that they may go into the crevices of the rocks / And into the clefts of the cliffs, / From the dread of Jehovah, / And from the splendor of His majesty, / When He arises to make the earth tremble.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:22">&nbsp;2:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Stop regarding man, / Whose <I>life</I> breath is in his nostrils. / For of what <I>value</I> is he considered to be?<BR>
