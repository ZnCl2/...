</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> My son, if you have become a surety for your neighbor, / If you have given your hands as a pledge for a stranger,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> You are snared by the words of your mouth; / You are caught by the words of your mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, / Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor: / Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not give sleep to your eyes, / Nor slumber to your eyelids.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the <I>hunter’s</I> hand / And like a bird from the fowler’s hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Go to the ant, you sluggard; / Consider its ways, and be wise,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Which, having no chief, / Officer, or ruler,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Prepares its food in summer / <I>And</I> gathers its sustenance in the harvest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> How long, sluggard, will you lie <I>there?</I> / When will you arise from your sleep?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> A little sleep, a little slumber, / A little folding of the hands to rest,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And your poverty will come <I>upon you</I> like a robber, / And your want, like an armed man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> A worthless man, a wicked man, / Goes around with a perverse mouth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Winking with his eyes, signaling with his feet, / Pointing with his fingers;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> With perverseness in his heart, he is devising evil continually; / He injects discord.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; / In a moment he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:16">&nbsp;6:16 &nbsp;</A></B> There are six things that Jehovah hates; / Indeed, seven that are an abomination to His soul:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:17">&nbsp;6:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, / And hands that shed innocent blood,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:18">&nbsp;6:18 &nbsp;</A></B> A heart that devises wicked schemes, / Feet that hurry to run to evil,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:19">&nbsp;6:19 &nbsp;</A></B> A false witness who utters lies, / And one who injects discord among brothers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:20">&nbsp;6:20 &nbsp;</A></B> My son, keep the commandment of your father, / And do not reject the teaching of your mother;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:21">&nbsp;6:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Bind them continually on your heart; / Tie them around your neck.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:22">&nbsp;6:22 &nbsp;</A></B> When you walk about, it will guide you, / When you lie down, it will watch over you; / And when you awake, it will talk with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:23">&nbsp;6:23 &nbsp;</A></B> For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, / And the reproofs of instruction are the way of life,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:24">&nbsp;6:24 &nbsp;</A></B> To keep you from the evil woman, / From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:25">&nbsp;6:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not desire her beauty in your heart, / Nor let her catch you with her eyelids;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:26">&nbsp;6:26 &nbsp;</A></B> For the price of a harlot is <I>a loaf of</I> bread, / But the wife of <I>another</I> man hunts for the precious soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:27">&nbsp;6:27 &nbsp;</A></B> Can a man take fire in his bosom / And his clothes not be burned?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:28">&nbsp;6:28 &nbsp;</A></B> Can a man walk on hot coals / And his feet not be scorched?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:29">&nbsp;6:29 &nbsp;</A></B> So <I>it is with</I> him who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; / No one who touches her will be unpunished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:30">&nbsp;6:30 &nbsp;</A></B> The thief is not despised if he steals / To satisfy himself when he is hungry;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:31">&nbsp;6:31 &nbsp;</A></B> But if he is found out, he shall restore sevenfold; / He must give over all the substance of his house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:32">&nbsp;6:32 &nbsp;</A></B> He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; / He who does it destroys his own soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:33">&nbsp;6:33 &nbsp;</A></B> He will find wounds and dishonor, / And his reproach will not be wiped away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:34">&nbsp;6:34 &nbsp;</A></B> For jealousy is the rage of a man, / And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:35">&nbsp;6:35 &nbsp;</A></B> He will not regard any ransom, / Nor will he be content if you give <I>him</I> great gifts.<BR>
