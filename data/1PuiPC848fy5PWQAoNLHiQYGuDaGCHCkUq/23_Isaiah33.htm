</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:1">33:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to you who destroy and were not destroyed, / And to him who deals unfaithfully and was not dealt with unfaithfully! / When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed; / And when you cease to deal unfaithfully, they will deal unfaithfully with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:2">33:2 &nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, be gracious to us; we have waited for You; / Be our arm every morning, / Our salvation also in the time of distress.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:3">33:3 &nbsp;</A></B> At the noise of the tumult the peoples flee; / At the lifting up of Yourself the nations were scattered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:4">33:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And your spoil will be gathered <I>as</I> the caterpillar gathers; / As locusts rush to and fro, <I>men</I> will rush to and fro upon it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:5">33:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah is exalted, for He dwells on high; / He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:6">33:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And there will be stability for your times: / A wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge; / The fear of Jehovah is his treasure.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:7">33:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed their heroes cry in the streets; / The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:8">33:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The highways are desolate; / The traveler ceases <I>to travel.</I> / He has broken the covenant; he despises the cities; / He does not regard man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:9">33:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The land mourns <I>and</I> languishes; / Lebanon is ashamed <I>and</I> withers away; / Sharon is like a desert, / And Bashan and Carmel shake off <I>their leaves.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:10">33:10&nbsp;</A></B> Now I will arise, says Jehovah, / Now I will be exalted; now I will be lifted up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:11">33:11&nbsp;</A></B> You will conceive chaff; you will give birth to stubble; / Your own breath, like fire, will devour you;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:12">33:12&nbsp;</A></B> And the peoples will be like the burning of lime, / Like cut down thorns that are burned in the fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:13">33:13&nbsp;</A></B> Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; / And know, you who are near, My might.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:14">33:14&nbsp;</A></B> The sinners in Zion are terrified; / Trembling has seized the profane: / Who among us can dwell with consuming fire? / Who among us can dwell with everlasting burning?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:15">33:15&nbsp;</A></B> He who walks in righteousness and speaks uprightness; / He who rejects gains seized by extortion; / He who shakes his hands lest they hold on to a bribe, / Who stops his ears so as not to hear of bloodshed / And shuts his eyes so as not to look at evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:16">33:16&nbsp;</A></B> This one will dwell on the heights; / His lofty retreat will be the rocky strongholds; / His bread will be given <I>to him;</I> his water will be sure.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:17">33:17&nbsp;</A></B> Your eyes will see the King in His beauty; / They will behold a land that is very far away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:18">33:18&nbsp;</A></B> Your heart will meditate on terror: / Where is he who counts? Where is he who weighs? / Where is he who counts the towers?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:19">33:19&nbsp;</A></B> You will not see a fierce people, / A people of unintelligible speech, hardly audible, / Of a stammering tongue which cannot be understood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:20">33:20&nbsp;</A></B> Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts; / Your eyes will see Jerusalem, / A secure habitation, a tent that will not be removed; / Its stakes will never be pulled up, / And none of its cords will be torn apart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:21">33:21&nbsp;</A></B> But there the Majestic, Jehovah, will be for us / A place of rivers <I>and</I> broad streams, / On which no boat with oars will go / And no majestic ship will pass.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:22">33:22&nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah is our Judge, / Jehovah is our Lawmaker, / Jehovah is our King; He will save us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:23">33:23&nbsp;</A></B> Your tackle has been slackened; / It does not support its mast firmly, / Nor does it spread out the sail. / Then the prey of abundant spoil is divided; / The lame take the plunder.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="33:24">33:24&nbsp;</A></B> And the inhabitant will not say, I am sick; / The people who dwell there will be forgiven <I>their</I> iniquity.<BR>
