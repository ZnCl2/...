</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:1">28:1 &nbsp;</A></B> There is certainly a mine for silver, / And a place for gold to be refined.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:2">28:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Iron is taken out of the earth, / And copper is smelted from rock.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:3">28:3 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>The miner</I> sets an end to the darkness, / And to the very end he searches out / The stones of deep darkness and of gloom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:4">28:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He breaks open a shaft apart from where <I>men</I> dwell; / They are forgotten by the foot; / They are suspended apart from men, they sway about.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:5">28:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The earth&nbsp;— from it comes forth food, / Yet underneath it, it is turned up as it were by fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:6">28:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Its stones are the place of sapphires, / And <I>its</I> dust has gold.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:7">28:7 &nbsp;</A></B> It is a path known by no bird of prey, / And the falcon’s eye has not seen it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:8">28:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The proud beasts have not trodden it; / The fierce lion does not pass along it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:9">28:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The miner sends forth his hand into the flinty rock; / He overturns the mountains by <I>its</I> roots.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:10">28:10&nbsp;</A></B> He cuts out channels in the rocks, / And his eye sees every precious thing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:11">28:11&nbsp;</A></B> He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, / And that which is hidden he brings out to the light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:12">28:12&nbsp;</A></B> But where shall wisdom be found? / And where is the place of understanding?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:13">28:13&nbsp;</A></B> Man does not know its price, / Nor is it found in the land of the living.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:14">28:14&nbsp;</A></B> The deep says, It is not in me; / And the sea says, It is not with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:15">28:15&nbsp;</A></B> Rare gold cannot be given for it, / Nor can silver be weighed out for its price.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:16">28:16&nbsp;</A></B> It cannot be balanced with the gold of Ophir, / With precious onyx or <I>with</I> sapphire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:17">28:17&nbsp;</A></B> Gold and glass cannot compare with it, / Nor can vessels of fine gold be exchanged for it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:18">28:18&nbsp;</A></B> Coral and crystal cannot be mentioned <I>with it;</I> / Indeed the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:19">28:19&nbsp;</A></B> The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it, / Nor can it be balanced with pure gold.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:20">28:20&nbsp;</A></B> From where then does wisdom come? / And where is the place of understanding?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:21">28:21&nbsp;</A></B> For it is hidden from the eyes of all living / And concealed from the birds of heaven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:22">28:22&nbsp;</A></B> Abaddon and Death say, / We have heard a report of it with our ears.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:23">28:23&nbsp;</A></B> God understands the way to it; / He knows its place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:24">28:24&nbsp;</A></B> For He sees to the ends of the earth; / He beholds all that is under heaven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:25">28:25&nbsp;</A></B> When He gave weight to the wind / And apportioned the water by measure,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:26">28:26&nbsp;</A></B> When He made a decree for the rain / And a way for the thunderbolt;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:27">28:27&nbsp;</A></B> Then He saw it and declared it; / He established it and even searched it out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:28">28:28&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to man, / Indeed, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; / And to depart from evil is understanding.<BR>
