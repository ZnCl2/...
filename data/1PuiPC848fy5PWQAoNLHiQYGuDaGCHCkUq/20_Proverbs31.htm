</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:14">31:14&nbsp;</A></B> She is like the merchant ships; / She brings her food from afar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:15">31:15&nbsp;</A></B> She rises also while it is still night / And gives food to her household, / And <I>their</I> task to her <I>serving</I> girls.<BR>
