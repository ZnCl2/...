</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, the king in Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; / Vanity of vanities; all is vanity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> What advantage does a man have in all his work / Which he does under the sun?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> A generation goes and a generation comes, / But the earth stands forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Also, the sun rises, and the sun sets / And hurries to its place where it rises.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Going to the south, then turning to the north, / Turning about continually, the wind goes on; / And <I>following</I> its circuits, the wind returns.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> All the rivers run to the sea, / Yet the sea is not full; / To the place where the rivers run, / There they run again.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> All things are wearisome; / No one is able to tell <I>it;</I> / The eye is not satisfied with seeing, / Nor is the ear filled with hearing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> What has been is what will be, / And what has been done is what will be done, / And there is nothing new under the sun.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Is there anything of which one can say, See, this is new? / Already it has been, in the ages that were before us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> There is no remembrance of those who were before; / And also those who will come to be afterward, for them there will be no / remembrance / With those who come to be after <I>them.</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And I set my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. It is grievous travail that God has given to the children of men to travail in.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and indeed, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> I spoke to my own heart, saying, Now I have magnified and increased <I>my</I> wisdom more than all who have been over Jerusalem before me; and my heart has observed in abundance wisdom and knowledge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I perceived that this also is a chasing after wind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:18">&nbsp;1:18 &nbsp;</A></B> For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.<BR>
