</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore you are without excuse, O every man who judges, for in what you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And do you consider this, O man, who judge those who practice such things and do the same <I>yourself,</I> that you will escape the judgment of God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Or do you despise the riches of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that God’s kindness is leading you to repentance?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But, according to your hardness and <I>your</I> unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Who will render to each according to his works:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> To those who by endurance in good work seek glory and honor and incorruptibility, life eternal;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But to those who are selfishly contentious and disobedient to the truth and obey unrighteousness, wrath and fury.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who commits evil, both of Jew first and of Greek;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> But glory and honor and peace to everyone who works good, both to Jew first and to Greek.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For there is no respect of persons with God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> (For <I>it is</I> not the hearers of the law <I>who</I> are righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For when Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have no law, are a law to themselves,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness with <I>it</I> and their reasonings, one with the other, accusing or even excusing <I>them.</I>)<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> In the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> But if you bear the name of Jew, and rest upon the law, and boast in God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:18">&nbsp;2:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And know the will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:19">&nbsp;2:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And have confidence that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:20">&nbsp;2:20 &nbsp;</A></B> One who disciplines the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the proper form of the knowledge and truth in the law;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:21">&nbsp;2:21 &nbsp;</A></B> You therefore who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:22">&nbsp;2:22 &nbsp;</A></B> You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob <I>their</I> temples?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:23">&nbsp;2:23 &nbsp;</A></B> You who boast in the law, do you by transgression of the law dishonor God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:24">&nbsp;2:24 &nbsp;</A></B> For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” even as it is written.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:25">&nbsp;2:25 &nbsp;</A></B> For circumcision profits if you practice the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:26">&nbsp;2:26 &nbsp;</A></B> If therefore the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:27">&nbsp;2:27 &nbsp;</A></B> And the uncircumcision by nature, if he fulfills the law, will judge you who through the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:28">&nbsp;2:28 &nbsp;</A></B> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:29">&nbsp;2:29 &nbsp;</A></B> But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter, whose praise is not from men, but from God.<BR>
