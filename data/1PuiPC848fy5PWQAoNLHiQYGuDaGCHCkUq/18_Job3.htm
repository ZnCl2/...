</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his <I>birth.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Job responded and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Let the day on which I was born perish, / And the night which said, A man has been conceived.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Let that day be darkness; / Let God not seek it from above, / Nor let light shine upon it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Let darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it; / Let a cloud dwell upon it; / Let the things that blacken the day terrify it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> As for that night, let deep darkness take hold of it; / Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; / Let it not come up in the number of the months.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Behold, let that night be barren; / Let no joyous shout come in it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Let those curse it who curse the day, / Who are ready to rouse leviathan.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Let its predawn stars be dark; / Let it wait for light and there be none, / And do not let it see the eyelids of the dawn.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For it did not shut up the doors of the womb <I>that bore</I> me, / Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Why did I not die at birth, / Come forth from the womb and expire?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Why did the knees receive me? / And why the breasts, that I should suck?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For now I would have lain down and been undisturbed; / I would have slept; then I would have been at rest<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> With kings and counselors of the earth, / Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Or with princes who had gold, / Who filled their houses with silver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Or like a miscarriage that has been concealed, I would not have been, / Like infants that do not see the light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> There the wicked cease from <I>their</I> troubling, / And there the weary rest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Captives are altogether at ease; / They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> The small and the great are there, / And the servant is free from his master.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:20">&nbsp;3:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Why does He give light to him who suffers / And life to the bitter in soul,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:21">&nbsp;3:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Who wait for death, but it is not there; / And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:22">&nbsp;3:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Who rejoice to the point of exultation / And are glad when they have found the grave;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:23">&nbsp;3:23 &nbsp;</A></B> To the man whose way is hidden / And whom God has hedged in?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:24">&nbsp;3:24 &nbsp;</A></B> For my sighing comes as my food, / And my groaning pours out like water.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:25">&nbsp;3:25 &nbsp;</A></B> For I dread something, and it comes upon me; / And what I fear comes to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:26">&nbsp;3:26 &nbsp;</A></B> I have no ease and I have no quiet / And I have no rest, but trouble comes.<BR>
