</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:57">28:57&nbsp;</A></B> The child who comes forth from her and her children whom she will bear; for she will eat them secretly for lack of all things in the siege and distress with which your enemy will distress you in your towns.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:58">28:58&nbsp;</A></B> If you are not certain to do all the words of this law written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name&nbsp;— Jehovah your God&nbsp;— <BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:62">28:62&nbsp;</A></B> And you will be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven in multitude; for you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:63">28:63&nbsp;</A></B> And as Jehovah exulted over you to do you good and to multiply you, so will Jehovah exult over you to make you perish and to destroy you; and you will be torn off the land which you are entering to possess.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:64">28:64&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will scatter you among all the peoples, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you will serve other gods whom you and your fathers have not known, <I>mere</I> wood and stone.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:65">28:65&nbsp;</A></B> And among those nations you will have no rest, nor will there be a resting place for the sole of your foot; but Jehovah will give you there a quivering heart and eyes failing <I>with longing</I> and a languishing soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:66">28:66&nbsp;</A></B> And your life will be hung in suspense before you, and you will dread night and day; and you will have no assurance of your life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:67">28:67&nbsp;</A></B> In the morning you will say, Oh that it were evening! and in the evening you will say, Oh that it were morning! because of your heart’s dread with which you will dread and because of the sight <I>before</I> your eyes which you will see.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:68">28:68&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by the way concerning which I said to you, You shall never again see it. And there you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies, as male slaves and as female slaves, but no one will buy <I>you.</I><BR>
