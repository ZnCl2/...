</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Seek refuge, O children of Benjamin, / From the midst of Jerusalem; / And blow the trumpet in Tekoa / And raise up a signal on Beth-haccerem; / For evil looks down from the north, / And great destruction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The comely and delicate one, / The daughter of Zion, I will cut off.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Shepherds will come to her / With their flocks; / They will pitch tents against her all around; / They will feed each one in his place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Prepare war against her; / Rise up, and let us go up at noon. / Woe to us, for the day has declined, / For the shadows of evening are lengthening.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Rise up, and let us go up at night / And destroy her palaces.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah of hosts, / Cut down her trees and build up / A mound against Jerusalem. / This is the city to be punished; / In her midst there is only oppression.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> As a cistern keeps its waters fresh, / So she has kept her wickedness fresh. / Violence and destruction are heard in her; / Sickness and wounds are always before Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Be admonished, O Jerusalem, / Lest My desire for you depart, / Lest I make you a desolation, / An uninhabited land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, / They will thoroughly glean like a vine / The remnant of Israel; / Pass your hand again over the branches / Like a grape gatherer.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> To whom shall I speak and testify, / That they may hear? / Indeed, their ear is uncircumcised, / And they are unable to listen. / See, the word of Jehovah has become a reproach to them; / They have no delight in it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; / I am weary of holding <I>it</I> in. / Pour <I>it</I> out upon the children in the street / And upon the assembly of the young men together; / For even the husband with the wife will be taken; / The old man, with the one who is full of days.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And their houses will be turned over to others, / Fields and wives together; / For I will stretch out My hand / Over the inhabitants of the land, / Declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For from the least of them to the greatest of them, / Everyone is wresting unjust gain; / And from the prophet to the priest, / Everyone is dealing falsely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And they have healed / The brokenness of My people slightly, / Saying, Peace, peace; / Although there is no peace.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? / They were not at all ashamed; / They did not even know to blush. / Therefore they will fall with those who fall; / At the time I punish them, they will stumble, / Says Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:16">&nbsp;6:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / Stand by the ways and see, / And ask for the ancient paths; / <I>Ask</I> where the good way is, and walk in it; / And you will find rest for your souls. / But they said, We will not walk <I>in it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:17">&nbsp;6:17 &nbsp;</A></B> So I set watchmen over you, <I>saying,</I> / Listen to the sound of the trumpet. / But they said, We will not listen.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:18">&nbsp;6:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore hear, O nations, / And understand, O assembly, / What <I>I will do</I> to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:19">&nbsp;6:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen, O earth; I am now bringing evil / On this people, / The fruit of their thoughts; / Because they have not listened to My words, / And they have also rejected My law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:20">&nbsp;6:20 &nbsp;</A></B> For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba, / And sweet cane from a distant land? / Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, / And your sacrifices are not pleasing to Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:21">&nbsp;6:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah, / I am now laying before this people stumbling blocks, / And fathers and sons together / Will stumble against them; / A neighbor and his friend will perish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:22">&nbsp;6:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / See, a people is coming from the land of the north, / And a great nation is stirring from the uttermost parts of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:23">&nbsp;6:23 &nbsp;</A></B> They grasp bow and spear; / They are cruel and have no mercy; / Their voice roars like the sea; / And they ride upon horses, / Set in array as a man for battle / Against you, O daughter of Zion.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:24">&nbsp;6:24 &nbsp;</A></B> We have heard its report; / Our hands are feeble; / Distress has seized us, / Pain like a woman in childbirth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:25">&nbsp;6:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not go out into the field, / And do not walk on the road; / For the enemy has a sword; / Terror is on every side.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:26">&nbsp;6:26 &nbsp;</A></B> O daughter of my people, gird yourself in sackcloth / And roll in ashes; / Mourn <I>as</I> for an only son, / A most bitter wailing; / For suddenly the destroyer / Will come upon us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:27">&nbsp;6:27 &nbsp;</A></B> I have set you as a trier among My people, as a fortress, / That you may know and try their way.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:28">&nbsp;6:28 &nbsp;</A></B> All of them are most rebellious, / Going about as slanderers; / They are bronze and iron; / All of them act corruptly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:29">&nbsp;6:29 &nbsp;</A></B> The bellows are burned; / The lead is consumed by the fire; / The refining continues in vain, / For the wicked are not removed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:30">&nbsp;6:30 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Men</I> will call them rejected silver, / Because Jehovah has rejected them.<BR>
