</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:1">10:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And after this the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:2">10:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent <I>word</I> through his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:3">10:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Do you really think that David is honoring your father just because he sent some men to you to comfort <I>you?</I> Has not David sent his servants to you in order to search out the city and to spy on it and to overthrow it?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:4">10:4 &nbsp;</A></B> So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half their beards and cut away half their garments at the buttocks, and he sent them away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:5">10:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Now when they told <I>this</I> to David, he sent <I>some</I> to meet them, for the men were very ashamed. And the king said, Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, then return.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:6">10:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah <I>with</I> one thousand men, and the men of Tob, twelve thousand men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:7">10:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And when David heard <I>of it,</I> he sent Joab and all the host of mighty men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:8">10:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the children of Ammon went forth and set the battle in array at the entrance of the gate; but the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and of Maacah were alone in the field.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:9">10:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Now when Joab saw that there were battle lines against him before and behind, he chose some of the choice men in Israel and set <I>them</I> in array against the Syrians.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:10">10:10&nbsp;</A></B> And the rest of the people he put under the charge of Abishai his brother and set <I>them</I> in array against the children of Ammon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:11">10:11&nbsp;</A></B> And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; and if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:12">10:12&nbsp;</A></B> Be strong and let us be bold for the sake of our people and for the sake of the cities of our God, and may Jehovah do what seems good in His sight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:13">10:13&nbsp;</A></B> So Joab and the people who were with him approached the battle against the Syrians, and the Syrians fled before him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:14">10:14&nbsp;</A></B> And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, and they fled from before Abishai and entered the city. And Joab returned from the children of Ammon and entered Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:15">10:15&nbsp;</A></B> Now when the Syrians saw that they had been routed before Israel, they gathered themselves together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:16">10:16&nbsp;</A></B> And Hadadezer sent <I>word</I> and brought forth the Syrians who were beyond the River. And they came to Helem, and Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer was before them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:17">10:17&nbsp;</A></B> And it was told David, and he gathered all Israel together and passed over the Jordan and came to Helem. And the Syrians set themselves in array to meet David, and they fought with him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:18">10:18&nbsp;</A></B> And the Syrians fled before Israel. And David slew seven hundred charioteers of the Syrians and forty thousand horsemen; and he struck Shobach the captain of their army, and he died there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:19">10:19&nbsp;</A></B> And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.<BR>
