</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:1">13:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:2">13:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their heart, Hear the word of Jehovah:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:3">13:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:4">13:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Your prophets, O Israel, have become like foxes among ruins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:5">13:5 &nbsp;</A></B> You have not gone up to the breaches nor built up the wall for the house of Israel that it might stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:6">13:6 &nbsp;</A></B> They have seen vanity and deceptive divination, they who say, Jehovah declares! when Jehovah has not sent them; but they expect that He will fulfill <I>their</I> word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:7">13:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken deceptive divination when you say, Jehovah declares! and I have not spoken?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:8">13:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Because you have spoken vanity and have seen deceptive visions, therefore I am now against you, declares the Lord Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:9">13:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And My hand will be upon the prophets who see vanity and perform deceptive divination; they shall not be in the council of My people, nor shall they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you will know that I am the Lord Jehovah;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:10">13:10&nbsp;</A></B> Because, indeed because, they have led My people astray, saying, Peace, when there is no peace; but it is <I>as if</I> someone builds up a wall, and immediately they plaster it over with untempered mortar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:11">13:11&nbsp;</A></B> Tell those who plaster over with untempered mortar that it will fall. There will be a flooding rain; and you, O hailstones, will fall; and a tempestuous wind will break <I>it</I> down.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:12">13:12&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, Where is the plaster with which you plastered <I>it?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:13">13:13&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, I will cause a tempestuous wind to break forth in My wrath, and there will be a flooding rain in My anger, and hailstones to consume <I>it</I> in wrath.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:14">13:14&nbsp;</A></B> And I will tear down the wall that you plastered over with untempered mortar and will tear it down to the ground, so that its foundation is uncovered; and it will fall, and you will be consumed in the midst of it; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:15">13:15&nbsp;</A></B> And I will spend My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it over with untempered mortar; and I will say to you, The wall is not there, and those who plaster it over are not there,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:16">13:16&nbsp;</A></B> The prophets of Israel, who prophesy concerning Jerusalem and see visions of peace for her, when there is no peace, declares the Lord Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:17">13:17&nbsp;</A></B> And you, son of man, set your face toward the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their heart, and prophesy against them<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:18">13:18&nbsp;</A></B> And say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the women who sew bands on all the wrists and make caps for the heads <I>of persons</I> of every stature, so as to hunt down souls! Will you hunt down the souls of My people while you preserve alive the souls <I>of others</I> for yourselves?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:19">13:19&nbsp;</A></B> And you have profaned Me before My people for some handfuls of barley and for some pieces of bread by putting to death some people who should not die and preserving alive other people who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to your lies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:20">13:20&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am now against your bands with which you hunt down souls there as <I>you would</I> birds; and I will tear them off your arms and will release the souls, which souls you hunt down as <I>you would</I> birds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:21">13:21&nbsp;</A></B> I will also tear off your caps and will deliver My people from your hand, and they will no longer be in your hand to be hunted down; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:22">13:22&nbsp;</A></B> Because you discouraged the heart of the righteous man with lies, though I Myself did not pain him, and strengthened the hands of the wicked man so that he would not turn from his evil way and you would cause him to live,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="13:23">13:23&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore you will no <I>longer</I> see vanity and you will no longer practice divination, but I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
