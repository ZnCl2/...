</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:1">22:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:2">22:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Can a man of might be of any use to God? / No, a man of insight is of use only to himself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:3">22:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Is it a matter of delight to the Almighty that you are righteous? / Or is it a gain <I>to Him</I> that you make your ways perfect?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:4">22:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Is it because of your fear <I>of Him</I> that He reproves you, / That He enters into judgment with you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:5">22:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Is not your wickedness great, / And is there no end to your iniquities?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:6">22:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For you have taken pledges from your brothers without cause / And stripped the naked of their clothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:7">22:7 &nbsp;</A></B> You have not given water to the weary to drink, / And you have withheld bread from the hungry.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:8">22:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And as for the man of power, the earth was his; / And the man of honor dwelt in it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:9">22:9 &nbsp;</A></B> You have sent away the widows empty, / And the arms of the orphans have been crushed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:10">22:10&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore snares are all around you; / And sudden dread troubles you,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:11">22:11&nbsp;</A></B> Or darkness, so that you cannot see; / And an abundance of waters covers you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:12">22:12&nbsp;</A></B> Is not God at the height of heaven? / And look at the highest of the stars, how lofty they are!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:13">22:13&nbsp;</A></B> And you say, What does God know? / Can He judge through the deep darkness?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:14">22:14&nbsp;</A></B> Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so He cannot see; / And He walks upon the circle of the heavens.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:15">22:15&nbsp;</A></B> Will you keep the old way, / Which wicked men have trodden?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:16">22:16&nbsp;</A></B> Such were snatched away before their time, / Whose foundation was poured forth like a stream;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:17">22:17&nbsp;</A></B> Who said to God, Depart from us; / And, What can the Almighty accomplish for us?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:18">22:18&nbsp;</A></B> Yet He fills their houses with good things. / But the counsel of the wicked is far from Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:19">22:19&nbsp;</A></B> The righteous see and rejoice, / And the innocent deride them,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:20">22:20&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Saying,</I> Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, / And the remnant of them the fire has devoured.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:21">22:21&nbsp;</A></B> Be well disposed to Him and at peace <I>with Him;</I> / By such, good will come upon you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:22">22:22&nbsp;</A></B> Receive instruction from His mouth, / And lay up His words in your heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:23">22:23&nbsp;</A></B> If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up. / If you put injustice far away from your tents,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:24">22:24&nbsp;</A></B> And place <I>your</I> gold nuggets in the dust / And <I>your gold of</I> Ophir in the stones of the brooks,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:25">22:25&nbsp;</A></B> Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets / And precious silver to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:26">22:26&nbsp;</A></B> For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, / And you will lift up your countenance to God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:27">22:27&nbsp;</A></B> You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; / And you will repay your vows.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:28">22:28&nbsp;</A></B> You will also decree something, and it will be established for you; / And light will shine on your ways.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:29">22:29&nbsp;</A></B> When they cast you down, you will say, <I>I am</I> up! / And the lowly person He will save.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="22:30">22:30&nbsp;</A></B> He will deliver him who is not innocent; / Yes, you will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.<BR>
