</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:1">40:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Comfort, oh, comfort My people, / Says your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:2">40:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Speak unto the heart of Jerusalem, / And cry out to her, / That her warfare has finished, / That <I>the penalty</I> for her iniquity has been accepted; / For she has received from the hand of Jehovah double / For all her sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:3">40:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The voice of one who cries / In the wilderness: Make clear / The way of Jehovah; / Make straight in the desert / A highway for our God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:4">40:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Every valley will be lifted up, / And every mountain and hill will be made low, / And the crooked places will become straight, / And the rough places, a broad plain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:5">40:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the glory of Jehovah will be revealed, / And all flesh will see <I>it</I> together, / Because the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:6">40:6 &nbsp;</A></B> A voice said, Cry out. / And he said, What shall I cry? / All flesh is grass / And all its glory is like the flower of the field;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:7">40:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The grass withers, the flower fades, / Because the breath of Jehovah blows upon it. / Surely the people are grass.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:8">40:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The grass withers and the flower fades, / But the word of our God will stand forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:9">40:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Go up to a high mountain, / O Zion, who brings glad tidings; / Lift up your voice with power, / O Jerusalem, who brings glad tidings; / Lift <I>it</I> up, Do not be afraid. / Say to the cities of Judah, / Behold your God!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:10">40:10&nbsp;</A></B> Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty One, / And His arm will rule for Him. / Behold, His reward is with Him, / And His recompense before Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:11">40:11&nbsp;</A></B> He will feed His flock as a Shepherd; / In His arm He will gather the lambs; / In His bosom He will carry <I>them.</I> / He will lead those who are nursing <I>the young.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:12">40:12&nbsp;</A></B> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, / Who has calculated <I>the extent of</I> the heavens with a handspan, / And measured out the dust of the earth by a measure, / And weighed the mountains in scales / And the hills in balances?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:13">40:13&nbsp;</A></B> Who has directed the Spirit of Jehovah, / Or who has made <I>matters</I> known to Him as His counselor?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:14">40:14&nbsp;</A></B> With whom did He consult and who instructed Him, / And taught Him in the path of justice, / And taught Him knowledge, / And caused Him to know the way of understanding?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:15">40:15&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed the nations are like a drop from a bucket, / And are accounted as specks of dust on the scales. / Indeed He takes up the islands as very fine powder.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:16">40:16&nbsp;</A></B> And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, / Nor are its beasts sufficient for a burnt offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:17">40:17&nbsp;</A></B> All the nations are as nothing before Him; / They are counted by Him as less than nothing and vanity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:18">40:18&nbsp;</A></B> To whom then will you liken God? / Or what likeness will you compare to Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:19">40:19&nbsp;</A></B> When the workman has cast an idol, / A goldsmith overlays it with gold / Also refining chains of silver <I>for it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:20">40:20&nbsp;</A></B> He that is <I>so</I> impoverished <I>that he lacks</I> an offering / Chooses wood that will not rot, / And seeks a skillful craftsman for himself / To prepare an idol that will not be moved.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:21">40:21&nbsp;</A></B> Do you not know? Have you not heard? / Has it not been told to you from the beginning? / Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:22">40:22&nbsp;</A></B> It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, / And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; / Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, / And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:23">40:23&nbsp;</A></B> Who brings the princes to nought; / He makes the judges of the earth as nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:24">40:24&nbsp;</A></B> They have scarcely been planted; / They have scarcely been sown; / Their stem has scarcely taken root in the earth; / Nevertheless He blows on them and they are withered, / And the storm wind carries them away like stubble.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:25">40:25&nbsp;</A></B> To whom will you liken Me, / That I should be compared? Says the Holy One.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:26">40:26&nbsp;</A></B> Lift up your eyes on high, / And see who has created these things, / Who brings out their host by number; / He calls all of them by name. / Through the greatness of His might and the strength of His power / Not one of them is missing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:27">40:27&nbsp;</A></B> Why do you say, O Jacob, / And why do you speak, O Israel, / My way is hidden from Jehovah, / And my judgment has been passed over by my God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:28">40:28&nbsp;</A></B> Do you not know, / Or have you not heard, / That the eternal God, Jehovah, / The Creator of the ends of the earth, / Does not faint and does not become weary? / There is no searching out of His understanding.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:29">40:29&nbsp;</A></B> He gives power to the faint, / And to those who have no vigor He multiplies strength.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:30">40:30&nbsp;</A></B> Although youths will faint and become weary, / And young men will collapse exhausted;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:31">40:31&nbsp;</A></B> Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew <I>their</I> strength; / They will mount up with wings like eagles; / They will run and will not faint; / They will walk and will not become weary.<BR>
