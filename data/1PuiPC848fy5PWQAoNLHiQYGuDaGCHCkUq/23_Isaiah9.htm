</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For You break the yoke of their burden / And the staff on their shoulder, / The rod of their oppressor, / As in the day of Midian.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> To the increase of <I>His</I> government / And to <I>His</I> peace there is no end, / Upon the throne of David / And over His kingdom, / To establish it / And to uphold it / In justice and righteousness / From now to eternity. / The zeal of Jehovah of hosts / Will accomplish this.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord sends out a word against Jacob, / And it descends upon Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And all the people know <I>it,</I> / Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, / Saying in pride and haughtiness of heart,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> The bricks have fallen, but we will build with cut stone; / The sycamores have been felled, but we will put cedars in their place.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west: / They devour Israel with an open mouth. / By all this His anger is not turned; / His hand is still outstretched.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, / Nor do they seek Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah cuts off from Israel head and tail, / Palm branch and marsh reed in one day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> The elder and the highly regarded&nbsp;— he is the head; / The prophet <I>and</I> the teacher of falsehood&nbsp;— he is the tail.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And those who lead this people are those who mislead <I>them;</I> / And those who are led are those who are confused.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of this the Lord will not rejoice in their young men, / And He will not have compassion on their orphans and widows; / For all of them are profane and evildoers, / And every mouth speaks foolishness. / By all this His anger is not turned; / His hand is still outstretched.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:18">&nbsp;9:18 &nbsp;</A></B> For wickedness burns like a fire; / It devours thorn and thistle, / And burns in the forest thickets; / And it rolls up <I>into</I> a column of smoke.<BR>
