</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:1">55:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Give ear, O God, to my prayer; / And do not hide Yourself from my supplication.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:2">55:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Give heed to me, and answer me. / I grow restless in my complaint and moan,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:3">55:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Because of the voice of the enemy, / Because of the oppression of the wicked man; / For they drop iniquity upon me, / And in anger they make me their enemy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:4">55:4 &nbsp;</A></B> My heart writhes within me, / And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:5">55:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Fear and trembling have come upon me, / And shuddering overwhelms me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:6">55:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And I say, Oh that I had wings like a dove! / Then I would fly away and be at rest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:7">55:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed I would wander far away; / I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:8">55:8 &nbsp;</A></B> I would hasten my escape / From the storm wind and the tempest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:9">55:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Confuse, O Lord, divide their tongue; / For I have seen violence and contention in the city.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:10">55:10&nbsp;</A></B> Day and night they go around it, / Upon its walls; / And iniquity and trouble are in the midst of it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:11">55:11&nbsp;</A></B> Utter ruin is in the midst of it, / And oppression and deceit / Do not depart from its streets.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:12">55:12&nbsp;</A></B> For it is not an enemy who reproaches me; / Otherwise I could bear it. / It is not he who hates me who magnifies himself against me; / Otherwise I could hide myself from him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:13">55:13&nbsp;</A></B> But it is you, my equal, / My close friend and my acquaintance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:14">55:14&nbsp;</A></B> We were in sweet counsel together; / We walked with the throng in the house of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:15">55:15&nbsp;</A></B> Let death surprise them; / May they go down into Sheol alive. / For evil is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:16">55:16&nbsp;</A></B> As for me, I call out to God, / And Jehovah will save me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:17">55:17&nbsp;</A></B> Evening and morning and at noontime / I complain and moan, / And He hears my voice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:18">55:18&nbsp;</A></B> He has redeemed my soul in peace / From the battle against me, / For many are they <I>who strive</I> with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:19">55:19&nbsp;</A></B> God hears and answers them&nbsp;— / Even He who sits <I>enthroned</I> from of old&nbsp;— Selah / Because with them there is no change, / And they do not fear God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:20">55:20&nbsp;</A></B> He put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; / He profaned his covenant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:21">55:21&nbsp;</A></B> Smooth were the buttery words of his mouth, / But his heart was war; / More soothing than oil were his words, / But they were <I>in fact</I> drawn swords.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:22">55:22&nbsp;</A></B> Cast your burden upon Jehovah, / And He will sustain you; / He will never allow the righteous to be moved.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="55:23">55:23&nbsp;</A></B> But You, O God, will bring them down / Into the pit of decay.<BR>
Men of bloodshed and deceit / Will not live out half their days; / But I will trust in You.<BR>
