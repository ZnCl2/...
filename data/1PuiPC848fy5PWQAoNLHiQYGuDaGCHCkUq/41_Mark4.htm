</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And again He began to teach beside the sea, and a very great crowd was gathered unto Him, so that He stepped into a boat in the sea and sat down, and all the crowd was on the land, facing the sea.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And He taught them many things in parables and said to them in His teaching:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And as he sowed, some <I>seed</I> fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And other <I>seed</I> fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And other <I>seed</I> fell into the thorns, and the thorns came up and utterly choked it, and it yielded no fruit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And others fell into the good earth and yielded fruit, coming up and growing; and one bore thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one a hundredfold.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And when He was alone, those around Him, with the twelve, asked Him about the parables.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, To you it has been given <I>to know</I> the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those outside, all things are in parables,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> In order that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest they turn and it be forgiven them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how will you know all the parables?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> The sower sows the word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And these are the ones beside the way, where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown into them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet they have no root in themselves, but last only for a time; then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they are stumbled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And others are the ones being sown into the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts for other things enter in and utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:20">&nbsp;4:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And these are the ones sown on the good earth: <I>those</I> who hear the word and receive <I>it</I> and bear fruit, one thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one a hundredfold.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:21">&nbsp;4:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Does the lamp come so that it may be placed under the bushel or under the bed? <I>Does it</I> not <I>come</I> that it may be placed on the lampstand?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:22">&nbsp;4:22 &nbsp;</A></B> For nothing is hidden except that it may be manifested, nor has <I>anything</I> become concealed but that it may come into the open.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:23">&nbsp;4:23 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:24">&nbsp;4:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you, and it shall be added to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:25">&nbsp;4:25 &nbsp;</A></B> For he who has, it shall be given to him; and he who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:26">&nbsp;4:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said, So is the kingdom of God: as if a man cast seed on the earth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:27">&nbsp;4:27 &nbsp;</A></B> And sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens&nbsp;— how, he does not know.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:28">&nbsp;4:28 &nbsp;</A></B> The earth bears fruit by itself: first a blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:29">&nbsp;4:29 &nbsp;</A></B> But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:30">&nbsp;4:30 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God, or in what parable shall we present it?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:31">&nbsp;4:31 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>It is</I> like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:32">&nbsp;4:32 &nbsp;</A></B> And when it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the herbs and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shade.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:33">&nbsp;4:33 &nbsp;</A></B> And in many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:34">&nbsp;4:34 &nbsp;</A></B> And without a parable He did not speak to them; but privately to His own disciples He explained all things.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:35">&nbsp;4:35 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them on that day when evening had fallen, Let us go over to the other side.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:36">&nbsp;4:36 &nbsp;</A></B> And leaving the crowd, they took Him along, just as He was, in the boat; and other boats were with Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:37">&nbsp;4:37 &nbsp;</A></B> And there arose a great windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already beginning to fill up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:38">&nbsp;4:38 &nbsp;</A></B> And He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. And they woke Him and said to Him, Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:39">&nbsp;4:39 &nbsp;</A></B> And having awoken, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Be silent! Be still! And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:40">&nbsp;4:40 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Why are you cowardly in this way? How <I>is it that</I> you do not have faith?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:41">&nbsp;4:41 &nbsp;</A></B> And they became greatly frightened and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?<BR>
