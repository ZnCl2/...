</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He became hungry.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But He answered and said, It is written, “Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the devil took Him into the holy city and set Him on the wing of the temple,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, “To His angels He shall give charge concerning You, and on <I>their</I> hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.”<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said to Him, All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it is written, “You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Now when He heard that John was delivered up, He withdrew into Galilee.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is beside the sea in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And while He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:20">&nbsp;4:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And immediately leaving the nets, they followed Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:21">&nbsp;4:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And going on from there, He saw another two brothers, James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:22">&nbsp;4:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And immediately leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:23">&nbsp;4:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:24">&nbsp;4:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And the report concerning Him went out into all of Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those afflicted with various diseases and torments and those possessed by demons and epileptics and paralytics; and He healed them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:25">&nbsp;4:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And great crowds followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and <I>from</I> beyond the Jordan.<BR>
