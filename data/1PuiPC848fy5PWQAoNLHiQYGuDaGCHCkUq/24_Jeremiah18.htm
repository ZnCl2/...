</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:1">18:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:2">18:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will let you hear My words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:3">18:3 &nbsp;</A></B> So I went down to the potter’s house, and he was there doing work at his wheel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:4">18:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter’s hand; so he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good for the potter to make.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:5">18:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:6">18:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Am I not able to do with you, O house of Israel, as this potter does? declares Jehovah. Indeed, as the clay is in the hand of the potter, so you are in My hand, O house of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:7">18:7 &nbsp;</A></B> At the moment that I speak about a nation or about a kingdom, to pluck <I>it</I> up or to break <I>it</I> down or to destroy <I>it,</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:8">18:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And if that nation concerning which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:9">18:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And at the moment that I speak about a nation or a kingdom, to build <I>it</I> up or to plant <I>it,</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:10">18:10&nbsp;</A></B> And if it does evil in My sight by not listening to My voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit it.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:11">18:11&nbsp;</A></B> And now speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Look, I am forming evil against you and devising a plan against you. Return now, each one of you from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:12">18:12&nbsp;</A></B> But they say, It is hopeless! For we will walk after our own devices and everyone will do <I>according to</I> the stubbornness of his evil heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:13">18:13&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah, / Ask now among the nations, / Who has heard such things? / The virgin of Israel / Has done a very horrible thing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:14">18:14&nbsp;</A></B> Does the snow of Lebanon / Leave the rock of the field? / Or will the cold flowing waters / Coming from afar be dried up?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:15">18:15&nbsp;</A></B> But My people have forgotten Me; / They burn incense to vanity,<BR>
And they have been stumbled in their ways / <I>From</I> the ancient paths / To walk on bypaths, / On a way which is not cast up,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:16">18:16&nbsp;</A></B> To make their land an astonishment, / A thing to be hissed at forever. / Everyone who passes by will be astonished / And shake his head.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:17">18:17&nbsp;</A></B> Like the east wind I will scatter them / Before the enemy; / I will show them <I>My</I> back and not <I>My</I> face / In the day of their calamity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:18">18:18&nbsp;</A></B> Then they said, Come, let us devise plots against Jeremiah; for the law will not perish from the priest or counsel from the wise man or a word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:19">18:19&nbsp;</A></B> Give heed to me, O Jehovah, / And listen to the voice of those who contend with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:20">18:20&nbsp;</A></B> Shall evil be recompensed with good? / For they have dug a pit for my life. / Remember how I stood before You / To speak good for their sake, / To turn away Your wrath from them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:21">18:21&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore deliver up their children to famine, / And give them over to the power of the sword; / And let their wives become / Bereaved of child and be widows; / And let their men be slaughtered to death, / Their young men struck by the sword in battle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:22">18:22&nbsp;</A></B> Let a cry be heard from their houses / When You suddenly bring upon them a troop; / For they have dug a pit to capture me / And have hidden snares for my feet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:23">18:23&nbsp;</A></B> Yet You, O Jehovah, know / All their counsel against me for <I>my</I> death. / Do not be propitious to their iniquity, / And do not blot out their sin from before You; / But let them be overthrown before You; / Deal with them in the time of Your anger.<BR>
