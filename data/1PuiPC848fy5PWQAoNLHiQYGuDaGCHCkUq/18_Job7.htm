</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Does not man have a term of hard service on earth? / And are his days not like the days of a hired hand?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Like a servant who longs for the shade, / And like a hired hand who waits for his pay,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> So I am made to inherit months of vanity, / And nights of trouble are appointed to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> If I lie down, I say, / When will I arise? But the evening is long, / And I am full of tossings until the dawn.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt clods; / My skin crusts and then oozes again.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle / And are spent without hope.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember that my life is a breath; / My eye will not see good again.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The eye of him who sees me will not look on me; / Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The cloud is consumed and goes away: / Likewise he who goes down into Sheol does not come up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> He returns no more to his house, / Nor does his place know him anymore.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For my part, I also will not restrain my mouth; / I will speak in the distress of my spirit; / I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Am I the sea, or a sea serpent, / That You must set a watch over me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> When I say, My bed will comfort me, / My couch will bear up my complaint;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Then You scare me with dreams / And terrify me with visions,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> So that my soul would choose strangulation / <I>And</I> death rather than my bones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> I loathe <I>life;</I> I would not live forever. / Leave me alone, for my days are a <I>mere</I> breath.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> What is mortal man that You magnify him, / And that You consider him,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:18">&nbsp;7:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And that You visit him every morning, / You try him every moment?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:19">&nbsp;7:19 &nbsp;</A></B> How long before You look away from me, / Before You abandon me until I swallow my spittle?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:20">&nbsp;7:20 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>If</I> I have sinned, what have I done to You, O Watcher of man? / Why have You made me Your target so that I have become a burden to You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:21">&nbsp;7:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And why do You not forgive my transgression / And take away my iniquity? / For now I may lie down in the dust; / And You will seek me out, and I will not be.<BR>
