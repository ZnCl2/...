</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> By means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, of men who are branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Who forbid marriage <I>and command</I> abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if received with thanksgiving;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> If you lay these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But the profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For to this end we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Charge and teach these things.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Until I come, attend to the public reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Practice these things; be in them, that your progress may be manifest to all.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Take heed to yourself and to your teaching; continue in these things; for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.<BR>
