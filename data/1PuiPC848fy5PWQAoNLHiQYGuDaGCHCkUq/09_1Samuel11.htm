</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:1">11:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Nahash the Ammonite went up and encamped against Jabesh-gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:2">11:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition I will make <I>a treaty</I> with you, that all your right eyes be gouged out; and I will make it a reproach upon all Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:3">11:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days’ respite that we may send messengers throughout all the territory of Israel. And if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:4">11:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the messengers went to Gibeah of Saul, and they spoke these words in the hearing of the people. And all the people lifted up their voice and wept.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:5">11:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And Saul was just coming from the field after the oxen, and Saul said, What is wrong with the people that they weep <I>so?</I> And they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:6">11:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul as he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:7">11:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them into pieces and sent <I>them</I> throughout all the territory of Israel by means of the messengers, saying, Whoever does not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the dread of Jehovah fell upon the people, and they came forth as one man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:8">11:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And he mustered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah were thirty thousand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:9">11:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And they said to the messengers who had come, Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow you will have deliverance by the time the sun is hot. So the messengers went and told <I>this</I> to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:10">11:10&nbsp;</A></B> And the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do to us all that seems good in your sight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:11">11:11&nbsp;</A></B> And on the next day Saul put the people into three companies, and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch. And they struck Ammon until the day was hot; and those who remained were so scattered that not two of them remained together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:12">11:12&nbsp;</A></B> And the people said to Samuel, Who said, Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men that we may put them to death.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:13">11:13&nbsp;</A></B> But Saul said, No man shall be put to death on this day, for today Jehovah has accomplished deliverance in Israel.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:14">11:14&nbsp;</A></B> Then Samuel said to the people, Come and let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="11:15">11:15&nbsp;</A></B> And all the people went to Gilgal. And there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal, and there they sacrificed peace offerings before Jehovah, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.<BR>
