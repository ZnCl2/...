</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:1">44:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east, but it was shut.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:2">44:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to me, This gate will remain shut; it will not be opened, nor will any man enter through it, for Jehovah the God of Israel has entered through it; therefore it will remain shut.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:3">44:3 &nbsp;</A></B> As for the Prince, He will sit in it as a prince to eat food before Jehovah; He will enter through the porch of the gate and go out the same way.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:4">44:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He brought me through the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and just then the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah, and I fell upon my face.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:5">44:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, pay attention, and look with your eyes, and listen with your ears to all that I say to you concerning all the statutes of the house of Jehovah and all its laws; and pay attention to the entrance of the house, with every exit of the sanctuary.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:6">44:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Enough, O house of Israel, of all your abominations,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:7">44:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Inasmuch as you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to profane it, My house, when you presented My bread, the fat and the blood. And <I>in addition</I> to all your abominations, you broke My covenant.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:9">44:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, of any of the foreigners who are among the children of Israel shall enter into My sanctuary.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:10">44:10&nbsp;</A></B> But the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who went astray from Me after their idols, shall bear their iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:11">44:11&nbsp;</A></B> Yet they shall minister in My sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house. They shall slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:12">44:12&nbsp;</A></B> Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn concerning them, declares the Lord Jehovah, that they shall bear their iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:13">44:13&nbsp;</A></B> And they shall not come near to Me to serve Me as a priest, nor come near to any of My holy things, to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their disgrace and their abominations which they have committed.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:15">44:15&nbsp;</A></B> But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to minister to Me; and they shall stand before Me to present to Me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord Jehovah,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:16">44:16&nbsp;</A></B> It is they who will enter My sanctuary, and it is they who will come near to My table to minister to Me, and they will keep My charge.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="44:25">44:25&nbsp;</A></B> And they shall not go to any dead person to defile themselves. Only for a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, or a sister who has had no husband may they defile themselves.<BR>
