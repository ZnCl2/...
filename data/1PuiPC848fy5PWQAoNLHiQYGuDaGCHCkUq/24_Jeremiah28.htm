</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:2">28:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:3">28:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Within two full years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon took from this place and carried to Babylon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:4">28:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, I will bring back to this place, declares Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:5">28:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who were standing in the house of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:6">28:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen! May Jehovah do so. May Jehovah establish your words which you have prophesied and bring back the vessels of the house of Jehovah and all the exiles from Babylon to this place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:7">28:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Nevertheless hear now this word which I am about to speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:8">28:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The prophets who were before me and before you since long ago prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms, of war and of evil and of pestilence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:9">28:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then the prophet will be known <I>as</I> one whom Jehovah has truly sent.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:11">28:11&nbsp;</A></B> And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two full years.

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:12">28:12&nbsp;</A></B> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke bar from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:13">28:13&nbsp;</A></B> Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah, You have broken the wooden yoke bars, but you have made in their place iron yoke bars.<BR>
