</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:2">36:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For he flatters himself in his own eyes, / That his iniquity cannot be found out <I>and</I> hated.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:3">36:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; / He has ceased being wise <I>and</I> doing good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="36:4">36:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He plans wickedness on his bed; / He sets himself on a way that is not good; / He does not reject evil.<BR>
