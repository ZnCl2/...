</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But in its own times manifested His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the command of our Savior God;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things <I>which I have begun</I> that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone is unreprovable, the husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of dissoluteness or unruly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For the overseer must be unreprovable as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, not greedy for base gain;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But hospitable, a lover of good, of a sober mind, righteous, holy, self-controlled;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching <I>of the apostles,</I> that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Whose mouths must be stopped, who overthrow whole households, teaching things for the sake of base gain, which they ought not to do.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> One from among themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> This testimony is true; for which cause reprove them severely that they may be healthy in the faith,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> All things are pure to the pure; yet to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> They profess to know God, but by their works they deny <I>Him,</I> being abominable and disobedient and, as to every good work, disapproved.<BR>
