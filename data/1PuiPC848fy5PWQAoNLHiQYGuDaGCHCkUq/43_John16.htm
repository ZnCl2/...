</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:1">16:1 &nbsp;</A></B> These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be stumbled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:2">16:2 &nbsp;</A></B> They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:3">16:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:4">16:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you <I>of them.</I> Now these things I have not said to you from the beginning, because I was with you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:5">16:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, Where are You going?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:6">16:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:7">16:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:8">16:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:9">16:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:10">16:10&nbsp;</A></B> And concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:11">16:11&nbsp;</A></B> And concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:12">16:12&nbsp;</A></B> I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear <I>them</I> now.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:13">16:13&nbsp;</A></B> But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:14">16:14&nbsp;</A></B> He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare <I>it</I> to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:15">16:15&nbsp;</A></B> All that the Father has is Mine; for this <I>reason</I> I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare <I>it</I> to you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:16">16:16&nbsp;</A></B> A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:17">16:17&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Some</I> of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:18">16:18&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:19">16:19&nbsp;</A></B> Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him and He said to them, Are you inquiring among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:20">16:20&nbsp;</A></B> Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:21">16:21&nbsp;</A></B> A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:22">16:22&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:23">16:23&nbsp;</A></B> And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:24">16:24&nbsp;</A></B> Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:25">16:25&nbsp;</A></B> These things I have spoken to you in parables; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but I will report to you plainly concerning the Father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:26">16:26&nbsp;</A></B> In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:27">16:27&nbsp;</A></B> For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:28">16:28&nbsp;</A></B> I came forth out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:29">16:29&nbsp;</A></B> His disciples said, Behold, now You are speaking plainly and not saying any parable.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:30">16:30&nbsp;</A></B> Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone ask You; by this we believe that You came forth from God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:31">16:31&nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:32">16:32&nbsp;</A></B> Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:33">16:33&nbsp;</A></B> These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world.<BR>
