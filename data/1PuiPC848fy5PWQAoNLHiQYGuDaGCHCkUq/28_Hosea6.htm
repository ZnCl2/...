</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Come and let us return to Jehovah; / For He has torn <I>us,</I> but He will heal us, / And He has stricken <I>us,</I> but He will bind us up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up, / And we will live in His presence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore let us know, let us pursue knowing Jehovah: / His going forth is as sure as the dawn, / And He will come to us as the rain, / As the late rain which waters the earth.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? / What shall I do with you, O Judah? / For your lovingkindness is like a morning cloud / And like dew that departs early.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I hewed <I>them</I> to pieces by the prophets; / I slew them by the words of My mouth, / And My judgments went forth as light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For I delight in lovingkindness and not sacrifice, / And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant; / There they have acted treacherously against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Gilead is a city of those who commit iniquity; / It is tracked with blood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And like bands of robbers lying in wait for a man, / The company of priests murder on the way to Shechem; / Indeed they commit wickedness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> In the house of Israel I have seen a horrid thing: / The harlotry of Ephraim is there; / Israel has defiled itself.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, / When I will turn the captivity of My people.<BR>
