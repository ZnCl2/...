</P><B><A NAME="1"><P class="verse">1 &nbsp;</A></B> The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truthfulness, and not only I but also all those who know the truth,<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="2"><P class="verse">2 &nbsp;</A></B> For the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="3"><P class="verse">3 &nbsp;</A></B> Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="4"><P class="verse">4 &nbsp;</A></B> I rejoiced greatly that I have found <I>some</I> of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="5"><P class="verse">5 &nbsp;</A></B> And now I ask you, lady, not as writing a new commandment to you but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="6"><P class="verse">6 &nbsp;</A></B> And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you walk in love.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="7"><P class="verse">7 &nbsp;</A></B> For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="8"><P class="verse">8 &nbsp;</A></B> Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward.<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="9"><P class="verse">9 &nbsp;</A></B> Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="10"><P class="verse">10&nbsp;</A></B> If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into <I>your</I> house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="11"><P class="verse">11&nbsp;</A></B> For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="12"><P class="verse">12&nbsp;</A></B> Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to <I>do so</I> with paper and ink, but I am hoping to be with you and to speak face to face that our joy may be made full.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="13"><P class="verse">13&nbsp;</A></B> The children of your chosen sister greet you.<BR>
