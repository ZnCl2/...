</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:1">39:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I said, I will keep my ways, / So that I do not sin with my tongue; / I will keep a muzzle on my mouth / When the wicked are before me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:2">39:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I was dumb and silent; / I held my peace, <I>even</I> from good; / And my pain was stirred up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:3">39:3 &nbsp;</A></B> My heart was hot within me; / While I mused, the fire burned; / I spoke with my tongue:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:4">39:4 &nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, cause me to know my end, / And the measure of my days, what it is. / May I know how transient I am.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:5">39:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Behold, You have made my days as <I>mere</I> handbreadths, / And my lifetime is as nothing before You; / Surely every man at his best is altogether vanity. Selah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:6">39:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Surely man goes about as a semblance; / Surely they bustle about in vain: / He heaps up <I>riches</I> yet knows not / Who will gather them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:7">39:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And now what am I waiting for, O Lord? / My hope&nbsp;— it is in You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:8">39:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Deliver me from all my transgressions; / Do not make me the fool’s reproach.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:9">39:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I was dumb; I did not open my mouth; / For You have done <I>this.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:10">39:10&nbsp;</A></B> Remove Your plague from me; / By the hostility of Your hand I am consumed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:11">39:11&nbsp;</A></B> With rebukes You chasten a man because of iniquity, / And cause what is desirous to him to disappear like a moth. / Surely every man is vanity. Selah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:12">39:12&nbsp;</A></B> Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; / And give ear to my cry; / Do not hold Your peace at my tears. / For I am a stranger with You, / A sojourner, as all my fathers were.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="39:13">39:13&nbsp;</A></B> Look away from me, that I may be cheerful, / Before I go away and am no more.<BR>
