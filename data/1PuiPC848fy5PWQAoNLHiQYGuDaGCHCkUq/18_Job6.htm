</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Oh that my vexation were weighed indeed, / And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with <I>it!</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; / Therefore my words have been rash.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For the arrows of the Almighty are in me, / The poison of which my spirit drinks up; / The terrors of God are arrayed against me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Does the wild ass bray over <I>its</I> grass? / Or does the ox low over its fodder?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Is what is savorless eaten without salt? / Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> My soul refuses to touch <I>them;</I> / They are like putrid food to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Oh that I might have my request, / And that God would grant <I>me</I> what I long for;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> That God would be willing to crush me; / That He would release His hand and cut me off!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Then there would still be comfort for me; / And I would exult, <I>even</I> in writhing pain that does not spare, / That I did not deny the words of the Holy One.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> What is my strength, that I should wait? / And what is my end, that I should be patient?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Is my strength the strength of stones? / Or is my flesh bronze?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Is there any help for me at all within me, / And has wisdom been driven away from me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> To him who is fainting <I>there should be</I> kindness from his friend, / Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> My brothers have dealt as treacherously as a desert brook, / As the rivulets of the desert brooks that pass away,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:16">&nbsp;6:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Which are turbid because of the ice, / <I>And</I> into which the snow hides itself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:17">&nbsp;6:17 &nbsp;</A></B> When they are scorched, they are completely consumed; / When it is hot, they are dried up from their place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:18">&nbsp;6:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Caravans divert their ways <I>for them;</I> / They go up into the waste and perish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:19">&nbsp;6:19 &nbsp;</A></B> The caravans of Tema look <I>for them;</I> / The companies of Sheba long for them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:20">&nbsp;6:20 &nbsp;</A></B> They are put to shame because they are confident; / They go there and are confounded.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:21">&nbsp;6:21 &nbsp;</A></B> So now you have become such; / You see a terrible thing and are afraid.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:22">&nbsp;6:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Have I said, Give me <I>something?</I> / Or, Pay a bribe for me out of your wealth?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:23">&nbsp;6:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? / Or, From the hand of the oppressors redeem me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:24">&nbsp;6:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Teach me, and I will be silent; / Cause me to understand how I have erred.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:25">&nbsp;6:25 &nbsp;</A></B> How forceful are upright words! / But what does <I>this</I> reproving from you reprove?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:26">&nbsp;6:26 &nbsp;</A></B> Do you think you can reprove words? / But the words of a desperate man are for the wind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:27">&nbsp;6:27 &nbsp;</A></B> You would even cast <I>lots</I> over the orphan / And bargain over your friend.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:28">&nbsp;6:28 &nbsp;</A></B> Now then be pleased to look upon me, / For surely I will not lie to your face.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:29">&nbsp;6:29 &nbsp;</A></B> Turn now; let there be no injustice. / Indeed turn; my righteousness is still here.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:30">&nbsp;6:30 &nbsp;</A></B> Is there any injustice on my tongue? / Can my palate not discern calamities?<BR>
