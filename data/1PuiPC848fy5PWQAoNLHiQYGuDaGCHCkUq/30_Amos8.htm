</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:1">&nbsp;8:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me, and there was a basket of summer fruit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:2">&nbsp;8:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said, What do you see, Amos? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then Jehovah said to me,<BR>The end has come upon My people Israel; / I will not pass them by anymore.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:3">&nbsp;8:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And the songs of the temple will be wailings / In that day, declares the Lord Jehovah. / The corpses will be many; / In every place / They will cast <I>them.</I> Hush!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:4">&nbsp;8:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear this, you who pant after the needy / To destroy the wretched of the earth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:5">&nbsp;8:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Saying, When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? / And the Sabbath, that we may lay open the wheat? / In order to make the ephah small and the shekel large / And to falsify the balances for deceit;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:6">&nbsp;8:6 &nbsp;</A></B> That we may buy the poor for silver / And the needy for a pair of sandals, / And sell the refuse of the wheat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:7">&nbsp;8:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, / I shall by no means forget any of their deeds forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:8">&nbsp;8:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Will the land not quake because of this, / And will all who dwell in it <I>not</I> mourn? / Indeed all of it will rise up like the River, / And it will be driven and will sink like the river of Egypt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:9">&nbsp;8:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And in that day, / Declares the Lord Jehovah, / I will cause the sun to go down at noon, / And I will darken the land in the light of day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:10">&nbsp;8:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will turn your feasts into mourning / And all your songs into lamentation; / And I will bring up sackcloth upon all the loins / And baldness upon every head; / And I will make it like the mourning for an only child / And the end of it like a bitter day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:11">&nbsp;8:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed days are coming, / Declares the Lord Jehovah, / When I will send a hunger into the land, / Not a hunger for bread / Nor a thirst for water, / But for hearing the words of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:12">&nbsp;8:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And they will totter from sea to sea, / And from the north even to the east; / They will rove about, seeking the word of Jehovah, / But they will not find <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:13">&nbsp;8:13 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men / Will swoon because of thirst.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:14">&nbsp;8:14 &nbsp;</A></B> They who swear by the trespass of Samaria / And say, As your god lives, O Dan! / And, As the way of Beer-sheba lives! / Indeed they will fall and not rise up again.<BR>
