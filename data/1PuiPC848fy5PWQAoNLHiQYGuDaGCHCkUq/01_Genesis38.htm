</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:1">38:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched <I>his tent</I> near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:2">38:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her and went in to her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:3">38:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:4">38:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:5">38:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And yet again she bore a son and called his name Shelah, and she was in Chezib when she bore him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:6">38:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:7">38:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah put him to death.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:8">38:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up seed to your brother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:9">38:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But since Onan knew that the seed would not be his, whenever he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled <I>it</I> on the ground, so that he would not give seed to his brother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:10">38:10&nbsp;</A></B> But what he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, so He put him to death also.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:11">38:11&nbsp;</A></B> Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father’s house until Shelah my son grows up. For he thought, He also may die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:12">38:12&nbsp;</A></B> And in process of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:13">38:13&nbsp;</A></B> And it was told to Tamar, saying, Your father-in-law is now going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:14">38:14&nbsp;</A></B> And she removed from herself her widow’s garments and covered <I>herself</I> with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as <I>his</I> wife.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:15">38:15&nbsp;</A></B> And when Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:16">38:16&nbsp;</A></B> And he turned aside to her by the way and said, Come now, let me come in to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:17">38:17&nbsp;</A></B> And he said, I will send <I>you</I> a kid from the flock. And she said, Only if you give me a pledge until you send <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:18">38:18&nbsp;</A></B> And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your seal and your cord and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave <I>them</I> to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:19">38:19&nbsp;</A></B> And she arose and went away, and removed her veil from herself and put on her widow’s garments.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:20">38:20&nbsp;</A></B> And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand; but he did not find her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:21">38:21&nbsp;</A></B> Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute who was by the road at Enaim? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:22">38:22&nbsp;</A></B> And he returned to Judah and said, I did not find her; and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:23">38:23&nbsp;</A></B> And Judah said, Let her keep <I>the things</I> for herself, lest we become a laughing stock; you see, I sent <I>her</I> this kid, but you did not find her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:24">38:24&nbsp;</A></B> And about three months later it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; moreover, now she is pregnant by harlotry. And Judah said, Bring her out, and let her be burned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:25">38:25&nbsp;</A></B> As she was being brought out, she sent <I>word</I> to her father-in-law, saying, I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong. And she said, Please note whose these are, the seal and the cords and the staff.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:26">38:26&nbsp;</A></B> And Judah took note <I>of them</I> and said, She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah. And he did not know her again anymore.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:27">38:27&nbsp;</A></B> And at the time of her delivery, there were twins in her womb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:28">38:28&nbsp;</A></B> And while she was giving birth, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, This one came out first.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:29">38:29&nbsp;</A></B> But when he drew back his hand, his brother suddenly came out; and she said, What a breach you have made for yourself! Therefore his name was called Perez.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="38:30">38:30&nbsp;</A></B> And afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and his name was called Zerah.<BR>
