</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:1">25:1 &nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, You are my God; / I will exalt You, I will give thanks to Your name, / For You have done wonderful <I>things&nbsp;— </I> / Counsels of old, in faithfulness, <I>perfect</I> faithfulness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:2">25:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For You have made of a city a heap, / Of a fortified town a ruin. / A palace of strangers <I>becomes</I> no city <I>at all;</I> / It will never be rebuilt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:3">25:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore a strong people will glorify You; / The cities of terrifying nations will fear You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:4">25:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For You have been a stronghold to the weak, / A stronghold to the needy in his distress, / A refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat; / For the breath of those who terrify is like a tempest against a wall.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:5">25:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Like the heat in a drought, / You will subdue the uproar of strangers; / <I>Like</I> the heat through the shadow of a cloud, / The song of those who terrify will be brought low.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:6">25:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah of hosts will make on this mountain / For all the peoples / A feast of fat things, / A feast of wine <I>matured</I> on the lees, / Of fat things full of marrow, / <I>And</I> of filtered wine <I>matured</I> on the lees.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:7">25:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And on this mountain He will swallow up / The covering that covers up all the peoples, / Even the veil that veils all the nations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:8">25:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He will swallow up death forever; / And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces; / And the reproach of His people He will remove from all the earth; / For Jehovah has spoken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:9">25:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And it will be said in that day, / Here, this is our God, / For whom we have waited that He may save us. / This is Jehovah, for whom we have waited; / Let us be glad and rejoice in His salvation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:10">25:10&nbsp;</A></B> For the hand of Jehovah will rest on this mountain, / And Moab will be threshed in his place, / Even as straw is threshed in the water of a dung heap.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:11">25:11&nbsp;</A></B> And he will spread out his hands in the middle of it, / As a swimmer spreads out <I>his hands</I> to swim; / But <I>Jehovah</I> will abase his pride together with the trickery of his hands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="25:12">25:12&nbsp;</A></B> And the lofty fortification of your walls He will bring down, / Lay low, <I>and</I> cast to the ground, <I>even</I> to the dust.<BR>
