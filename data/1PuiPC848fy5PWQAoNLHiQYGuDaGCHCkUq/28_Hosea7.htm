</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> When I would heal Israel, / Then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered / As well as the evil deeds of Samaria; / For they practice falsehood. / And the thief comes inside; / The band of robbers makes raids outside.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And they do not say in their hearts / That I remember all their evil. / Now their doings are all around them; / They are before My face.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> They make the king glad with their evil, / And the princes, with their lies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> All of them practice adultery; / They are like an oven heated by the baker: / He ceases from stirring <I>the fire,</I> / After kneading the dough, until it is leavened.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> On the <I>feast</I> day of our king / The princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; / He stretched out his hand with scorners.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For they have made their heart ready / Like an oven while they lie in wait: / All night long / Their baker sleeps, / <I>But</I> in the morning the oven burns / Like a flaming fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> All of them are hot like an oven, / And they devour their judges; / All their kings fall; / There is no one among them who calls on Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Ephraim&nbsp;— among the peoples / He mixes himself; / Ephraim is a cake / Not turned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Strangers have devoured his strength, / And he himself does not know <I>it;</I> / Indeed gray hairs are all over him, / And he himself does not know <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And the pride of Israel testifies to his face; / Yet they have not returned to Jehovah their God, / And they have not sought <I>Him,</I> because of all this.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And Ephraim has become like a silly dove / Without understanding: / They call to Egypt; / They go to Assyria.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> When they go, / I will spread My net over them; / I will bring them down like the birds of heaven; / I will chasten them according to the report <I>given</I> to their assembly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to them! For they have wandered from Me. / Devastation to them! For they have transgressed against Me. / And I would have redeemed them, / But they have spoken lies against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And they did not cry unto Me in their heart / When they howled in their beds. / For grain and new wine they assemble themselves; / They rebel against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Though I trained <I>them and</I> strengthened their arms, / They devise evil against Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> They return, <I>but</I> not to <I>Him who is</I> on high; / They are like a deceitful bow. / Their princes will fall by the sword / Because of the rage of their tongue. / This will be their derision / In the land of Egypt.<BR>
