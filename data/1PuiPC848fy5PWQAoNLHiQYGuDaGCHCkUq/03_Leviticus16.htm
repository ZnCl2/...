</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:3">16:3 &nbsp;</A></B> In this way Aaron shall come into the Holy <I>of Holies:</I> with a bull of the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:10">16:10&nbsp;</A></B> But the goat on which the lot for Azazel fell shall be made to stand alive before Jehovah to make expiation over it, that it may be sent away for Azazel into the wilderness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:11">16:11&nbsp;</A></B> And Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make expiation for himself and for his household, and shall slaughter the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:12">16:12&nbsp;</A></B> And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before Jehovah, with his hands full of finely ground sweet incense, and bring <I>it</I> inside the veil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:13">16:13&nbsp;</A></B> And he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the expiation cover that is over the Testimony, so that he does not die.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:28">16:28&nbsp;</A></B> And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:29">16:29&nbsp;</A></B> And <I>this</I> shall become a perpetual statute for you; in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and not do any work, neither the native nor the sojourner who sojourns among you.<BR>
