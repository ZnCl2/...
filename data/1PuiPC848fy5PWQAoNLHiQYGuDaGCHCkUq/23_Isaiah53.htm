</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:1">53:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Who has believed our report? / And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:2">53:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground. / He has no <I>attracting</I> form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:3">53:3 &nbsp;</A></B> He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; / And like one from whom <I>men</I> hide their faces, / He was despised; and we did not esteem Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:4">53:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows; / Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:5">53:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But He was wounded because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:6">53:6 &nbsp;</A></B> We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:7">53:7 &nbsp;</A></B> He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:8">53:8 &nbsp;</A></B> By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who <I>among them</I> had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke <I>was due?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:9">53:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And they assigned His grave with the wicked, / But with a rich man in His death, / Although He had done no violence, / Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:10">53:10&nbsp;</A></B> But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. / When He makes Himself an offering for sin, / He will see a seed, He will extend <I>His</I> days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:11">53:11&nbsp;</A></B> He will see <I>the</I> <I>fruit</I> of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the / many righteous, / And He will bear their iniquities.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="53:12">53:12&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong; / Because He poured out His life unto death / And was numbered with the transgressors, / Yet He alone bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors.<BR>
