</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:1">&nbsp;9:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:2">&nbsp;9:2 &nbsp;</A></B> That I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:3">&nbsp;9:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For I could wish that I myself were a curse, <I>separated</I> from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:4">&nbsp;9:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Who are Israelites, whose are the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service and the promises;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:5">&nbsp;9:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Whose are the fathers, and out of whom, as regards what is according to flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:6">&nbsp;9:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But it is not as though the word of God has fallen away, for not all who are out of Israel are Israel;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:7">&nbsp;9:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Neither is it that because they are the seed of Abraham, they are all children; but, “In Isaac shall your seed be called,”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:8">&nbsp;9:8 &nbsp;</A></B> That is, <I>it is</I> not the children of the flesh <I>who</I> are the children of God, but the children of the promise are accounted as the seed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:9">&nbsp;9:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For this is the word of promise, “At this time <I>next year</I> I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:10">&nbsp;9:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And not only <I>so,</I> but Rebecca also, having conceived by one, Isaac our father,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:11">&nbsp;9:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Though <I>the children</I> had not yet been born nor had done anything good or bad (that the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works but of Him who calls),<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:12">&nbsp;9:12 &nbsp;</A></B> It was said to her, “The greater shall serve the less”;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:13">&nbsp;9:13 &nbsp;</A></B> As it is written, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:14">&nbsp;9:14 &nbsp;</A></B> What then shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? Absolutely not!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:15">&nbsp;9:15 &nbsp;</A></B> For to Moses He says, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:16">&nbsp;9:16 &nbsp;</A></B> So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:17">&nbsp;9:17 &nbsp;</A></B> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:18">&nbsp;9:18 &nbsp;</A></B> So then He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:19">&nbsp;9:19 &nbsp;</A></B> You will say to me then, Why does He still find fault? For who withstands His will?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:20">&nbsp;9:20 &nbsp;</A></B> But rather, O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:21">&nbsp;9:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:22">&nbsp;9:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And what if God, wishing to demonstrate His wrath and make His power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:23">&nbsp;9:23 &nbsp;</A></B> In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:24">&nbsp;9:24 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Even</I> us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:25">&nbsp;9:25 &nbsp;</A></B> As He also says in Hosea, “I will call those who were not My people My people, and her who was not beloved beloved;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:26">&nbsp;9:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:27">&nbsp;9:27 &nbsp;</A></B> And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, <I>it is</I> the remnant <I>that</I> shall be saved;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:28">&nbsp;9:28 &nbsp;</A></B> For the Lord will execute <I>His</I> word upon the earth, accomplishing <I>it</I> and cutting <I>it</I> short.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:29">&nbsp;9:29 &nbsp;</A></B> And as Isaiah has previously said, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:30">&nbsp;9:30 &nbsp;</A></B> What then shall we say? That the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have laid hold of righteousness, but a righteousness which is out of faith;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:31">&nbsp;9:31 &nbsp;</A></B> But Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to <I>that</I> law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:32">&nbsp;9:32 &nbsp;</A></B> Why? Because <I>they pursued it</I> not out of faith, but as it were out of works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="9:33">&nbsp;9:33 &nbsp;</A></B> As it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense, and he who believes on Him shall not be put to shame.”<BR>
