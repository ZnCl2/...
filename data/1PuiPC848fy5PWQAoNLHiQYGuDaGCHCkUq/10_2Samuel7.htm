</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And as the king dwelt in his house and Jehovah gave him rest all around from all his enemies,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the Ark of God dwells within curtains.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And Nathan said to the king, All that is in your heart go <I>and</I> do, for Jehovah is with you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And in that night the word of Jehovah came to Nathan, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Go and say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah, Is it you who will build Me a house for Me to dwell in?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For I have not dwelt in a house, since the day I brought the children of Israel up out of Egypt to this day; but I went about in a tent and in a tabernacle.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> In all My going about among all the children of Israel, did I ever speak a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And now thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you might be ruler over My people, over Israel;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And I have been with you in every place that you have gone and have cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make a great name for you, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them <I>there,</I> that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more; and the sons of wickedness will ill-treat them no more as before,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Even since the time when I commanded <I>that there be</I> judges over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover Jehovah declares to you that Jehovah will make you a house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> When your days are fulfilled and you sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which will come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> It is he who will build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> I will be his Father, and he will be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will strike him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> But My lovingkindness will not depart from him, as I took <I>it</I> away from Saul, whom I put away before you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you; your throne will be established forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> According to all these words and according to this whole vision did Nathan speak to David.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:18">&nbsp;7:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Then King David went and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Lord Jehovah, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:19">&nbsp;7:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And this was yet a small thing in Your sight, O Lord Jehovah; but You have spoken also of the house of Your servant for a great while to come; and is this the custom for man, O Lord Jehovah?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:20">&nbsp;7:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And what more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:21">&nbsp;7:21 &nbsp;</A></B> For Your word’s sake and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness to make Your servant know <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:22">&nbsp;7:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore You are great, O Lord Jehovah; for there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:23">&nbsp;7:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And who is like Your people Israel, a nation unique on the earth, whom God went to redeem to Himself as a people in order to make a name for Himself and to do for You what is great and awesome for Your land <I>and</I> before Your people, which You have redeemed to Yourself out of Egypt, <I>from</I> the nations and their gods?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:24">&nbsp;7:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And You have established Your people Israel to be a people to You forever, and You, O Jehovah, became their God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:25">&nbsp;7:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And now, O Jehovah God, confirm forever the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, and do as You have spoken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:26">&nbsp;7:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And may Your name be magnified forever when <I>men</I> say, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of Your servant David will be established before You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:27">&nbsp;7:27 &nbsp;</A></B> For You, O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to Your servant, saying, I will build you a house; therefore Your servant has found <I>it</I> in his heart to pray this prayer to You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:28">&nbsp;7:28 &nbsp;</A></B> And now, O Lord Jehovah, You are God, and Your words are true, and You have spoken this good matter to Your servant;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:29">&nbsp;7:29 &nbsp;</A></B> Now therefore may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You, O Lord Jehovah, have spoken <I>it.</I> And with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever.<BR>
