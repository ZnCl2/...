</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:1">10:1 &nbsp;</A></B> My soul loathes my own life; / I will let my complaint have free course in me; / I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:2">10:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I will say to God, Do not account me wicked; / Make known to me why You contend with me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:3">10:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Does it <I>seem</I> good to You to oppress, / To despise the toil of Your hands / And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:4">10:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Do You have eyes of flesh? / Or do You see as a man sees?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:5">10:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Are Your days like the days of a man, / Or Your years like the days of a mighty man,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:6">10:6 &nbsp;</A></B> That You would seek out my iniquity / And search for my sin,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:7">10:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Even though You know that I am not wicked / And that there is none who can deliver out of Your hand?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:8">10:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Your hands have shaped me and made me altogether, / Yet You destroy me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:9">10:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember now that You have made me like clay; / And will You return me to the dust?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:10">10:10&nbsp;</A></B> Have You not poured me out like milk / And curdled me like cheese?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:11">10:11&nbsp;</A></B> You have clothed me with skin and flesh / And woven me together with bones and sinews.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:12">10:12&nbsp;</A></B> You have granted me life and lovingkindness, / And Your visitation has preserved my spirit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:13">10:13&nbsp;</A></B> But You have hidden these things in Your heart; / I know that this is with You:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:14">10:14&nbsp;</A></B> If I sin, You mark me, / And You do not acquit me of my iniquity;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:15">10:15&nbsp;</A></B> If I am wicked, woe unto me; / If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head, / Being filled with dishonor and looking on my affliction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:16">10:16&nbsp;</A></B> And if my head should be lifted up, You would hunt me down like a lion, / And You would again demonstrate wonders on me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:17">10:17&nbsp;</A></B> You renew Your witnesses against me / And increase Your anger against me; / Attacking waves and a host are against me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:18">10:18&nbsp;</A></B> And why have You brought me out of the womb? / I should have died that no eye had seen me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:19">10:19&nbsp;</A></B> I should have been as though I had not been; / I should have been carried from birth to the grave.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:20">10:20&nbsp;</A></B> Are not my days few? Cease then, / And let me alone, that I may be somewhat revived,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:21">10:21&nbsp;</A></B> Before I go, and never return, / To the land of darkness and the shadow of death,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:22">10:22&nbsp;</A></B> The land of gloom like deep darkness, / The shadow of death without order, / Which shines like deep darkness.<BR>
