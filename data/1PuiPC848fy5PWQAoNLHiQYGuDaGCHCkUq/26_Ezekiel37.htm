</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:1">37:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The hand of Jehovah came upon me, and He brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:2">37:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And He caused me to pass all around among them, and there were very many on the surface of the valley, and they were also very dry.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:3">37:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, You know.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:4">37:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:5">37:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says the Lord Jehovah to these bones: I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:6">37:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will put sinews on you and bring flesh back on you and cover you with skin and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you will know that I am Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:7">37:7 &nbsp;</A></B> So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:8">37:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And I looked, and there were sinews on them, and flesh came back, and skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:9">37:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He said to me, Prophesy to the wind; prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:10">37:10&nbsp;</A></B> So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them; and they lived and stood up upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:11">37:11&nbsp;</A></B> Then He said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Now they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:12">37:12&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Now I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:13">37:13&nbsp;</A></B> And you will know that I am Jehovah, when I open your graves and bring you up out of your graves, O My people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:14">37:14&nbsp;</A></B> And I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live; and I will place you in your own land. Then you will know that I, Jehovah, have spoken and that I have performed <I>it,</I> declares Jehovah.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:15">37:15&nbsp;</A></B> The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:16">37:16&nbsp;</A></B> And you, son of man, take one piece of wood, and write upon it, For Judah and for the children of Israel associated with him; then take another piece of wood, and write upon it, For Joseph, the piece of wood of Ephraim, and <I>for</I> all the house of Israel associated with him;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:17">37:17&nbsp;</A></B> And bring them together, one <I>side</I> to the other, into one piece of wood, that they may become united in your hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:18">37:18&nbsp;</A></B> And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, Will you not tell us what you mean by these?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:19">37:19&nbsp;</A></B> Say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am about to take the piece of wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel associated with him; and I will put them upon it, that is, the piece of wood of Judah, and make them one piece of wood, and they will be one in My hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:20">37:20&nbsp;</A></B> And the pieces of wood on which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:21">37:21&nbsp;</A></B> And you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, I am about to take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they have gone, and I will gather them from all around and bring them into their own land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:22">37:22&nbsp;</A></B> And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel, and one king will be king to all of them; and they will no longer be two nations, nor will they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:23">37:23&nbsp;</A></B> They will not defile themselves any longer with their idols, or their detestable things, or any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them. Therefore they will be My people, and I will be their God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:24">37:24&nbsp;</A></B> And My Servant David will be King over them, and they all will have one Shepherd. They will also walk in My ordinances and observe My statutes and do them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:25">37:25&nbsp;</A></B> And they will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers dwelt; and they will dwell in it, they, their children, and their children’s children, forever. And David My Servant will be their Prince forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:26">37:26&nbsp;</A></B> I will also make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them <I>there</I> and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forever,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:27">37:27&nbsp;</A></B> And My tabernacle will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:28">37:28&nbsp;</A></B> Then the nations will know that I am Jehovah, who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary will be in their midst forever.<BR>
