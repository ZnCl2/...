</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Suffer evil with <I>me</I> as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted <I>him.</I><BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And also if anyone contends <I>in the games,</I> he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> The laboring farmer must be the first to partake of the fruit.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> In which I suffer evil unto bonds as a criminal; but the word of God is not bound.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they themselves also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Faithful is the word: For if we died with <I>Him,</I> we will also live with <I>Him;</I><BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> If we endure, we will also reign with <I>Him;</I> if we deny <I>Him,</I> He also will deny us;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Remind <I>them</I> of these things, solemnly charging <I>them</I> before God not to have contentions of words, <I>which is</I> useful for nothing, to the ruin of those who hear.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> But avoid profane, vain babblings, for they will advance to more ungodliness,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And their word will spread like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:18">&nbsp;2:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Who concerning the truth have misaimed, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:19">&nbsp;2:19 &nbsp;</A></B> However the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:20">&nbsp;2:20 &nbsp;</A></B> But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:21">&nbsp;2:21 &nbsp;</A></B> If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:22">&nbsp;2:22 &nbsp;</A></B> But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:23">&nbsp;2:23 &nbsp;</A></B> But foolish questionings and those arising from an untrained mind refuse, knowing that they beget contentions.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:24">&nbsp;2:24 &nbsp;</A></B> But a slave of the Lord ought not to contend but be gentle toward all, apt to teach, bearing with wrong;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:25">&nbsp;2:25 &nbsp;</A></B> In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:26">&nbsp;2:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And they may return to soberness out of the snare of the devil, having been caught alive by him, unto His will.<BR>
