</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:1">29:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, he alone whom God has chosen, is young and tender, and the work is great because the palace is not for man but for Jehovah God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:2">29:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And as much as was in my power I have prepared for the house of my God the gold for the <I>things of</I> gold and the silver for the <I>things of</I> silver and the bronze for the <I>things of</I> bronze and the iron for the <I>things of</I> iron and the wood for the <I>things of</I> wood, onyx stones and inlaid <I>stones,</I> stones of antimony and variegated stones, and every kind of precious stone and marble stones in abundance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:3">29:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Furthermore, because I set my affection on the house of my God, and since I have a private treasure of gold and silver, I give <I>it</I> for the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for this holy house:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:4">29:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Three thousand talents of gold, from the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the houses,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:5">29:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Gold for the <I>things of</I> gold and the silver for the <I>things of</I> silver and for all the work by the hands of the craftsmen. And who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Jehovah?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:6">29:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And the leaders of the fathers’ <I>houses</I> and the leaders of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the overseers of the king’s work offered willingly;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:7">29:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And they gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:8">29:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And those with whom gems were found gave <I>them</I> to the treasure of the house of Jehovah through Jehiel the Gershonite.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:9">29:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the people rejoiced because they offered willingly; for with <I>their</I> whole heart they offered willingly to Jehovah. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:10">29:10&nbsp;</A></B> And David blessed Jehovah in the sight of all the assembly. And David said, You are blessed, O Jehovah, God of Israel our Father, from eternity to eternity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:11">29:11&nbsp;</A></B> Yours is the greatness and the power and the splendor and the victory and the majesty, indeed all that is in heaven and on earth; Yours, O Jehovah, is the kingdom, and You are exalted as Head over all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:12">29:12&nbsp;</A></B> Both riches and glory <I>proceed</I> from You, and You rule over all. In Your hand are power and might, and it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:13">29:13&nbsp;</A></B> Now therefore, our God, we thank You and praise Your glorious name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:14">29:14&nbsp;</A></B> But who am I, and who are my people, that we should have strength to offer so willingly in this way? For all things are from You, and from Your hand we have given to You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:15">29:15&nbsp;</A></B> For we are strangers before You and sojourners, as were all our fathers; our days upon earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:16">29:16&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah our God, as for all this abundance that we have prepared for building You a house for Your holy name, it is from Your hand, and all is Yours.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:17">29:17&nbsp;</A></B> I know also, O my God, that You try the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. I, in the uprightness of my heart, have offered willingly all these things; and now I have seen with joy Your people, who are present here, offering willingly to You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:18">29:18&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of Your people’s heart and establish their heart toward You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:19">29:19&nbsp;</A></B> And to Solomon my son give a wholeness of heart to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do all and build the palace for which I have prepared <I>these things.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:20">29:20&nbsp;</A></B> Then David said to all the assembly, Bless Jehovah your God.<BR>

And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers; and they bowed down and paid homage to Jehovah and the king.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:21">29:21&nbsp;</A></B> And they offered sacrifices to Jehovah and offered up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the next day&nbsp;— one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:22">29:22&nbsp;</A></B> And they ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time and anointed him as ruler for Jehovah, and Zadok as priest.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:23">29:23&nbsp;</A></B> And Solomon sat upon the throne of Jehovah as king in place of David his father and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:24">29:24&nbsp;</A></B> And all the leaders and mighty men and also all the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:25">29:25&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him a royal majesty that had never been on any king before him over Israel.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:26">29:26&nbsp;</A></B> Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:27">29:27&nbsp;</A></B> And the time which he reigned over Israel was forty years; in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:28">29:28&nbsp;</A></B> And David died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:29">29:29&nbsp;</A></B> And the acts of David the king, the first and the last, are there written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer and in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the chronicles of Gad the seer,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:30">29:30&nbsp;</A></B> With all his reign and his might and the times that befell him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.<BR>
