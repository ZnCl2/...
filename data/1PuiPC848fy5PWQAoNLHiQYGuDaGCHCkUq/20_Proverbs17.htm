</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:1">17:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it / Than a house full of feasting with strife.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:2">17:2 &nbsp;</A></B> A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, / And will share in the inheritance among brothers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:3">17:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, / But Jehovah tries the hearts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:4">17:4 &nbsp;</A></B> An evildoer gives heed to wicked lips, / <I>And</I> a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:5">17:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker; / He who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:6">17:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Grandchildren are the crown of old men, / And the glory of children is their fathers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:7">17:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Excellent speech is not fitting for a fool; / Much less are lying lips for a noble man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:8">17:8 &nbsp;</A></B> A bribe is <I>like</I> a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor: / Wherever he turns, he prospers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:9">17:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He who covers a transgression seeks love, / But he who repeats a matter separates close friends.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:10">17:10&nbsp;</A></B> A rebuke strikes deeper into him who has understanding / Than a hundred stripes into a fool.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:11">17:11&nbsp;</A></B> An evil man seeks only rebellion; / Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:12">17:12&nbsp;</A></B> Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man / Rather than a fool in his folly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:13">17:13&nbsp;</A></B> Whoever rewards evil for good, / Evil will not depart from his house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:14">17:14&nbsp;</A></B> The beginning of contention is <I>like</I> letting out water; / Therefore abandon strife before it breaks out.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:15">17:15&nbsp;</A></B> He who justifies the wicked man, and he who condemns the righteous man, / Both of them are an abomination to Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:16">17:16&nbsp;</A></B> Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, / When he has no sense?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:17">17:17&nbsp;</A></B> A friend loves at all times, / And a brother is born for adversity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:18">17:18&nbsp;</A></B> A man lacking sense gives his hand as a pledge / And becomes surety in the presence of his neighbor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:19">17:19&nbsp;</A></B> He who loves transgression loves strife; / He who raises high his entrance seeks destruction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:20">17:20&nbsp;</A></B> He who has a crooked heart finds no good, / And he who has a perverse tongue falls into evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:21">17:21&nbsp;</A></B> He who begets a fool <I>does so</I> to his sorrow, / And the father of a fool has no joy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:22">17:22&nbsp;</A></B> A joyful heart is good medicine, / But a broken spirit dries up the bones.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:23">17:23&nbsp;</A></B> A wicked man receives a bribe from the bosom, / To pervert the ways of justice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:24">17:24&nbsp;</A></B> Wisdom is before the face of him who has understanding, / But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:25">17:25&nbsp;</A></B> A foolish son is a grief to his father, / And bitterness to her who bore him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:26">17:26&nbsp;</A></B> To also punish the righteous man is not good, / <I>Nor</I> to strike nobles for <I>their</I> uprightness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:27">17:27&nbsp;</A></B> He who restrains his words has knowledge, / And he who is cool in spirit is one who has understanding.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="17:28">17:28&nbsp;</A></B> Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise; / When he shuts his lips, he is <I>counted</I> prudent.<BR>
