</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:1">29:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job again took up his discourse and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:2">29:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Oh that I were as in the months of old, / As in the days when God watched over me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:3">29:3 &nbsp;</A></B> When His lamp shone over my head, / <I>And</I> by His light I walked through darkness;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:4">29:4 &nbsp;</A></B> As I was in the days of my prime, / When intimate counsel with God was over my tent;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:5">29:5 &nbsp;</A></B> When the Almighty was yet with me, / <I>And</I> my children were around me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:6">29:6 &nbsp;</A></B> When my steps were bathed in milk, / And the rock poured out for me streams of oil!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:7">29:7 &nbsp;</A></B> When I went out to the gate of the city, / When I prepared my seat in the square,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:8">29:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The young men saw me and hid themselves, / And the aged rose up <I>and</I> stood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:9">29:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Princes refrained from talking / And laid <I>their</I> hand over their mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:10">29:10&nbsp;</A></B> The voice of the nobles was hushed, / And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:11">29:11&nbsp;</A></B> For when the ear heard <I>me,</I> it blessed me; / And when the eye saw <I>me,</I> it bore witness to me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:12">29:12&nbsp;</A></B> Because I delivered the poor man who cried out, / And the orphan who had no one to help him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:13">29:13&nbsp;</A></B> The blessing of him who was perishing came upon me, / And I made the widow’s heart shout for joy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:14">29:14&nbsp;</A></B> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; / My justice was like a robe and a turban.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:15">29:15&nbsp;</A></B> I was eyes to the blind, / And I was feet to the lame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:16">29:16&nbsp;</A></B> I was a father to the needy, / And the cause of him whom I did not know I investigated.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:17">29:17&nbsp;</A></B> I broke the jaws of the unjust / And made him drop the prey from his teeth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:18">29:18&nbsp;</A></B> Then I said, I will die in my nest, / And I will multiply <I>my</I> days like the sand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:19">29:19&nbsp;</A></B> My root is spread out to the water, / And dew abides on my branch at night.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:20">29:20&nbsp;</A></B> My glory is <I>always</I> new with me, / And my bow is renewed in my hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:21">29:21&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Men</I> listened to me and waited, / And they were silent for my counsel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:22">29:22&nbsp;</A></B> After my words they spoke not again, / And my speech distilled <I>like</I> <I>dew</I> upon them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:23">29:23&nbsp;</A></B> And they waited for me as for the rain, / And they opened their mouth wide <I>as</I> for the late rain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:24">29:24&nbsp;</A></B> I smiled on them&nbsp;— they could not believe <I>it;</I> / And they did not cast down the light of my countenance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="29:25">29:25&nbsp;</A></B> I chose the way for them and sat as chief, / And I dwelt as a king among the troops, / As one who comforts those who mourn.<BR>
