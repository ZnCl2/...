</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> How the city sits alone / That was full of people! / She who was <I>once</I> great among the nations / Has become like a widow; / She who was a princess among the provinces / Has become tributary.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Bitterly she weeps in the night, / And her tears are on her cheeks. / There is no one to comfort her / Among all her lovers; / All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; / They have become her enemies.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Judah has gone into exile, away from affliction / And away from great servitude; / She dwells among the nations / <I>But</I> finds no rest; / All her pursuers have overtaken her / In the midst of distress.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The ways of Zion mourn, / For no one comes to the appointed feast; / All her gates are desolate; / Her priests groan; / Her virgins are afflicted, / And she is in bitterness.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Her adversaries have become the head; / Her enemies prosper; / For Jehovah has afflicted her / Because of the multitude of her transgressions; / Her little ones have gone into captivity / Before the adversary.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And all her majesty has departed / From the daughter of Zion; / Her princes have become like deer / That find no pasture, / And they have fled without strength / Before the pursuer.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> In the days of her affliction and her wanderings, / Jerusalem remembers / All her precious things / Which were in the days of old, / When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, / And there was no one to help her. / The adversaries saw her; / They mocked at her downfall.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Jerusalem has sinned grievously; / Therefore she has become an impurity. / All who honored her despise her, / Because they have seen her nakedness; / And she groans / And turns backwards.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Her uncleanness is in her skirts; / She did not remember her latter end; / Therefore she has come down astonishingly; / There is no one to comfort her. / O Jehovah, see my affliction, / For the enemy has magnified himself.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> The adversary has spread out his hand / Over all her precious things, / For she has seen the nations / Enter her sanctuary, / <I>Concerning</I> whom You commanded that they should not enter / Into Your assembly.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> All her people groan; / They seek bread;<BR> 
They have given their precious things for food / To restore their soul. / See, O Jehovah, and look, / For I have become despised.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Is it nothing to you, all who pass by the way? / Look and see / If there is any pain like my pain / Which is dealt to me, / Whom Jehovah has afflicted / In the day of His burning anger.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> He has sent fire from on high / Into my bones, and it prevails <I>against them;</I> / He has spread out a net for my feet; / He has turned me back; / He has made me a desolation / <I>And</I> faint all the day.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand; / They are knit together; / They have come up upon my neck; / He has made my strength fail; / The Lord has delivered me into hands / From which I am not able to rise up.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord has made light of all my mighty men / In my midst; / He has called an assembly against me / To crush my young men. / The Lord has trodden, <I>as in</I> a winepress, / The virgin daughter of Judah.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> For these things I weep; / My eye, my eye runs down with water, / For the comforter who should revive my soul / Is far from me; / My children have become desolate, / Because the enemy has prevailed.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Zion stretches out her hands, / <I>Yet</I> there is no one to comfort her. / Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob / That those around him should be his adversaries; / Jerusalem has become an impurity / Among them.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:18">&nbsp;1:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah is righteous, / For I have rebelled against His commandment. / Hear now, all the peoples, / And see my pain; / My virgins and my young men / Have gone into captivity.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:19">&nbsp;1:19 &nbsp;</A></B> I have called to my lovers; / They have deceived me; / My priests and my elders / Have perished in the city, / While they sought food for themselves / To restore their souls.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:20">&nbsp;1:20 &nbsp;</A></B> See, O Jehovah, for I am in distress, / My bowels are in ferment; / My heart is overturned within me, / For I have been very rebellious. / In the street the sword bereaves; / In the house it is like death.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:21">&nbsp;1:21 &nbsp;</A></B> They have heard that I groan; / There is no one to comfort me; / All my enemies have heard of my trouble; / They are glad that You have done <I>it.</I> / You will bring the day that You have proclaimed, / And they will be like me.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:22">&nbsp;1:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Let all their wickedness come before You, / And deal with them / As You have dealt with me / For all my transgressions; / For my sighs are many, / And my heart is faint.<BR>
