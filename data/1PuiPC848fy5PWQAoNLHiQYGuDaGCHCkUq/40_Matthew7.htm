</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not judge, that you be not judged.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the splinter from your eye, and behold, the beam is in your eye?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother’s eye.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks him for a loaf, will give him a stone?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Or also when he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> If you then being evil know <I>how</I> to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore all that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> By their fruits you will recognize them. Do <I>men</I> gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Even so every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:18">&nbsp;7:18 &nbsp;</A></B> A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:19">&nbsp;7:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:20">&nbsp;7:20 &nbsp;</A></B> So then, by their fruits you will recognize them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:21">&nbsp;7:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:22">&nbsp;7:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, <I>was it</I> not in Your name <I>that</I> we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:23">&nbsp;7:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:24">&nbsp;7:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Everyone therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the rock.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:25">&nbsp;7:25 &nbsp;</A></B> And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:26">&nbsp;7:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:27">&nbsp;7:27 &nbsp;</A></B> And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they dashed against that house; and it fell, and its fall was great.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:28">&nbsp;7:28 &nbsp;</A></B> And when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astounded at His teaching,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:29">&nbsp;7:29 &nbsp;</A></B> For He taught them as One having authority and not like their scribes.<BR>
