</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:1">14:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And in Iconium they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:2">14:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up and ill-affected the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:3">14:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore they spent a considerable amount of time speaking with boldness in the Lord, who testified to the word of His grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:4">14:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:5">14:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And when a hostile attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat <I>the apostles</I> outrageously and to stone them,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:6">14:6 &nbsp;</A></B> They became aware of <I>it</I> and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:7">14:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And there they announced the gospel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:8">14:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And in Lystra a certain man was sitting, without strength in his feet, lame from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:9">14:9 &nbsp;</A></B> This man heard Paul speaking, who, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:10">14:10&nbsp;</A></B> Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped up and began to walk.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:11">14:11&nbsp;</A></B> And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have become like men and have come down to us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:12">14:12&nbsp;</A></B> And they called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the one who took the lead in the discourse.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:13">14:13&nbsp;</A></B> And the priest of Zeus, whose <I>temple</I> was before the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer a sacrifice with the crowds.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:14">14:14&nbsp;</A></B> But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard <I>this,</I> they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:15">14:15&nbsp;</A></B> And saying, Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like feeling as you, <I>and</I> announce the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:16">14:16&nbsp;</A></B> Who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to go their ways.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:17">14:17&nbsp;</A></B> And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:18">14:18&nbsp;</A></B> And saying these things, they restrained the crowds <I>only</I> with difficulty from offering sacrifices to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:19">14:19&nbsp;</A></B> But Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged <I>him</I> outside the city, supposing that he was dead.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:20">14:20&nbsp;</A></B> But as the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city. And on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:21">14:21&nbsp;</A></B> And when they had announced the gospel to that city and had made a considerable number of disciples,<BR>

they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:22">14:22&nbsp;</A></B> Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting <I>them</I> to continue in the faith and <I>saying</I> that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:23">14:23&nbsp;</A></B> And when they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord into whom they had believed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:24">14:24&nbsp;</A></B> And they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:25">14:25&nbsp;</A></B> And when they had spoken the word in Perga,<BR>

they came down to Attalia.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:26">14:26&nbsp;</A></B> And from there they sailed away to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:27">14:27&nbsp;</A></B> And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared the things that God had done with them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:28">14:28&nbsp;</A></B> And they spent no little time <I>there</I> with the disciples.<BR>
