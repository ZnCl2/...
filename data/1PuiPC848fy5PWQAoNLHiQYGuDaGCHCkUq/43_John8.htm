</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:1">&nbsp;8:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:2">&nbsp;8:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:3">&nbsp;8:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the midst,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:4">&nbsp;8:4 &nbsp;</A></B> They said to Him, Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery, in the very act.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:5">&nbsp;8:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do You say?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:6">&nbsp;8:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But they said this to tempt Him, so that they might have <I>reason</I> to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:7">&nbsp;8:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him <I>be the</I> first to throw a stone at her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:8">&nbsp;8:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:9">&nbsp;8:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And when they heard <I>that,</I> they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman <I>stood</I> where she was, in the midst.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:10">&nbsp;8:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:11">&nbsp;8:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:12">&nbsp;8:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:13">&nbsp;8:13 &nbsp;</A></B> The Pharisees then said to Him, You are testifying concerning Yourself; Your testimony is not true.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:14">&nbsp;8:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:15">&nbsp;8:15 &nbsp;</A></B> You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:16">&nbsp;8:16 &nbsp;</A></B> But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:17">&nbsp;8:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And in your law also it has been written that the testimony of two men is true:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:18">&nbsp;8:18 &nbsp;</A></B> I am One who testifies concerning Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies concerning Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:19">&nbsp;8:19 &nbsp;</A></B> They said then to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:20">&nbsp;8:20 &nbsp;</A></B> These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:21">&nbsp;8:21 &nbsp;</A></B> He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:22">&nbsp;8:22 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:23">&nbsp;8:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:24">&nbsp;8:24 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:25">&nbsp;8:25 &nbsp;</A></B> They said then to Him, Who are You? Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also tell you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:26">&nbsp;8:26 &nbsp;</A></B> I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:27">&nbsp;8:27 &nbsp;</A></B> They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:28">&nbsp;8:28 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and <I>that</I> I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:29">&nbsp;8:29 &nbsp;</A></B> And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:30">&nbsp;8:30 &nbsp;</A></B> As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:31">&nbsp;8:31 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:32">&nbsp;8:32 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:33">&nbsp;8:33 &nbsp;</A></B> They answered Him, We are Abraham’s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How <I>is it that</I> You say, You shall become free?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:34">&nbsp;8:34 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:35">&nbsp;8:35 &nbsp;</A></B> And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:36">&nbsp;8:36 &nbsp;</A></B> If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:37">&nbsp;8:37 &nbsp;</A></B> I know that you are Abraham’s seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:38">&nbsp;8:38 &nbsp;</A></B> I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:39">&nbsp;8:39 &nbsp;</A></B> They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:40">&nbsp;8:40 &nbsp;</A></B> But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:41">&nbsp;8:41 &nbsp;</A></B> You do the works of your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:42">&nbsp;8:42 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come <I>from Him;</I> for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:43">&nbsp;8:43 &nbsp;</A></B> Why do you not understand My speaking? <I>It is</I> because you cannot hear My word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:44">&nbsp;8:44 &nbsp;</A></B> You are of <I>your</I> father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks <I>it</I> out of his own <I>possessions;</I> for he is a liar and the father of it.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:45">&nbsp;8:45 &nbsp;</A></B> But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:46">&nbsp;8:46 &nbsp;</A></B> Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:47">&nbsp;8:47 &nbsp;</A></B> He who is of God hears the words of God; for this <I>reason</I> you do not hear <I>them,</I> because you are not of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:48">&nbsp;8:48 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well <I>in saying</I> that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:49">&nbsp;8:49 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:50">&nbsp;8:50 &nbsp;</A></B> But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks <I>glory for Me</I> and judges.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:51">&nbsp;8:51 &nbsp;</A></B> Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:52">&nbsp;8:52 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets <I>too;</I> yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:53">&nbsp;8:53 &nbsp;</A></B> Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Who are You making Yourself?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:54">&nbsp;8:54 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:55">&nbsp;8:55 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:56">&nbsp;8:56 &nbsp;</A></B> Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw <I>it</I> and rejoiced.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:57">&nbsp;8:57 &nbsp;</A></B> The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:58">&nbsp;8:58 &nbsp;</A></B> Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:59">&nbsp;8:59 &nbsp;</A></B> So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple.<BR>
