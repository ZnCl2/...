</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:3">50:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Our God has come and will not be silent; / Fire devours before Him, / And around Him it is exceedingly tempestuous.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:4">50:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He calls to the heavens above, / And to the earth that He may judge His people:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:5">50:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Gather My saints to Me, / Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:6">50:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the heavens declare His righteousness, / For God Himself is Judge. Selah<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:7">50:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear, O My people, and I will speak; / O Israel, and I will testify against you: / I am God, your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:8">50:8 &nbsp;</A></B> I will not reprove you because of your sacrifices, / And your burnt offerings are before Me continually.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:9">50:9 &nbsp;</A></B> I will not take a bull from your house / <I>Nor</I> goats from your folds,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:10">50:10&nbsp;</A></B> For every animal of the forest is Mine, / The cattle upon a thousand hills.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:11">50:11&nbsp;</A></B> I know every bird of the mountains, / And I am aware of everything that moves in the field.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:12">50:12&nbsp;</A></B> If I were hungry, I would not tell you; / For the world is Mine and the fullness thereof.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:13">50:13&nbsp;</A></B> Shall I eat the flesh of bulls / Or drink the blood of goats?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:14">50:14&nbsp;</A></B> Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, / And repay your vows to the Most High;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:15">50:15&nbsp;</A></B> And call upon Me in the day of trouble: / I will deliver you, and you will glorify Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:16">50:16&nbsp;</A></B> But to the wicked God says, / What <I>right</I> do you have to declare My statutes / And take up My covenant in your mouth,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:17">50:17&nbsp;</A></B> Seeing that you hate correction / And cast My words behind you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:18">50:18&nbsp;</A></B> When you see a thief, you take pleasure in him; / And your portion is with adulterers.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:20">50:20&nbsp;</A></B> You sit <I>and</I> speak against your brother; / You defame the son of your mother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:21">50:21&nbsp;</A></B> These things you do, and I keep silent; / You think that I am altogether like you. / I will rebuke you and set forth <I>the matter</I> in order before your eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="50:22">50:22&nbsp;</A></B> Consider this then, you who forget God, / Lest I tear <I>you</I> apart and there be none to deliver <I>you.</I><BR>
