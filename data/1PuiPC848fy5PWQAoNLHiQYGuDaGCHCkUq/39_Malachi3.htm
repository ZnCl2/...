</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I am about to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me; and suddenly the Lord, whom you seek, will come to His temple. And the Angel of the covenant, whom you desire, He will come, says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And who will endure the day of His coming? And who will stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold and like silver, and they will offer to Jehovah a sacrifice in righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And the sacrifice of Judah and of Jerusalem will be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of old and as in the former years.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely and against those who oppress the hired worker for his hire, <I>and</I> the widow and the orphan, and those who turn the stranger aside, and who do not fear Me, says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For I, Jehovah, do not change; therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept <I>them.</I> Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts. But you say, How shall we return?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me. But you say, How have we robbed You? In tithes and offerings.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> With the curse you are cursed, yet you, <I>even</I> the whole nation, rob Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sake, and for your sake he will not destroy the fruit of the ground; and for your sake the vine will not lose its fruit in the field, says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Your words have been strongly against Me, says Jehovah; but you say, What have we spoken against You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> You say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge and have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And now we call the arrogant blessed; not only have those who act wickedly been built up, but they also try God and escape.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Then those who feared Jehovah spoke to one another, each with his neighbor. And Jehovah gave heed and listened, and a book of remembrance was written before Him of those who feared Jehovah and considered His name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And they will be Mine, says Jehovah of hosts, a personal treasure, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them, as a man spares his son who serves him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And you will return and discern between him who is righteous and him who is wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him.<BR>
