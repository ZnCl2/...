</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:1">15:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:2">15:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every <I>branch</I> that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:3">15:3 &nbsp;</A></B> You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:4">15:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither <I>can</I> you unless you abide in Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:5">15:5 &nbsp;</A></B> I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:6">15:6 &nbsp;</A></B> If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast <I>them</I> into the fire, and they are burned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:7">15:7 &nbsp;</A></B> If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:8">15:8 &nbsp;</A></B> In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and <I>so</I> you will become My disciples.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:9">15:9 &nbsp;</A></B> As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:10">15:10&nbsp;</A></B> If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:11">15:11&nbsp;</A></B> These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and <I>that</I> your joy may be made full.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:12">15:12&nbsp;</A></B> This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:13">15:13&nbsp;</A></B> No one has greater love than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:14">15:14&nbsp;</A></B> You are My friends if you do what I command you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:15">15:15&nbsp;</A></B> No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:16">15:16&nbsp;</A></B> You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and <I>that</I> your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:17">15:17&nbsp;</A></B> These things I command you that you may love one another.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:18">15:18&nbsp;</A></B> If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:19">15:19&nbsp;</A></B> If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:20">15:20&nbsp;</A></B> Remember the word which I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will persecute you also; if they have kept My word, they will keep yours also.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:21">15:21&nbsp;</A></B> But all these things they will do to you because of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:22">15:22&nbsp;</A></B> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:23">15:23&nbsp;</A></B> He who hates Me hates My Father also.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:24">15:24&nbsp;</A></B> If I did not do among them the works which no one else has done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:25">15:25&nbsp;</A></B> But <I>it is so</I> that the word written in their law may be fulfilled, “They hated Me without cause.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:26">15:26&nbsp;</A></B> But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="15:27">15:27&nbsp;</A></B> And you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me.<BR>
