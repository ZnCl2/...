</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:1">139:1 &nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, You have searched me and known <I>me.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:2">139:2 &nbsp;</A></B>  You know when I sit down and when I rise up; / You understand my thoughts from afar.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:3">139:3 &nbsp;</A></B> You thoroughly search my path and my lying down, / And You are acquainted with all my ways.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:4">139:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For a word is not <I>yet</I> on my tongue, / <I>And</I> already You, O Jehovah, know it completely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:5">139:5 &nbsp;</A></B> You have closed in on me behind and before / And have laid Your hand on me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:6">139:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Oh, knowledge too wonderful for me! / It is so high; I cannot attain to it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:7">139:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Where shall I go, away from Your Spirit, / And where shall I flee from Your presence?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:8">139:8 &nbsp;</A></B> If I ascend into heaven, You are there; / If I make my bed in Sheol, there You are.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:9">139:9 &nbsp;</A></B> If I take the wings of the dawn / <I>And</I> settle at the limits of the sea,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:10">139:10&nbsp;</A></B> There also Your hand will lead me, / And Your right hand will take hold of me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:11">139:11&nbsp;</A></B> And if I say, Surely darkness will cover me, / And the light around me will be night;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:12">139:12&nbsp;</A></B> Even the darkness is not dark to You, / And night shines like day; / The darkness is like the light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:13">139:13&nbsp;</A></B> For it was You who formed my inward parts; / You wove me together in my mother’s womb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:14">139:14&nbsp;</A></B> I will praise You, for I am awesomely and wonderfully made; / Your works are wonderful, / And my soul knows <I>it</I> well.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:15">139:15&nbsp;</A></B> My frame was not hidden from You / When I was made in secret, / Skillfully fashioned in the depths of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:16">139:16&nbsp;</A></B> Your eyes saw my unformed substance; / And in Your book all of them were written: / The days that were ordained <I>for me,</I> / When not one of them was yet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:17">139:17&nbsp;</A></B> And how precious are Your thoughts to me, O God! / How great is the sum of them!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:18">139:18&nbsp;</A></B> If I should count them, they would be more than the sand. / When I awake, I am still with You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:19">139:19&nbsp;</A></B> Oh that You, O God, would slay the wicked&nbsp;— / Depart from me therefore, you men of bloodshed&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:20">139:20&nbsp;</A></B> Those who speak of You with evil intent, / Who as Your enemies take <I>Your name</I> in vain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:21">139:21&nbsp;</A></B> Do I not hate those who hate You, O Jehovah? / And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:22">139:22&nbsp;</A></B> I hate them with a perfect hatred; / They have become my own enemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:23">139:23&nbsp;</A></B> Search me, O God, and know my heart; / Try me, and know my anxious thoughts;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="139:24">139:24&nbsp;</A></B> And see if there is some harmful way in me, / And lead me on the eternal way.<BR>
