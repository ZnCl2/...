</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> A good name is better than precious ointment, / And the day of death, than the day of one’s birth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> It is better to go to the house of mourning / Than to go to the house of feasting, / Because that is the end of every man, / And the living takes it to heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Sorrow is better than laughter, / For by the sadness of face the heart is made good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, / But the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> It is better <I>for one</I> to hear the rebuke of a wise man / Than for one to hear the song of fools.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, / So is the laughter of fools. / This also is vanity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Surely oppression makes a wise man mad, / And a bribe destroys the heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Better is the end of a thing than its beginning; / Better is patience of spirit than haughtiness of spirit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be quick in your spirit to become angry, / For anger rests in the bosom of fools.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not say, How is it that the former days were better than these? / For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, / And an advantage to those who see the sun.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For wisdom is a defense, as money is a defense; / But the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of those / who have it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Consider the work of God, / For who can straighten what He has made crooked?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> In the day of prosperity be joyful, / And in the day of adversity consider. / God has made the one as well as the other, / So that man may not find out anything about what is after him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> I have seen everything in my days of vanity: There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs <I>his life</I> in his wickedness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be overly righteous, and do not be overly wise; why should you destroy yourself?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be overly wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die when it is not your time?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:18">&nbsp;7:18 &nbsp;</A></B> It is better for you to take hold of the one without letting go of the other, for he who fears God will come out <I>of it</I> with them all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:19">&nbsp;7:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Wisdom strengthens the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:20">&nbsp;7:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Surely there is not a righteous man on the earth who does good and does not sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:21">&nbsp;7:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Also, do not give heed to all words spoken, lest you hear your servant cursing you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:22">&nbsp;7:22 &nbsp;</A></B> For your heart knows that many times you yourself have cursed others also.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:23">&nbsp;7:23 &nbsp;</A></B> All this I have tested by wisdom; I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:24">&nbsp;7:24 &nbsp;</A></B> That which is, is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:25">&nbsp;7:25 &nbsp;</A></B> I turned and my heart <I>was set</I> to know and to search and seek out wisdom and the sum <I>of things,</I> and to know that wickedness is folly and that foolishness is madness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:26">&nbsp;7:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is traps and snares, whose hands are fetters. One who is well-pleasing to God escapes from her, but the sinner is taken by her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:27">&nbsp;7:27 &nbsp;</A></B> See, this is what I have found, says the Preacher, <I>adding</I> one thing to another to find the sum,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:28">&nbsp;7:28 &nbsp;</A></B> Which my soul is still seeking but has not found. One man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all these I have not found.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:29">&nbsp;7:29 &nbsp;</A></B> See, this alone have I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.<BR>
