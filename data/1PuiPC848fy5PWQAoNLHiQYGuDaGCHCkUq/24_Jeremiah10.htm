</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:1">10:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear the word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:2">10:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / Do not learn the way of the nations, / And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens, / Although the nations are terrified by them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:3">10:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For the customs of the peoples are vanity, / Because <I>their god is</I> a tree cut from the forest, / The work of the hands of a craftsman with an ax.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:4">10:4 &nbsp;</A></B> He adorns it with silver and with gold; / They fasten it with nails and hammers / So that it cannot totter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:5">10:5 &nbsp;</A></B> They are like a post in a cucumber field, / And they cannot speak; / They must be carried / Because they cannot walk. / Do not be afraid of them, / For they cannot do evil, / And neither is it in them to do good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:6">10:6 &nbsp;</A></B> There is none like You, O Jehovah; / You are great, / And Your name is great in might.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:7">10:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Who would not fear You, / O King of the nations? / For it befits You, / For among all the wise of the nations / And in all their kingdoms / There is none like You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:8">10:8 &nbsp;</A></B> But they are altogether stupid and foolish; / The instruction of <I>their</I> idols is <I>mere</I> wood.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:9">10:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Beaten silver / Is brought from Tarshish, / And gold from Uphaz, / The work of a craftsman / And of the hands of a goldsmith. / Their clothing is blue and purple; / All of them are the work of skillful men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:10">10:10&nbsp;</A></B> But Jehovah is the true God; / He is the living God and the eternal King. / At His wrath the earth quakes, / And the nations cannot endure His indignation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:11">10:11&nbsp;</A></B> Thus you shall say to them, The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth, these will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:12">10:12&nbsp;</A></B> It is He who made the earth by His power, / Who established the world by His wisdom, / And by His understanding He stretched out the heavens.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:13">10:13&nbsp;</A></B> When He utters His voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, / And He causes the vapors to rise from the ends of the earth; / He makes lightning for the rain / And brings forth wind from His treasuries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:14">10:14&nbsp;</A></B> Every man is stupid, without knowledge; / Every goldsmith is put to shame by <I>his</I> idol; / For his molten image is falsehood, / And there is no breath in them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:15">10:15&nbsp;</A></B> They are vanity, the work of delusion; / At the time of their punishment they will perish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:16">10:16&nbsp;</A></B> The Portion of Jacob is not like these; / For He is the One who formed everything, / And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; / Jehovah of hosts is His name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:17">10:17&nbsp;</A></B> Gather up your bundle from the ground, / O inhabitant under siege.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:18">10:18&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / I will sling out / The inhabitants of the land / At this time, / And I will bring distress on them, / That they may find <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:19">10:19&nbsp;</A></B> Woe is me because of my hurt! / My wound is grievous. / But I said, Truly this is <I>my</I> affliction, / And I must bear it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:20">10:20&nbsp;</A></B> My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken; / My children have gone from me and they are not; / There is no one who will spread out my tent again / And set up my curtains.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:21">10:21&nbsp;</A></B> For the shepherds are stupid / And have not sought Jehovah; / Therefore they have not prospered, / And all their flock is scattered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:22">10:22&nbsp;</A></B> The sound of a report! Here it comes, / Even a great commotion from the land of the north, / To make the cities of Judah / A desolation, a habitation of jackals.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:23">10:23&nbsp;</A></B> I know, O Jehovah, / That a man’s way is not in himself; / It is not in the man who walks / To direct his step.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:24">10:24&nbsp;</A></B> Correct me, O Jehovah, but in measure, / Not in Your anger lest You bring me to nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="10:25">10:25&nbsp;</A></B> Pour out Your wrath on the nations / Who do not know You / And upon the families / Who do not call upon Your name; / For they have devoured Jacob, yes, devoured him and brought him to an end, / And they have desolated his habitation.<BR>
