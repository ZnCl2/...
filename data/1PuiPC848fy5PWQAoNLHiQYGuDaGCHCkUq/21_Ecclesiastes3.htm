</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> For everything there is a season, / And a time for every purpose under heaven:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> A time to be born, and a time to die; / A time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> A time to kill, and a time to heal; / A time to tear down, and a time to build up;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; / A time to mourn, and a time to dance;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; / A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> A time to seek, and a time to lose; / A time to keep, and a time to throw away;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> A time to tear, and a time to sew; / A time to be silent, and a time to speak;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> A time to love, and a time to hate; / A time for war, and a time for peace.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> What profit does the worker have in all that he labors?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> I have seen the travail that God has given the children of men to travail in.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> He has made everything beautiful in its own time; also He has put eternity in their heart, yet so that man does not find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and do good in their lifetime;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Moreover, that every man should eat and drink and taste enjoyment in all his labor; it is the gift of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> I know that whatever God does, it will be forever; nothing can be added to it, nor can anything be taken from it. God has <I>so</I> done, that <I>all</I> would fear Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> That which is has already been, and that which will be has already been; and God seeks what has passed.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Moreover I saw under the sun <I>that</I> in the place of judgment, wickedness is there; and in the place of righteousness, wickedness is there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and every work.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> I said in my heart, <I>This is so</I> for the sake of the children of men, that God may prove them and that they may see for themselves that they are but beasts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> For what happens to the children of men happens also to beasts; even the same thing happens to them <I>both:</I> As the one dies, so dies the other; and they all have one breath; and man has no advantage over the beast; for all is vanity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:20">&nbsp;3:20 &nbsp;</A></B> All go to one place: all are of dust, and all return to dust.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:21">&nbsp;3:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Who knows the breath of the children of men, that it goes upward; or the breath of the beasts, that it goes downward to the earth?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:22">&nbsp;3:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I saw that there is nothing better than that <I>a man</I> should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion. For who will bring him to see what will be after him?<BR>
