</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> For if I cause you sorrow, who then is the one who makes me glad, except the one who is made sorrowful by me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And I wrote this very thing <I>to you</I> that when I come I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, having confidence in you all that my joy is <I>the joy</I> of you all.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me to sorrow, but in part (lest I lay <I>too heavy</I> a burden) all of you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort <I>him,</I> lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I exhort you to confirm <I>your</I> love toward him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For to this end also I wrote, that I might know your approvedness, whether you are obedient in all things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> But whom you forgive anything, I also <I>forgive;</I> for also what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, <I>it is</I> for your sake in the person of Christ;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was open to me in the Lord,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> I had no rest in my spirit, for I did not find Titus my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> To some a savor out of death unto death, and to the others a savor out of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> For we are not like the many, adulterating the word of God for profit; but as out of sincerity, but as out of God, before God we speak in Christ.<BR>
