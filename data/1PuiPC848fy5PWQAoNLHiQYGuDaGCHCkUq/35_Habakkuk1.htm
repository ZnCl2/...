</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> How long, O Jehovah, shall I cry / And You do not hear? / I cry out to You, Violence! / And You do not save.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Why do You cause me to see iniquity / And look upon wrong? / Indeed destruction and violence are before me; / And there is strife, and contention arises.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore the law is ineffective, / And justice never goes forth; / For the wicked encompasses the righteous, / Therefore justice goes forth perverted.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Look among the nations, and see, / And be amazed, utterly amazed. / For I am doing a work in your days / <I>Which</I> you would not believe if it were told <I>you.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For I am about to raise up the Chaldeans, / That bitter and hasty nation / That marches through the breadth of the earth / To possess habitations that are not theirs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> They are terrible and dreadful; / Their judgment and their authority issue from themselves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And their horses are swifter than leopards / And more agile than the wolves of evening. / And their horsemen prance about; / Indeed their horsemen come from afar; / They fly like an eagle that hastens to devour.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> All of them come to do violence; / The set of their faces is forward, / And they gather captives like sand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed they scoff at kings, / And potentates are a derision to them; / They deride every fortress, / For they heap up dirt and take it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Then they will sweep through <I>like</I> the wind and pass over / And thus become guilty; this&nbsp;— their strength&nbsp;— is their god.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Are You not from everlasting, O Jehovah, / My God, my Holy One? We will not die. / O Jehovah, You have appointed them for judgment; / And You, O Rock, have established them for correction.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> You who are of purer eyes than to behold evil / And who cannot look upon wrong, / Why do You look upon them who deal treacherously / <I>And</I> keep silent when the wicked man swallows up him who is more / righteous than he?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And You make man like the fish of the sea, / Like the creeping things, who have no one to rule for them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:15">&nbsp;1:15 &nbsp;</A></B> They take all of them up with a hook; / They drag them off in their net / And gather them into their seine; / So they rejoice and exult.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:16">&nbsp;1:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore they offer sacrifices to their net / And burn incense to their seine, / For by them their portion is fat / And their food is plenteous.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:17">&nbsp;1:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Will they then empty their net / And continually slay the nations without sparing?<BR>
