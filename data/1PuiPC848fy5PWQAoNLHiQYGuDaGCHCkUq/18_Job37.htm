</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:5">37:5 &nbsp;</A></B> God thunders wondrously with His voice; / He does great things that we cannot comprehend.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="37:6">37:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth, / And to the rain shower and His mighty showers of rain.<BR>
