</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:1">&nbsp;7:1 &nbsp;</A></B> After He completed all His words in the hearing of the people, He entered into Capernaum.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:2">&nbsp;7:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And a certain centurion’s slave, who was highly valued by him, was ill and about to die.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:3">&nbsp;7:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And when he heard about Jesus, he sent to Him some elders of the Jews, requesting that He would come and completely heal his slave.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And when they came to Jesus, they entreated Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy of Your granting this <I>to him,</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For he loves our nation, and he himself built the synagogue for us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:6">&nbsp;7:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus went with them. But already, when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not fit for You to enter under my roof;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:7">&nbsp;7:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore, I did not count even myself worthy to come to You. But speak a word, and let my servant be healed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:8">&nbsp;7:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does <I>it</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And when Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such great faith.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:10">&nbsp;7:10 &nbsp;</A></B> And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And soon afterward He went into a city called Nain, and His disciples went with Him, as well as a large crowd.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:12">&nbsp;7:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And as He came near the gate of the city, behold, one who had died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a considerable crowd from the city was with her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the Lord saw her, He was moved with compassion for her and said to her, Do not weep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And He came near and touched the bier, and those carrying <I>it</I> stood still. And He said, Young man, to you I say, Arise.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And the dead man sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised up among us, and, God has visited His people!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:17">&nbsp;7:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And this report concerning Him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:18">&nbsp;7:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And John’s disciples reported to him concerning all these things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:19">&nbsp;7:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And John called a certain two of his disciples to <I>him</I> and sent <I>them</I> to the Lord, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:20">&nbsp;7:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And the men came to Him and said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:21">&nbsp;7:21 &nbsp;</A></B> In that hour He healed many from diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many who were blind He graciously gave sight.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:22">&nbsp;7:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And He answered and said to them, Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel announced to them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:23">&nbsp;7:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:24">&nbsp;7:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And when the messengers of John went away, He began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:25">&nbsp;7:25 &nbsp;</A></B> But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft garments? Behold, those who live in splendid apparel and luxury are in royal palaces.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:26">&nbsp;7:26 &nbsp;</A></B> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:27">&nbsp;7:27 &nbsp;</A></B> This is he concerning whom it is written, “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:28">&nbsp;7:28 &nbsp;</A></B> I say to you, Among those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:29">&nbsp;7:29 &nbsp;</A></B> And when all the people and the tax collectors heard <I>this,</I> they acknowledged that God was righteous, since they had been baptized with the baptism of John.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:30">&nbsp;7:30 &nbsp;</A></B> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God for themselves since they had not been baptized by him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:31">&nbsp;7:31 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>And Jesus said,</I> To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:32">&nbsp;7:32 &nbsp;</A></B> They are like little children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, who say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not weep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:33">&nbsp;7:33 &nbsp;</A></B> For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:34">&nbsp;7:34 &nbsp;</A></B> The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:35">&nbsp;7:35 &nbsp;</A></B> Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:36">&nbsp;7:36 &nbsp;</A></B> Now a certain one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He entered into the Pharisee’s house and reclined <I>at table</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:37">&nbsp;7:37 &nbsp;</A></B> And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner, and when she learned that He was reclining <I>at table</I> in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster flask of ointment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:38">&nbsp;7:38 &nbsp;</A></B> And she stood behind <I>Him</I> at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped <I>them</I> with the hair of her head, and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed <I>them</I> with the ointment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:39">&nbsp;7:39 &nbsp;</A></B> But when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw <I>this,</I> he said within himself, This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman <I>this is</I> who is touching Him, because she is a sinner.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:40">&nbsp;7:40 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, say <I>it</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:41">&nbsp;7:41 &nbsp;</A></B> A certain moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:42">&nbsp;7:42 &nbsp;</A></B> But since they had nothing <I>with which</I> to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:43">&nbsp;7:43 &nbsp;</A></B> Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he graciously forgave the more. And He said to him, You have judged correctly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:44">&nbsp;7:44 &nbsp;</A></B> And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you did not give Me water for My feet, but she, with her tears, has wet My feet and with her hair has wiped <I>them</I>.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:45">&nbsp;7:45 &nbsp;</A></B> You did not give Me a kiss, but she, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing My feet affectionately.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:46">&nbsp;7:46 &nbsp;</A></B> You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with ointment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:47">&nbsp;7:47 &nbsp;</A></B> For this reason I say to you, Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:48">&nbsp;7:48 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:49">&nbsp;7:49 &nbsp;</A></B> And those who were reclining <I>at table</I> with <I>Him</I> began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:50">&nbsp;7:50 &nbsp;</A></B> But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.<BR>
