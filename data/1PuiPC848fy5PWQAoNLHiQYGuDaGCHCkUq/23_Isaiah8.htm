</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:1">&nbsp;8:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah said to me, Take a large tablet and write on it in plain letters, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:2">&nbsp;8:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will take faithful witnesses, Urijah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:3">&nbsp;8:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And Jehovah said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:4">&nbsp;8:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For before this boy knows how to call, Father, and, Mother, they will carry off the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:5">&nbsp;8:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah spoke further to me, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:6">&nbsp;8:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Because these people have rejected / The gently flowing waters of Shiloah, and exult / In Rezin and the son of Remaliah,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:7">&nbsp;8:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Now therefore the Lord is bringing up upon them / The mighty and abundant waters of the Euphrates, / The king of Assyria and all his glory; / And it will overflow all its channels, / And go over all its banks.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:8">&nbsp;8:8 &nbsp;</A></B> It will sweep through Judah; it will overflow and rise / Until it reaches the neck; / And the spreading out of its wings / Will fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:9">&nbsp;8:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered; / Hearken, all you distant places of the earth: / Gird yourselves, yet be shattered; / Gird yourselves, yet be shattered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:10">&nbsp;8:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Take counsel, yet it will be frustrated; / Speak the word, yet it will not stand; / For God is with us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:11">&nbsp;8:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah spoke to me in this way with great force and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:12">&nbsp;8:12 &nbsp;</A></B> You shall not call <I>it</I> conspiracy / All that this people calls conspiracy; / And you shall not fear what they fear nor hold <I>it</I> in awe.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:13">&nbsp;8:13 &nbsp;</A></B> You shall sanctify Jehovah of hosts; / He shall be the One to fear and He shall be the One to hold in awe.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:14">&nbsp;8:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Then He will become a sanctuary, yet a stone to strike against / And a rock of stumbling / To both houses of Israel, / A trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:15">&nbsp;8:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And many will stumble at these, / And will fall and be broken to pieces, / And will be snared and taken captive.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:16">&nbsp;8:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Bind up the testimony; seal the instruction among my disciples;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:17">&nbsp;8:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob, and I will look eagerly for Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:18">&nbsp;8:18 &nbsp;</A></B> See, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who abides on Mount Zion.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:19">&nbsp;8:19 &nbsp;</A></B> When they say to you, Inquire of the necromancers and the familiar spirits, who twitter and mutter; <I>say to them,</I> Should not a people inquire of their God? <I>Should they go</I> to the dead on behalf of the living&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:20">&nbsp;8:20 &nbsp;</A></B> To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because in them there is no dawn.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:21">&nbsp;8:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And they go through it hard-pressed and hungry; and when they are hungry, they rage and curse their king and their God. They turn their faces upward,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:22">&nbsp;8:22 &nbsp;</A></B> And they look to the earth, but, there is <I>only</I> distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish and being thrust into darkness.<BR>
