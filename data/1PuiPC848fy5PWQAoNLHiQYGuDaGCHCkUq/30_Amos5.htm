</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear this word that I take up <I>as</I> a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Fallen <I>and</I> no more to rise / Is the virgin of Israel; / She has been cast down upon her land; / There is none to raise her up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says the Lord Jehovah,<BR>The city that sent forth a thousand / Will have a hundred left,<BR>
And that which sent forth a hundred / Will have ten left, / To the house of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel, / Seek Me, and live;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And do not seek Bethel, / Nor go to Gilgal, / Nor pass on to Beer-sheba; / For Gilgal will surely go into captivity, / And Bethel will become vanity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Seek Jehovah, and live; / Lest He rush upon the house of Joseph like fire, / And it devour <I>it,</I> and there be none to extinguish <I>the fire</I> in Bethel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> They turn justice to wormwood / And thrust righteousness down to the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He who makes the Pleiades and Orion / And turns the shadow of death into the morning / And darkens the day with the night; / He who calls for the water of the sea / And pours it upon the surface of the earth, / Jehovah is His name,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Who causes destruction to flash forth upon the strong, / So that destruction comes upon the fortress.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> They hate him who reproves in the gate, / And him who speaks with integrity they abhor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore because you trample upon the poor / And take a forced gift of wheat from them; / You have built houses of hewn stone, / But you will not dwell in them; / You have planted desirable vineyards, / But you will not drink their wine.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> For I know that your transgressions are many / And that your sins are mighty, / <I>You</I> who vex the righteous <I>and</I> take ransom payment / And turn aside <I>justice for</I> the needy in the gate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore he who has insight will keep silent at this time, for it is an evil time.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Seek good and not evil, / In order that you may live; / And so Jehovah the God of hosts will be with you, / As you say.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Hate evil and love good, / And set up justice in the gate. / Perhaps Jehovah the God of hosts will be gracious / To the remnant of Joseph.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says Jehovah, / The God of hosts, the Lord: / In all the open plazas there will be wailing, / And in all the streets they will say, Alas! Alas! / And they will call the farmer to mourning, / And for wailing to those skilled in lamentation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:17">&nbsp;5:17 &nbsp;</A></B> In all the vineyards there will be wailing, / For I will pass through your midst, says Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:18">&nbsp;5:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to you who desire / The day of Jehovah! / What good is the day of Jehovah to you? / It will be darkness and not light,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:19">&nbsp;5:19 &nbsp;</A></B> As when a man flees from before a lion / And encounters a bear, / Or goes into the house and leans his hand against the wall, / And a serpent bites him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:20">&nbsp;5:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Will not the day of Jehovah be darkness and not light, / Even deep darkness and no brightness to it?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:21">&nbsp;5:21 &nbsp;</A></B> I hate, I despise, your feasts, / And I will not delight in your solemn assemblies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:22">&nbsp;5:22 &nbsp;</A></B> For if you offer up to Me burnt offerings / And your meal offerings, I will not accept <I>them;</I> / Nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fatted animals.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:23">&nbsp;5:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Take the noise of your songs away from Me, / For I will not hear the melody of your harps.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:24">&nbsp;5:24 &nbsp;</A></B> But let justice roll down like water, / And righteousness, like an ever-flowing river.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:25">&nbsp;5:25 &nbsp;</A></B>  Did you bring Me sacrifices and meal offerings / In the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:26">&nbsp;5:26 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, you took up Sikkuth your king / And Kiyyun your images, the star of your gods that you made for / yourselves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:27">&nbsp;5:27 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus I will bring you into captivity / Beyond Damascus, says Jehovah; / The God of hosts is His name.<BR>
