</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:1">26:1 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:<BR>
We have a strong city; / He will set up salvation as walls and a rampart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:2">26:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Open the gates / So that the righteous nation may enter, / They who maintain faithfulness.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:4">26:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Trust in Jehovah forever and ever, / For in Jah Jehovah <I>we have</I> an eternal rock.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:5">26:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For He has brought down those who dwell on high, / The lofty city; / He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground; / He casts it into the dust.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:6">26:6 &nbsp;</A></B> The foot will trample it, the foot of the poor, / The steps of the weak.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:7">26:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The path of the righteous is smoothness; / O You who are upright, You make the path of the righteous level.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:8">26:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed in the path of Your judgments, / O Jehovah, we have waited for You. / Your name, that is, Your memorial, / Is the desire of <I>our</I> soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:9">26:9 &nbsp;</A></B> My soul desires You in the night; / Indeed my spirit within me seeks You at the dawn; / For when Your judgments are in the earth, / The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:10">26:10&nbsp;</A></B> <I>Though</I> the wicked is shown grace, / He does not learn righteousness; / In the land of straightforwardness he deals unjustly / And does not perceive the majesty of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:11">26:11&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, Your hand is lifted up, / <I>But</I> they do not see it. / They will see <I>Your</I> zeal for the people and will be put to shame; / Indeed fire will devour Your adversaries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:12">26:12&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, You will ordain peace for us, / For You have also performed all our works for us.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:13">26:13&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah our God, other lords besides You have been master to us, / <I>But</I> through You alone do we mention Your name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:14">26:14&nbsp;</A></B> The dead will not live, / The deceased will not rise; / Therefore You have visited and destroyed them, / And You have caused all memory of them to perish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:15">26:15&nbsp;</A></B> You have increased the nation, O Jehovah; / You have increased the nation&nbsp;— You are glorified; / You have far extended all the edges of the land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:16">26:16&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, in distress they sought You; / They whispered out a prayer, <I>for</I> Your chastening was upon them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:17">26:17&nbsp;</A></B> As a pregnant woman draws near to giving birth, / She writhes <I>and</I> cries out in her pain; / So we have been before You, O Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:18">26:18&nbsp;</A></B> We were pregnant; we writhed; we gave birth, as it were, to wind. / We have not accomplished deliverance for the earth, / Nor have the inhabitants of the world been born.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:19">26:19&nbsp;</A></B> Your dead will live; my corpses will rise. / Awake and give a ringing shout, you who dwell in dust, / For your dew is like the dew of the dawn, / And the earth will bring forth the deceased.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:20">26:20&nbsp;</A></B> Come, my people, enter your rooms, / And shut your doors behind you; / Hide for a short moment / Until the indignation has passed;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:21">26:21&nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah is now coming forth from His place / To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; / And the earth will reveal her bloodshed / And will no longer conceal her slain.<BR>
