</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then again I saw all the acts of oppression that are done under the sun; and indeed, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of the oppressors was power, and they had no comforter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And I praised the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I saw all labor and all skill in work, that it is man’s jealousy for his neighbor. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The fool folds his hands together and consumes his own flesh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Better is a handful with quietness than two hands full with labor and a chasing after wind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Then again I saw vanity under the sun.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> There is one <I>alone</I> and without a second; also he has no son or brother. Yet there is no end to all his labor; moreover his eye is not satisfied with riches. For whom then, <I>he says,</I> do I labor and deprive myself of good? This also is vanity and grievous travail.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls and does not have another to lift him up!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Again, if two lie together, they keep warm. But how can one be warm <I>alone?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And while a man may prevail against the one, the two will withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to be admonished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For <I>one</I> can come forth from prison to reign, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> I saw all the living that went about under the sun with the youth, the successor, who stood up in place of him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> There was no end to all the people, to all before whom he stood, <I>yet</I> even those who come after will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.<BR>
