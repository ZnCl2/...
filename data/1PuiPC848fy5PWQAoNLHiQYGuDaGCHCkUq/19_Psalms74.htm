</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:1">74:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Why, O God, have You cast <I>us</I> off forever? / <I>Why</I> does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:2">74:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember Your assembly, which You have purchased of old, / Which You have redeemed <I>as</I> the tribe of Your inheritance, / <I>And</I> Mount Zion, where You dwell.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:3">74:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Lift up Your steps unto the perpetual ruins; / The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:4">74:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your assembly place; / They have set up their symbols as signs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:5">74:5 &nbsp;</A></B> It looked like when men bring up axes / On the thicket of the trees.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:6">74:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And now they have struck down with hatchet and hammer / Its carved work altogether.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:7">74:7 &nbsp;</A></B> They have set fire to Your sanctuary; / They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:8">74:8 &nbsp;</A></B> They said in their heart, Let us oppress them completely. / They have burned down all God’s assembly places in the land.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:9">74:9 &nbsp;</A></B> We do not see our signs; there is no longer a prophet, / Nor is there anyone among us who knows how long.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:10">74:10&nbsp;</A></B> How long, O God, will the adversary reproach? / Will the enemy despise Your name forever?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:11">74:11&nbsp;</A></B> Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? / <I>Bring it forth</I> from the midst of Your bosom; destroy <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:12">74:12&nbsp;</A></B> But God is my King of old, / Accomplishing salvation in the midst of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:13">74:13&nbsp;</A></B> You divided the sea by Your strength; / You broke the heads of the sea serpents on the waters.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:14">74:14&nbsp;</A></B> You crushed the heads of the leviathan; / You gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:15">74:15&nbsp;</A></B> You broke open the fountain and the torrent; / You dried up the ever-flowing streams.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:16">74:16&nbsp;</A></B> The day is Yours; the night also is Yours; / You prepared the moon and the sun.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:17">74:17&nbsp;</A></B> You established all the borders of the earth: / You formed the summer and the winter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:18">74:18&nbsp;</A></B> Remember this: The enemy has reproached Jehovah, / And a foolish people has despised Your name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:19">74:19&nbsp;</A></B> Do not give the soul of Your turtledove to the wild beast; / Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:20">74:20&nbsp;</A></B> Regard the covenant, / For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:21">74:21&nbsp;</A></B> Do not let him who is oppressed return ashamed. / May the poor and needy praise Your name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="74:22">74:22&nbsp;</A></B> Arise, O God; contend for Your own cause; / Remember how the foolish man reproaches You all day long.<BR>
