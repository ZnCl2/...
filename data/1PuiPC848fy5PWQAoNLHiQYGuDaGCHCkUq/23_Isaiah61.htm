</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:1">61:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me, / Because Jehovah has anointed Me / To bring good news to the afflicted; / He has sent Me to bind up <I>the wounds</I> of the brokenhearted, / To proclaim liberty to the captives, / And the opening <I>of the eyes</I> to those who are bound;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:2">61:2 &nbsp;</A></B> To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah / And the day of vengeance of our God; / To comfort all who mourn;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:3">61:3 &nbsp;</A></B> To grant to those who mourn in Zion, / To give to them a headdress instead of ashes, / The oil of gladness instead of mourning, / The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness; / That they may be called the terebinths of righteousness, / The planting of Jehovah, that He may be glorified.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:4">61:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And they will rebuild the ancient ruins; / They will raise up the former desolations; / And they will repair the cities of waste, / The desolations of generation upon generation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:5">61:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And strangers will stand and feed your flocks, / And the sons of the foreigner will be your plowmen and vinedressers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:6">61:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But you will be called the priests of Jehovah; / <I>People</I> will speak of you as the ministers of our God. / You will eat the wealth of nations, / And you will boast in their glory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:7">61:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Instead of your shame <I>there will be</I> a double <I>portion,</I> / And <I>instead</I> of humiliation they will give a ringing shout for their portion. / Therefore in their land they will possess double; / Eternal joy will be theirs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:8">61:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For I, Jehovah, love justice; / I hate robbery with wrong; / And I will faithfully give <I>them</I> their recompense, / And I will make an eternal covenant with them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:9">61:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Then their seed will be known among the nations, / And their offspring in the midst of the peoples; / All who see them will acknowledge them, / That they are the seed whom Jehovah has blessed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:10">61:10&nbsp;</A></B> I will rejoice greatly in Jehovah, / My soul will exult in my God; / For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, / He has wrapped me with the robe of righteousness; / <I>I am</I> like a bridegroom who wears the headdress of the priest, / And like a bride who adorns herself with her jewels.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="61:11">61:11&nbsp;</A></B> For as the earth brings forth its sprout, / And as the garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, / So will the Lord Jehovah cause righteousness and praise / To spring up before all the nations.<BR>
