</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:10">19:10&nbsp;</A></B> And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be a perpetual statute to the children of Israel and to the stranger who sojourns among them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:12">19:12&nbsp;</A></B> He shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day, and then he shall be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:13">19:13&nbsp;</A></B> Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a human being who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from Israel.

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="19:14">19:14&nbsp;</A></B> This is the law when a man dies in a tent: Anyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.<BR>
