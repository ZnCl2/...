</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:1">16:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this one was accused to him of squandering his possessions.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:2">16:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:3">16:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:4">16:4 &nbsp;</A></B> I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship they may receive me into their own houses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:5">16:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And when he had called to <I>him</I> each one of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:6">16:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:7">16:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:8">16:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent <I>in their dealings</I> with their own generation than the sons of light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:9">16:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:10">16:10&nbsp;</A></B> He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:11">16:11&nbsp;</A></B> If therefore you have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is true?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:12">16:12&nbsp;</A></B> And if you have not become faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give to you that which is your own?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:13">16:13&nbsp;</A></B> No household servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:14">16:14&nbsp;</A></B> And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things and were sneering at Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:15">16:15&nbsp;</A></B> And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:16">16:16&nbsp;</A></B> The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed as the gospel, and everyone forces his way into it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:17">16:17&nbsp;</A></B> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fail.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:18">16:18&nbsp;</A></B> Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from <I>her</I> husband commits adultery.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:19">16:19&nbsp;</A></B> Now there was a certain rich man, and he clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry every day in splendor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:20">16:20&nbsp;</A></B> And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:21">16:21&nbsp;</A></B> And longing to be satisfied with the things falling from the rich man’s table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:22">16:22&nbsp;</A></B> And the beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:23">16:23&nbsp;</A></B> And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:24">16:24&nbsp;</A></B> And he called out and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this flame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:25">16:25&nbsp;</A></B> But Abraham said, Child, remember that in your lifetime you fully received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:26">16:26&nbsp;</A></B> And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may <I>any</I> cross over.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:27">16:27&nbsp;</A></B> And he said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father&nbsp;—<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:28">16:28&nbsp;</A></B> For I have five brothers&nbsp;— so that he may solemnly testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:29">16:29&nbsp;</A></B> But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:30">16:30&nbsp;</A></B> But he said, No, Father Abraham; but if someone <I>risen</I> from the dead would go to them, they will repent.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="16:31">16:31&nbsp;</A></B> But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.<BR>
