</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able <I>to receive it.</I> But neither yet now are you able,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For you are still fleshly. For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to <I>the manner of</I> man?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men <I>of flesh?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one <I>of them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s cultivated land, God’s building.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon <I>it.</I> But let each man take heed how he builds upon <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> The work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare <I>it,</I> because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one’s work, of what sort it is.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone’s work which he has built upon <I>the foundation</I> remains, he will receive a reward;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone’s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and <I>that</I> the Spirit of God dwells in you?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, <I>and</I> such are you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Let no one deceive himself; if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, “He grasps the wise in their craftiness”;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:20">&nbsp;3:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And again, “The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:21">&nbsp;3:21 &nbsp;</A></B> So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:22">&nbsp;3:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:23">&nbsp;3:23 &nbsp;</A></B> But you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.<BR>
