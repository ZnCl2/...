</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:2">35:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:3">35:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And let us rise up and go up to Bethel, that I may make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:4">35:4 &nbsp;</A></B> So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand and the rings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak that was near Shechem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:5">35:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And as they journeyed, the terror of God was upon the cities that were around them, so they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:7">35:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And he built an altar there and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:8">35:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; so its name was called Allon-bacuth.<BR>

Thus He called his name Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:11">35:11&nbsp;</A></B> And God said to him,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:12">35:12&nbsp;</A></B> And the land which I gave to Abraham and to Isaac, / I will give to you; / And I will give the land to your seed after you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:13">35:13&nbsp;</A></B> Then God went up from him in the place where He had spoken with him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:14">35:14&nbsp;</A></B> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:16">35:16&nbsp;</A></B> And they journeyed from Bethel. And while there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth; and she had hard labor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:17">35:17&nbsp;</A></B> And while she was in hardest labor, the midwife said to her, Do not be afraid, for now you have <I>another</I> son.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:18">35:18&nbsp;</A></B> And as her soul was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:19">35:19&nbsp;</A></B> So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="35:20">35:20&nbsp;</A></B> And Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave, <I>which is there</I> to this day.<BR>
