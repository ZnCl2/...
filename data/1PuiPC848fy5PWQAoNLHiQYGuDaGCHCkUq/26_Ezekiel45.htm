</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:1">45:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Moreover when you divide the land for inheritance by lot, you shall offer a heave offering <I>of land</I> to Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; <I>its</I> length shall be twenty-five thousand <I>reeds</I> long, and <I>its</I> width twenty thousand <I>reeds;</I> it shall be holy within all its surrounding border.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:2">45:2 &nbsp;</A></B> From this there will be <I>reserved</I> for the holy place a five hundred <I>reed</I> by five hundred <I>reed</I> square all around, and fifty cubits for its surrounding suburbs.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:3">45:3 &nbsp;</A></B> You shall also measure from this measurement a length of twenty-five thousand <I>reeds</I> and a width of ten thousand <I>reeds,</I> and in it will be the sanctuary, the most holy place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:4">45:4 &nbsp;</A></B> It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Jehovah, and it shall be a place for their houses as well as a holy area for the sanctuary.<BR>

Thus the <I>total</I> length corresponds to one of the <I>tribal</I> portions from the western border to the eastern border.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:8">45:8 &nbsp;</A></B> In the land it shall be his possession in Israel. And My princes shall no longer oppress My people, but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.<BR>
