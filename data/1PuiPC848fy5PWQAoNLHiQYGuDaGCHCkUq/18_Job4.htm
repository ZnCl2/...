</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> If one attempts a word with you, will you be wearied <I>by it?</I> / But who can refrain from speaking?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, you have instructed many, / And you have strengthened the weak hands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Your words have raised up him who was stumbling, / And you have made the bowing knees firm.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But now it comes to you, and you are wearied <I>by it;</I> / It touches you, and you are disturbed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Is not your fear <I>of God</I> your confidence, / And the integrity of your ways your hope?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Remember now, who, being innocent, has <I>ever</I> perished? / And where have the upright <I>ever</I> been cut off?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity / And those who sow trouble reap the same.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> By the breath of God they perish, / And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> The roaring of the lion and the sound of the fierce lion / And the teeth of the young lions are broken;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, / And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> But a matter has stolen in unto me, / And my ear has received a whisper of it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> In perplexing thoughts of the night visions, / When deep sleep falls upon men,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Dread came upon me, and trembling, / And caused all my bones to dread.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And a spirit passed before my face; / The hair of my flesh bristled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; / A form <I>stood</I> before my eyes; / I heard a murmur of a voice:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Can a mortal man be more righteous than God? / Can a man be purer than his Maker?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:18">&nbsp;4:18 &nbsp;</A></B> If He puts no trust in His servants, / And He charges His angels with error,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:19">&nbsp;4:19 &nbsp;</A></B> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, / Whose foundation is in dust, / Who are crushed like a moth!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:20">&nbsp;4:20 &nbsp;</A></B> From morning to evening they are smashed to pieces; / Without any considering <I>it,</I> they continually perish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:21">&nbsp;4:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Should their tent cord be plucked up within them, / They die, and not in wisdom.<BR>
