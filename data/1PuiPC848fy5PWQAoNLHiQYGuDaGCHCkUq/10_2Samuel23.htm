</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:1">23:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Now these are the last words of David:<BR>
The declaration of David the son of Jesse, / And the declaration of the man who has been raised up on high, / The anointed of the God of Jacob, / The one lovely in the psalms of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:2">23:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The Spirit of Jehovah spoke through me, / And His word was on my tongue.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:3">23:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The God of Israel spoke, / The Rock of Israel spoke to me, / Who rules among men righteously, / Who rules with the fear of God,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:4">23:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And is like the light of the morning when the sun rises, / A morning without clouds, / <I>As when</I> the tender grass <I>sprouts up</I> from the earth / At the <I>sun’s</I> shining after a rain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:5">23:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For is not my house so with God? / For He has made an eternal covenant with me, / Ordered in all things and secure. / For all my salvation and all <I>my</I> desire, / Will He not indeed make them grow?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:6">23:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But the wicked, all of them, will be / Like thorns to be thrust away, / Because they cannot be taken with the hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:7">23:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But the man who touches them / Must arm himself with an iron rod or with the shaft of a spear; / And they will be burned with fire in <I>their</I> place.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:8">23:8 &nbsp;</A></B> These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was the chief of the captains; the same is Adino the Eznite, <I>who fought</I> against eight hundred, who were slain at one time.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:9">23:9 &nbsp;</A></B> After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the son of an Ahohite, <I>one</I> among the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel went away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:10">23:10&nbsp;</A></B> He rose up and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary; and his hand clung to the sword, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation that day; and the people returned after him, but only to strip <I>the slain.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:11">23:11&nbsp;</A></B> And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. Now the Philistines were gathered into a troop where there was a plot of land full of lentils, and the people fled before the Philistines.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:12">23:12&nbsp;</A></B> But he stationed himself in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck the Philistines, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:13">23:13&nbsp;</A></B> Now three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest time in the cave of Adullam; and the Philistine troop was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:14">23:14&nbsp;</A></B> Now at that time David was in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was at that time in Bethlehem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:15">23:15&nbsp;</A></B> And David said longingly, If only someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:16">23:16&nbsp;</A></B> And the three mighty men burst through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate. And they carried <I>it</I> and brought <I>it</I> to David, but he would not drink it; rather he poured it out to Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:17">23:17&nbsp;</A></B> And he said, Far be it from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this! <I>Shall I drink</I> the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:18">23:18&nbsp;</A></B> And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. And he brandished his spear against three hundred, <I>who were</I> slain; and he had a name among the three.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:19">23:19&nbsp;</A></B> He was indeed the most honored among the thirty, and he became their leader; but he did not attain to the three.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:20">23:20&nbsp;</A></B> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, was great in mighty deeds. He struck the two <I>sons</I> of Ariel the Moabite; he also went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:21">23:21&nbsp;</A></B> And he struck an Egyptian, an imposing man. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian and slew him with his own spear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:22">23:22&nbsp;</A></B> These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and he had a name among the three mighty men.<BR>
