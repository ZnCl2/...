</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:1">&nbsp;6:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:2">&nbsp;6:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ completely.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:3">&nbsp;6:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:4">&nbsp;6:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But let each man prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:5">&nbsp;6:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For each one shall bear his own load.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:6">&nbsp;6:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But let him who is instructed in the word share in all good things with him who instructs.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:7">&nbsp;6:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:8">&nbsp;6:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:9">&nbsp;6:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And let us not lose heart in doing what is good, for in the proper season we will reap if we do not faint.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:10">&nbsp;6:10 &nbsp;</A></B> So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:11">&nbsp;6:11 &nbsp;</A></B> See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:12">&nbsp;6:12 &nbsp;</A></B> As many as desire to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, <I>but</I> only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:13">&nbsp;6:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For neither do they that become circumcised keep the law themselves, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:14">&nbsp;6:14 &nbsp;</A></B> But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:15">&nbsp;6:15 &nbsp;</A></B> For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation <I>is what matters.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:16">&nbsp;6:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:17">&nbsp;6:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="6:18">&nbsp;6:18 &nbsp;</A></B> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.<BR>
