</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:1">&nbsp;8:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Does not wisdom call, / And understanding lift up her voice?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:2">&nbsp;8:2 &nbsp;</A></B> On the top of the heights, by the way, / Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:3">&nbsp;8:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, / At the entrance of the doors, she cries aloud:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:4">&nbsp;8:4 &nbsp;</A></B> To you, O men, I call; / And my voice is to the sons of men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:5">&nbsp;8:5 &nbsp;</A></B> O simple ones, understand prudence; / And, O fools, be of an understanding heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:6">&nbsp;8:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear, for I will speak noble things; / And the opening of my lips <I>will yield</I> right things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:7">&nbsp;8:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For my mouth will utter truth, / And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:8">&nbsp;8:8 &nbsp;</A></B> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; / There is nothing twisted or crooked in them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:9">&nbsp;8:9 &nbsp;</A></B> They are all straight to him who understands, / And right to those who find knowledge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:10">&nbsp;8:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Receive my instruction, and not silver; / And knowledge rather than choice gold.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:11">&nbsp;8:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For wisdom is better than corals, / And nothing that <I>you</I> desire compares with her.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:12">&nbsp;8:12 &nbsp;</A></B> I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, / And I find knowledge <I>and</I> discretion.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:13">&nbsp;8:13 &nbsp;</A></B> The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; / Pride and arrogance and the evil way / And the perverse mouth, I hate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:14">&nbsp;8:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Counsel is mine and sound wisdom; / I am understanding; I have might.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:15">&nbsp;8:15 &nbsp;</A></B> By me kings reign, / And rulers decree justice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:16">&nbsp;8:16 &nbsp;</A></B> By me princes rule, / And nobles&nbsp;— all who judge righteously.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:17">&nbsp;8:17 &nbsp;</A></B> I love those who love me, / And those who seek me diligently will find me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:18">&nbsp;8:18 &nbsp;</A></B> Riches and honor are with me, / Enduring wealth and righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:19">&nbsp;8:19 &nbsp;</A></B> My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; / And my yield than choice silver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:20">&nbsp;8:20 &nbsp;</A></B> I walk in the way of righteousness, / In the midst of the paths of justice,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:21">&nbsp;8:21 &nbsp;</A></B> That I may cause those who love me to inherit substance / And that I may fill their treasuries.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:22">&nbsp;8:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way, / Before His works of old.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:23">&nbsp;8:23 &nbsp;</A></B> I was set up from eternity, / From the beginning, before the earth was.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:24">&nbsp;8:24 &nbsp;</A></B> When there were no depths, I was brought forth, / When there were no fountains abounding with water.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:25">&nbsp;8:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Before the mountains were settled, / Before the hills, I was brought forth;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:26">&nbsp;8:26 &nbsp;</A></B> When He had not yet made the earth and the fields, / Nor the first dust of the world.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:27">&nbsp;8:27 &nbsp;</A></B> When He established the heavens, I was there; / When He inscribed a circle upon the surface of the deep,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:28">&nbsp;8:28 &nbsp;</A></B> When He made firm the skies above, / When the fountains of the deep became strong,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:29">&nbsp;8:29 &nbsp;</A></B> When He set for the sea its boundary, / That the waters should not transgress His commandment, / When He marked out the foundations of the earth;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:30">&nbsp;8:30 &nbsp;</A></B> Then I was by Him, <I>as a</I> master workman; / And I was daily <I>His</I> delight, / Rejoicing always before Him,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:31">&nbsp;8:31 &nbsp;</A></B> Rejoicing in His habitable earth; / And my delight was in the sons of men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:32">&nbsp;8:32 &nbsp;</A></B> Now therefore, <I>my</I> sons, listen to me; / For blessed are they who keep my ways.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:33">&nbsp;8:33 &nbsp;</A></B> Hear instruction, and be wise; / And do not neglect it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:34">&nbsp;8:34 &nbsp;</A></B> Blessed is the man who listens to me, / Watching daily at my doors, / Waiting at my doorposts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:35">&nbsp;8:35 &nbsp;</A></B> For whoever finds me finds life, / And will obtain favor from Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="8:36">&nbsp;8:36 &nbsp;</A></B> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul; / All who hate me love death.<BR>
