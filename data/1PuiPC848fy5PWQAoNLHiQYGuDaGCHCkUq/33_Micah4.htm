</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> But in the last days / The mountain of the house of Jehovah / Will be established on the top of the mountains; / And it will be lifted up above the hills; / And the peoples will stream to it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And many nations will come and say, / Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah / And to the house of the God of Jacob; / That He may instruct us in His ways, / And that we may walk in His paths; / For from Zion will go forth instruction, / And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And He will judge between many peoples / And will decide <I>matters</I> for numerous nations from afar. / And they will beat their swords into plowshares / And their spears into pruning knives; / Nation will not lift up sword against nation, / Nor will they learn war anymore.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And they will each sit underneath his vine / And underneath his fig tree, / And no one will disturb <I>them;</I> / For the mouth of Jehovah of hosts has spoken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For all the peoples will walk, / Each in the name of his god; / But we will walk / In the name of Jehovah our God / Forever and ever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day, / Declares Jehovah, / I will gather her that limps, / And her that has been driven out I will collect, / As well as her that I have afflicted;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will make her that limps a remnant, / And her that has been cast far away a mighty nation; / And Jehovah will reign over them in Mount Zion / From then on, and even forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And you, O tower of the flock, / O hill of the daughter of Zion, / To you will it come, / Indeed the first dominion will come, / The kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Why do you now cry out aloud? / Is there no king among you? / Has your counselor perished, / That pain has seized you like a woman delivering a child?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Suffer the pain and thrust forth, / O daughter of Zion, like a woman delivering a child. / For now you will go forth from the city / And dwell in the field; / And you will go into Babylon. / And there you will be delivered; / There Jehovah will redeem you / From the hand of your enemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And now many nations / Are gathered against you, / They who say, Let her be profaned, / And let our eyes gaze on Zion.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> But they do not know / The thoughts of Jehovah, / And they do not understand His counsel; / For He has gathered them like sheaves for the threshing floor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; / For I will make your horn iron, / And I will make your hooves bronze; / And you will crush many peoples to powder. / And I will devote their profit to Jehovah, / And their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.<BR>
