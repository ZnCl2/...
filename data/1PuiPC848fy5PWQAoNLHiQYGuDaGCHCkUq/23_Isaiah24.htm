</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:1">24:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah now makes the earth desolate and lays it waste; He distorts its surface and scatters its inhabitants:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:2">24:2 &nbsp;</A></B> As it is with the people, so will it be with the priest; / As it is with the servant, so will it be with the master; / As it is with the maid, so will it be with the mistress; / As it is with the buyer, so will it be with the seller; / As it is with the lender, so will it be with the borrower; / As it is with the creditor, so will it be with him to whom he gives credit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:3">24:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The earth will be utterly desolated / And utterly spoiled, / For Jehovah has spoken this word.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:4">24:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The earth dries up and fades away; / The world languishes and fades away; / The exalted of the people of the earth languish.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:5">24:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And the earth is polluted under <I>the weight</I> of its inhabitants; / For they have transgressed laws, they have violated statutes, / They have broken an eternal covenant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:6">24:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore a curse devours the earth / And the inhabitants of it are held guilty; / Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, / And few men are left.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:7">24:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The new wine mourns; the vine languishes; / All the merryhearted sigh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:8">24:8 &nbsp;</A></B> The mirth of the tambourines ceases; / The noise of those who exult stops; / The mirth of the lyre ceases.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:9">24:9 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>Men</I> do not drink wine in song; / Liquor is bitter to those who drink it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:10">24:10&nbsp;</A></B> The city of chaos is broken down; / Every house is shut up that none may enter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:11">24:11&nbsp;</A></B> A cry for wine is in the streets; / All joy is darkened; / The mirth of the land is departed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:12">24:12&nbsp;</A></B> In the city desolation remains, / And the gate is crushed to ruins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:13">24:13&nbsp;</A></B> For thus will it be in the midst of the earth, / Among the peoples: / Like the shaking of an olive tree, / Like the gleanings when the grape harvest is completed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:14">24:14&nbsp;</A></B> They will lift up their voice; they will give a ringing shout; / Because of the majesty of Jehovah they will cry out from the west.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:15">24:15&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore in the east glorify Jehovah, / Even the name of Jehovah the God of Israel in the coastlands of the sea.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:16">24:16&nbsp;</A></B> From the ends of the earth we hear songs: / Glory to the righteous One! / But I say, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! / The unfaithful deal unfaithfully! / Indeed the unfaithful deal most unfaithfully!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:17">24:17&nbsp;</A></B> Dread, pit, and snare / Are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:18">24:18&nbsp;</A></B> And he who flees from the sound of dread / Will fall into the pit, / And he who comes up out of the pit / Will be taken in the snare; / For the windows from on high are open, / And the foundations of the earth shake.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:19">24:19&nbsp;</A></B> The earth is broken asunder; / The earth is split through and through; / The earth is shaken violently.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:20">24:20&nbsp;</A></B> The earth staggers back and forth like a drunkard / And sways about like a field hut. / And its transgression weighs heavily upon it; / It will fall and will not rise again.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:21">24:21&nbsp;</A></B> And in that day Jehovah will punish / On high the host on high, / And the kings of the earth on the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:22">24:22&nbsp;</A></B> And they will be gathered together, / <I>Like</I> prisoners gathered in a dungeon; / And will be shut up in prison, / And after many days they will be punished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:23">24:23&nbsp;</A></B> Then the moon will be abashed, and the sun will be ashamed; / For Jehovah of hosts will reign / In Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, / And <I>His</I> glory will be before His elders.<BR>
