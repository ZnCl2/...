</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:1">&nbsp;4:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Where <I>do</I> wars and fightings among you <I>come from?</I> Are they not from this, from your pleasures that war in your members?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:2">&nbsp;4:2 &nbsp;</A></B> You lust and do not have; you murder and are jealous and are not able to obtain; you fight and make war. You do not have because you do not ask;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:3">&nbsp;4:3 &nbsp;</A></B> You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend <I>it</I> on your pleasures.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:4">&nbsp;4:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:5">&nbsp;4:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy?<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:6">&nbsp;4:6 &nbsp;</A></B> But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, “God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.”<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:7">&nbsp;4:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil, and he will flee from you.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:8">&nbsp;4:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse <I>your</I> hands, sinners, and purify <I>your</I> hearts, <I>you</I> double-souled!<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:9">&nbsp;4:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Endure misery and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into dejection.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:10">&nbsp;4:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:11">&nbsp;4:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:12">&nbsp;4:12 &nbsp;</A></B> One is Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and destroy. But who are you who judge your neighbor?<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:13">&nbsp;4:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:14">&nbsp;4:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Whereas you do not know the matter of tomorrow, what your life will be; for you are a vapor, which appears for a little while and then disappears.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:15">&nbsp;4:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Instead you <I>ought</I> to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live and do this or that.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:16">&nbsp;4:16 &nbsp;</A></B> But now you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="4:17">&nbsp;4:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do <I>it,</I> to him it is sin.<BR>
