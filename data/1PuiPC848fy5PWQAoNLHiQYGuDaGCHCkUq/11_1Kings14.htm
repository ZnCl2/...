</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:1">14:1 &nbsp;</A></B> At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became ill.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:2">14:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jeroboam said to his wife, Rise up now, and disguise yourself so that no one will recognize that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there; it is he who spoke concerning me, that <I>I should be</I> king over this people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:3">14:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And take in your hand ten loaves and some cakes and a cruse of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:4">14:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jeroboam’s wife did so; that is, she rose up and went to Shiloh, and she came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were fixed because of his age.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:5">14:5 &nbsp;</A></B> But Jehovah said to Ahijah, The wife of Jeroboam has now come to seek a word from you concerning her son, for he is ill. Thus and thus shall you speak to her. And it will be that when she comes in, she will pretend to be another woman.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:6">14:6 &nbsp;</A></B> So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she entered through the door, he said, Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another woman? For I have a hard message for you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:7">14:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Go <I>and</I> tell Jeroboam, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Because I exalted you from among the people and made you ruler over My people Israel,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:8">14:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And I tore away the kingdom from the house of David and gave it to you; and yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was upright in My sight,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:9">14:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But you have done more evil than all who were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods and idols, so as to provoke Me to anger; and you have cast Me behind your back&nbsp;— <BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:10">14:10&nbsp;</A></B> Because of this then, I am now bringing evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, bond and free, in Israel; and I will sweep up after the house of Jeroboam as <I>a man</I> might sweep up dung until it is all gone.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:11">14:11&nbsp;</A></B> Him of Jeroboam’s who dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and him who dies in the field, the birds of heaven will eat; for Jehovah has spoken <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:12">14:12&nbsp;</A></B> Rise up then, and go to your house: When your feet enter the city, the child will die.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:13">14:13&nbsp;</A></B> And all Israel will mourn for him and bury him, for he alone of Jeroboam’s will go into the grave, because in him some good thing toward Jehovah the God of Israel was found among the house of Jeroboam.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:14">14:14&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam this day and even now.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:15">14:15&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He will uproot Israel out of this good land, which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they made their Asherahs, provoking Jehovah to anger.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:16">14:16&nbsp;</A></B> And He will give Israel up on account of the sins of Jeroboam, by which he sinned and by which he caused Israel to sin.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:17">14:17&nbsp;</A></B> And Jeroboam’s wife rose up and departed, and she came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house, the boy died.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:18">14:18&nbsp;</A></B> And all Israel buried him and mourned for him according to the word of Jehovah, which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:19">14:19&nbsp;</A></B> And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he waged war and how he reigned, they are there written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:20">14:20&nbsp;</A></B> And the time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years; and he slept with his fathers. And Nadab his son reigned in his place.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:21">14:21&nbsp;</A></B> And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city where Jehovah had chosen, out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name. And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:22">14:22&nbsp;</A></B> And Judah did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah and provoked Him to jealousy because of the sins which they committed, above all <I>the sins</I> which their fathers had committed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:23">14:23&nbsp;</A></B> And they also built for themselves high places and pillars and Asherahs on every high hill and under every flourishing tree,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:24">14:24&nbsp;</A></B> And there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They acted according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:25">14:25&nbsp;</A></B> Then in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:26">14:26&nbsp;</A></B> And he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house; indeed he took away all. And he took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:27">14:27&nbsp;</A></B> And King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place and committed them into the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:28">14:28&nbsp;</A></B> And whenever the king went into the house of Jehovah, the guards carried them and returned them to the guardroom.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:29">14:29&nbsp;</A></B> And the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:30">14:30&nbsp;</A></B> And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:31">14:31&nbsp;</A></B> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.<BR>

And Abijam his son reigned in his place.<BR>
