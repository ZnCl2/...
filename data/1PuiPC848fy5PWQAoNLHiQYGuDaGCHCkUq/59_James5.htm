</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Come now, you rich, weep, howling over your miseries, which are coming upon you!<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten;<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Your gold and your silver have rusted, and their rust will be a testimony against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Behold, the wages of the workmen who mowed your fields, which have been withheld by you, cry out; and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> You have lived luxuriously on the earth and have given yourselves to pleasure; you have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> You condemned, you murdered the righteous; he does not resist you.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late rain.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord has drawn near.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Do not complain, brothers, against one another lest you be judged. Behold, the Judge stands before the doors.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> As an example, brothers, of suffering evil and of long-suffering, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Behold, we call those who endured blessed. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen his end from the Lord, that the Lord is very tenderhearted and compassionate.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> But above all things, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven nor by earth nor with any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no, no, lest you fall under judgment.<BR> 

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Does anyone among you suffer evil? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed. The petition of a righteous man avails much in its working.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:17">&nbsp;5:17 &nbsp;</A></B> Elijah was a man of like feeling with us, and he earnestly prayed that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:18">&nbsp;5:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth sprouted forth <I>with</I> its fruit.<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:19">&nbsp;5:19 &nbsp;</A></B> My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back,<BR> 
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:20">&nbsp;5:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one’s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.<BR>
