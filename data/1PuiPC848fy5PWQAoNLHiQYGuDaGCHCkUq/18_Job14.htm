</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:1">14:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Man, born of woman, / Is of few days and full of trouble.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:2">14:2 &nbsp;</A></B> He comes forth like a blossom and is cut down, / He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:3">14:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And do You open Your eyes upon such a one / And bring me into litigation with You?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:4">14:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Who can bring a clean thing out from the unclean? / No one!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:5">14:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Since his days are determined, / <I>And</I> the number of his months is with You; / <I>Since</I> You have appointed his bounds, and he cannot go beyond;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:6">14:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Look away from him that he may rest, / Until he fulfills his day like a hired hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:7">14:7 &nbsp;</A></B> For there is hope for a tree: / If it is cut down, it will sprout again, / And its tender shoot will not cease.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:8">14:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Though its root grows old in the earth, / And its trunk dies in the dirt,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:9">14:9 &nbsp;</A></B> At the scent of water it will bud / And will produce branches like a <I>new</I> plant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:10">14:10&nbsp;</A></B> But a man dies and is laid low; / Yes, a man expires, and then where is he?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:11">14:11&nbsp;</A></B> The waters of the sea recede, / And the river becomes parched and dried up:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:12">14:12&nbsp;</A></B> So a man lies down and does not rise up; / Until the heavens are no more, he will not awake, / Nor will he be roused from his sleep.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:13">14:13&nbsp;</A></B> Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol, / That You would conceal me until Your anger has passed, / That You would set me an appointed time and remember me!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:14">14:14&nbsp;</A></B> If a man dies, will he live <I>again?</I> / All the days of my service I would wait, / Until a change for me should come.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:15">14:15&nbsp;</A></B> You would call, and I would answer You; / You would long after the work of Your hands.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:16">14:16&nbsp;</A></B> For now You number my steps. / Do You not watch over my sin?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:17">14:17&nbsp;</A></B> My transgression has been sealed up in a bag, / And You have fastened up my iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:18">14:18&nbsp;</A></B> However the mountain falls <I>and</I> crumbles, / And the rock moves from its place;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:19">14:19&nbsp;</A></B> Waters wear away stones; / Their torrents wash away the dust of the earth: / So You destroy the hope of man.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:20">14:20&nbsp;</A></B> You prevail forever against him, and he passes away; / You change his countenance and send him away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:21">14:21&nbsp;</A></B> His sons gain honor, but he does not know <I>it;</I> / And they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="14:22">14:22&nbsp;</A></B> Only the pain of his own flesh does he feel, / And his own soul mourns for him.<BR>
