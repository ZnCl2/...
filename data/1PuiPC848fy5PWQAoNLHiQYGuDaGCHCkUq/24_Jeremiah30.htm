</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:2">30:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus speaks Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Write in a book all the words which I have spoken to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:3">30:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Yes indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will turn the captivity of My people Israel and Judah, says Jehovah, and I will bring them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:4">30:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And these are the words which Jehovah spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:5">30:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / We have heard a voice of trembling, / Of fear and not of peace.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:6">30:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Ask now and see / Whether a man can give birth. / Why do I see every man / With his hands on his loins like a woman about to give birth / And every face turned pale?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:7">30:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Alas! For that day is great, / And there is none like it; / And it is a time of distress for Jacob, / But he will be saved out of it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:8">30:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And on that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, I will break his yoke from your neck and tear off your bonds, and strangers will no longer make him serve <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:9">30:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But they will serve Jehovah their God and David their King, whom I will raise up for them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:10">30:10&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore do not fear, O Jacob My servant, declares Jehovah, / And do not be dismayed, O Israel; / For indeed, I will save you from afar, / And your seed from the land of their captivity; / And Jacob will return and be undisturbed and at ease, / And no one will frighten <I>him.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:11">30:11&nbsp;</A></B> For I am with you, declares Jehovah, to save you; / For I will make a full end of all the nations to which I have scattered you; / But I will not make a full end of you, / But will correct you in measure / And will by no means leave you unpunished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:12">30:12&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / Your hurt is incurable; / Your wound is grievous.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:13">30:13&nbsp;</A></B> There is none to judge your judgment, to bind <I>your wound;</I> / There are no healing medicines for you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:14">30:14&nbsp;</A></B> All your lovers have forgotten you; / They do not search for you; / For I have struck you with the striking of an enemy, / With the chastisement of one who is cruel, / Because of the greatness of your iniquity; / Your sins are numerous.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:15">30:15&nbsp;</A></B> Why do you cry out over your hurt? / Your pain is incurable. / Because of the greatness of your iniquity, / <I>Because</I> your sins are numerous, / I have done these things to you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:16">30:16&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore all those who consume you will be consumed, / And all those who distress you, every one of them, will go into captivity; / And those who plunder you will become plunder, / And all those who prey on you I will make a prey.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:17">30:17&nbsp;</A></B> For I will bring you recovery / And will heal you of your wounds, declares Jehovah; / Because they have called you an outcast, <I>saying,</I> / She is Zion, whom no one searches after.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:18">30:18&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / I will turn the captivity of the tents of Jacob / And have compassion on his dwelling places; / And the city will be rebuilt on its mound, / And the palace will be inhabited after its own manner.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:19">30:19&nbsp;</A></B> And out from them will come thanksgiving / And the voice of those who make merry. / And I will multiply them, so that they will not be few; / And I will cause them to be honored, so that they will not be small.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:20">30:20&nbsp;</A></B> And their children will be as <I>they were</I> of old, / And their assembly will be established before Me; / And I will punish all those who oppress them,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:21">30:21&nbsp;</A></B>  And their leader will be one of them. / And their ruler will come out from their midst, / And I will bring him near, and he will approach Me. / For who else would be bold enough / To approach Me? declares Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:22">30:22&nbsp;</A></B> And you will be My people, / And I will be your God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:23">30:23&nbsp;</A></B> Look, the storm wind of Jehovah! / Wrath has gone forth, / A whirling tempest; / It will whirl down on the head of the wicked.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="30:24">30:24&nbsp;</A></B> The burning anger of Jehovah will not turn back, / Until He has executed and until He has accomplished / The purposes of His heart; / In the last days / You will understand it.<BR>
