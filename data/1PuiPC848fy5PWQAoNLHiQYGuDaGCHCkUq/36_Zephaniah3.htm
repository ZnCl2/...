</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to the rebellious and defiled one, / To the oppressing city!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> She has not listened to the voice; / She has not taken the correction. / She has not trusted in Jehovah; / She has not drawn near to her God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Her princes in the midst of her / Are roaring lions. / Her judges are wolves of the evening; / They have left nothing until the morning.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Her prophets are vainglorious; / They are men of treachery. / Her priests have defiled the sanctuary; / They have done violence to the law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah is righteous in the midst of her; / He does no wrong; / Morning by morning He brings His justice to light; / He does not fail; but he who is wrong knows no shame.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I have cut off nations; / Their battlements are desolated; / I have made their streets a waste, / So that no one passes through; / Their cities are destroyed, / So that there is no one, / So that there is no inhabitant.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> I said, Only fear Me; / Take the correction; / That her habitation might not be cut off, / According to all that I have appointed concerning her. / But they rose up early to corrupt / All their deeds.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore wait on Me, declares Jehovah, / For the day when I rise up to the prey. / For My decision is to assemble the nations, / To gather kingdoms together, / That I may pour out upon them My wrath, / All My burning anger; / For in the fire of My jealousy / All the earth will be devoured.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> For then I will change <I>the language</I> of the peoples / Into a pure language / That they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, / To serve Him with one accord.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, / The daughter of My dispersed, will bring My meal offering.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day you will not be put to shame because of all your deeds, / By which you have transgressed against Me; / For then I will take away from your midst / Those who exult in your majesty, / And you will never again be haughty / On My holy mountain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will leave in the midst of you / An afflicted and poor people, / And they will take refuge in the name of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> The remnant of Israel will not do wrong; / And they will not speak lies, / Nor will there be found in their mouth / A deceitful tongue; / For they will have pasture and lie down, / And there will be no one to frighten <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Give a ringing shout, O daughter of Zion! / Shout in triumph, O Israel! / Rejoice and exult with all your heart, / O daughter of Jerusalem!<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed at that time / I will deal with all who afflict you; / And I will save that which is lame, / And that which has been driven away I will gather. / And I will make them a praise and a name / In every land where their shame had been.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:20">&nbsp;3:20 &nbsp;</A></B> At that time I will bring you in, / And at that time I will gather you; / For I will cause you to be a name and a praise / Among all the peoples of the earth, / When I turn again your captivity before your eyes, / Says Jehovah.<BR>
