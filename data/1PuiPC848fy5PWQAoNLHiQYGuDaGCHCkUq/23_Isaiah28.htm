</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:1">28:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim / And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, / Which is at the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome by wine.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:2">28:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed the Lord has someone strong and mighty; / As a hailstorm <I>and</I> a tempest of destruction, / As a storm of mighty overflowing waters, / He will cast down to the earth with <I>His</I> hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:3">28:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim / Will be trodden under foot;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:4">28:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And the fading flower of its glorious beauty, / Which is at the head of the fat valley, / Will be like the first-ripe <I>fig</I> before the summer, / Which when someone looks upon it he sees it, / <I>And</I> in an instant it is in his hand, and he swallows it up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:5">28:5 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day Jehovah of hosts / Will become a crown of beauty and a diadem of glory to the remnant of His people,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:6">28:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment / And strength to those who turn away the battle at the gate.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:7">28:7 &nbsp;</A></B> But these also reel with wine / And stagger from liquor: / The priest and the prophet stagger from liquor; / They are swallowed up with wine; / They stagger from liquor, / They reel in <I>their</I> visions, / They totter in <I>their</I> judgments.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:8">28:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For all the tables are full of vomit <I>and</I> filth; / There is no place <I>clean.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:9">28:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Whom will he teach knowledge? / And whom will he instruct with the report? / Those weaned from milk? / Those drawn from the breasts?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:10">28:10&nbsp;</A></B> For <I>his words are:</I> Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; / Line upon line, line upon line; / Here a little, there a little.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:11">28:11&nbsp;</A></B> For with stammering lips / And with a foreign tongue / He will speak to this people,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:12">28:12&nbsp;</A></B> He who said to them, / This is rest; give rest to the weary; / And, This is repose. / But they would not hear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:13">28:13&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore Jehovah’s word to them will be: / Rule upon rule, rule upon rule; / Line upon line, line upon line; / Here a little, there a little; / That they may go and stumble backward, / And be broken, snared, and taken.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:14">28:14&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, / You scoffing men, / Who rule this people / Who are in Jerusalem:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:15">28:15&nbsp;</A></B> Because you have said, We have made / A covenant with death, / And with Sheol / We have made an agreement: / When the overflowing scourge passes through, / It will not come upon us; / For we have made falsehood our refuge / And have hidden ourselves in deception.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:16">28:16&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore thus says / The Lord Jehovah: / Indeed I lay a stone in Zion as a foundation, / A tested stone, / A precious cornerstone <I>as a</I> foundation firmly established; / He who believes will not hasten away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:17">28:17&nbsp;</A></B> And I will make justice the line / And righteousness the plummet; / And the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, / And the waters will overflow the secret place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:18">28:18&nbsp;</A></B> And your covenant with death will be annulled, / And your agreement with Sheol will not stand; / When the overflowing scourge passes through, / You will be a trampling ground to it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:19">28:19&nbsp;</A></B> As often as it passes through, / It will take hold of you. / For morning by morning it will pass through, / By day and by night; / And it will be nothing but terror / To understand the report <I>of it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:20">28:20&nbsp;</A></B> For the bed is too short for a man to stretch on, / And the sheet is too narrow for him to wrap himself in.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:21">28:21&nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah will rise as on Mount Perazim, / He will be agitated as in the valley of Gibeon, / To do His deed, His strange deed, / And to do His work, His most different work.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:22">28:22&nbsp;</A></B> Now therefore do not be mockers, / Lest your fetters become stronger; / For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Of complete and decisive destruction upon the whole earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:23">28:23&nbsp;</A></B> Hearken and hear my voice; / Attend and hear my speech.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:24">28:24&nbsp;</A></B> Does the plowman plow all day long to sow his seed? / Does he open and harrow his ground <I>continually?</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:25">28:25&nbsp;</A></B> Does he not, once he levels the surface, / Scatter dill and broadcast cummin, / And put the wheat in rows and the barley in <I>its</I> appointed place / And the rye where it belongs?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:26">28:26&nbsp;</A></B> For his God instructs him toward <I>such</I> discretion / And teaches him <I>so.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:27">28:27&nbsp;</A></B> For dill is not threshed with a sharp tool, / Nor is the cart wheel turned upon the cummin; / But dill is beaten out with a rod, / And cummin with a stick.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:28">28:28&nbsp;</A></B> Bread grains are ground, / Yet one does not thresh and thresh forever. / And once the wheel of his cart and his horses drive over <I>it,</I> / One does not grind it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:29">28:29&nbsp;</A></B> This also comes forth from Jehovah of hosts, / He who makes <I>His</I> counsel extraordinary and <I>His</I> sound wisdom great.<BR>
