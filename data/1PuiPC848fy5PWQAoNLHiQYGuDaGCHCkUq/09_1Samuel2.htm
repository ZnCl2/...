</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:1">&nbsp;2:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And Hannah prayed and said: / My heart exults in Jehovah; / My horn is exalted in Jehovah; / My mouth is enlarged against my enemies, / Because I rejoice in Your salvation.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> There is none holy like Jehovah, / For there is none besides You; / Nor is there a rock like our God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Talk no more so very proudly; / Do not let arrogance go forth from your mouth; / For Jehovah is a God of knowledge, / And actions are weighed by Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:4">&nbsp;2:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The bows of the mighty men are broken, / And those who stumbled are girded with strength.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:5">&nbsp;2:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Those who were full have hired themselves out for food, / And those who were hungry are not so any longer. / She who was barren has borne seven, / And she who had many children languishes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:6">&nbsp;2:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah kills and makes alive; / He brings down to Sheol and brings up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:7">&nbsp;2:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah makes poor and makes rich; / He makes low and also lifts up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:8">&nbsp;2:8 &nbsp;</A></B> He raises the poor from the dust, / From the ash heap He lifts the needy, / That He may seat <I>them</I> with princes / And cause <I>them</I> to inherit the throne of glory. / For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s, / And He has set the world upon them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He will keep the feet of His faithful ones, / But the wicked will be silenced in darkness; / For not by strength shall any man prevail.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:10">&nbsp;2:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Those who strive with Jehovah will be shattered; / Against them He will thunder in heaven. / Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; / And He will give strength to His king / And exalt the horn of His anointed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:11">&nbsp;2:11 &nbsp;</A></B> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to Jehovah before Eli the priest.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:12">&nbsp;2:12 &nbsp;</A></B> Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they did not know Jehovah,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:13">&nbsp;2:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Nor <I>did they regard</I> the priests’ rightful due with the people. When any man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s attendant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the flesh was boiling,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:14">&nbsp;2:14 &nbsp;</A></B> And he would thrust <I>it</I> into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot; all that the fork brought up, the priest took with it. Thus they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:15">&nbsp;2:15 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed before they burned the fat, the priest’s attendant would come and say to the man sacrificing, Give some flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not accept boiled flesh from you, but only raw.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:16">&nbsp;2:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And if the man said to him, Let them burn up the fat first, then take as much as your soul desires; he would say, No, but you shall give <I>it</I> now; otherwise, I will take <I>it</I> by force.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:17">&nbsp;2:17 &nbsp;</A></B> And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:18">&nbsp;2:18 &nbsp;</A></B> And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, as a boy wearing a linen ephod.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:19">&nbsp;2:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And his mother would make him a little robe and bring <I>it</I> up to him yearly when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:20">&nbsp;2:20 &nbsp;</A></B> And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, May Jehovah give you seed by this woman in place of the one she requested of Jehovah; and they would go back to their place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:21">&nbsp;2:21 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:22">&nbsp;2:22 &nbsp;</A></B> Now Eli was very old, and he heard of all that his sons did to all Israel and how they lay with the women who were engaged in service at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:23">&nbsp;2:23 &nbsp;</A></B> And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:24">&nbsp;2:24 &nbsp;</A></B> No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear Jehovah’s people spreading.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:25">&nbsp;2:25 &nbsp;</A></B> If one man sins against another man, God will arbitrate for him; but if a man sins against Jehovah, who will arbitrate for him? But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was pleased to kill them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:26">&nbsp;2:26 &nbsp;</A></B> And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor both with Jehovah and with men.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:27">&nbsp;2:27 &nbsp;</A></B> And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, I revealed Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt as slaves to Pharaoh’s house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:28">&nbsp;2:28 &nbsp;</A></B> And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, <I>and</I> to wear the ephod before Me. And I gave the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:29">&nbsp;2:29 &nbsp;</A></B> Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and My offering, which I have commanded in <I>My</I> habitation, and honor your sons more than Me by making yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:30">&nbsp;2:30 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore Jehovah the God of Israel declares, I surely said that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever; but now Jehovah declares, Far be it from Me; for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who spurn Me will be lightly esteemed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:31">&nbsp;2:31 &nbsp;</A></B> The days are now coming when I will cut off your arm and the arm of the house of your father, so that there will not be an old man in your house.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:32">&nbsp;2:32 &nbsp;</A></B> And you shall see the distress of <I>My</I> habitation in the midst of all the good that I will do to Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:33">&nbsp;2:33 &nbsp;</A></B> And <I>that</I> man of yours whom I do not cut off from My altar <I>shall be left</I> to consume your eyes and to grieve your soul, and all the increase of your house shall die by the swords of men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:34">&nbsp;2:34 &nbsp;</A></B> And this will be the sign to you, which will come upon your two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: In one day both of them shall die.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:35">&nbsp;2:35 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he will go before My anointed continually.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:36">&nbsp;2:36 &nbsp;</A></B> And everyone who is left of your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and for a loaf of bread, and will say, Please put me in one of the priests’ offices that I may eat a morsel of bread.<BR>
