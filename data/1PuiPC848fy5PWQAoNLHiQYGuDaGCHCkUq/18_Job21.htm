</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:1">21:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job answered and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:2">21:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen carefully to my word, / And let this be your consolations.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:3">21:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Bear with me, and I will speak; / And after I have spoken, mock on.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:4">21:4 &nbsp;</A></B> As for me, is my complaint to man? / And why should my spirit not be impatient?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:5">21:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Look at me and be appalled; / And put <I>your</I> hand over <I>your</I> mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:6">21:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Even when I remember, I am troubled, / And horror takes hold of my flesh.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:7">21:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Why do the wicked live, / Grow old, even become mighty in riches?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:8">21:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Their seed is established with them in their sight, / And their offspring, before their eyes.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:9">21:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Their houses are free from dread, / And the rod of God is not upon them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:10">21:10&nbsp;</A></B> Their bull breeds and does not fail; / Their cow calves and does not miscarry.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:11">21:11&nbsp;</A></B> They send forth their little ones like a herd, / And their children dance.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:12">21:12&nbsp;</A></B> They lift up <I>their voices</I> to the tambourine and lyre, / And they rejoice at the sound of the flute.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:13">21:13&nbsp;</A></B> They spend their days in prosperity, / And in a moment they go down into Sheol.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:14">21:14&nbsp;</A></B> And they say unto God, Depart from us, / For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:15">21:15&nbsp;</A></B> What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? / And what profit is there, that we should pray to Him?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:16">21:16&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, their prosperity is not in their own hand. / The counsel of the wicked is far from Him.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:17">21:17&nbsp;</A></B> How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, / So that their calamity comes upon them, / So that God distributes sorrows in His anger?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:18">21:18&nbsp;</A></B> Do they become like straw before the wind / And like chaff that the storm carries off?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:19">21:19&nbsp;</A></B> <I>You say,</I> God stores up <I>the punishment of</I> his iniquity for his children. / <I>I say,</I> Let Him recompense him, so that he knows <I>it.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:20">21:20&nbsp;</A></B> Let his eyes see his destruction, / And let him drink the wrath of the Almighty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:21">21:21&nbsp;</A></B> For what is there for him to delight in, in his house after him, / When the number of his months is cut off?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:22">21:22&nbsp;</A></B> Will someone teach knowledge to God, / Seeing that He judges those who are on high?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:23">21:23&nbsp;</A></B> One dies in his full strength, / Being completely at ease and quiet;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:24">21:24&nbsp;</A></B> His pails are full of milk, / And the marrow of his bones is moist.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:25">21:25&nbsp;</A></B> But another dies in bitterness of soul / And does not taste of good.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:26">21:26&nbsp;</A></B> They lie down alike in the dust, / And the worm covers them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:27">21:27&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I know your thoughts, / And the devices by which you would wrong me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:28">21:28&nbsp;</A></B> For you say, Where is the house of the prince? / Where is the tent of the dwellings of the wicked?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:29">21:29&nbsp;</A></B> Have you not asked those who travel the roads? / And do you not regard their evidence,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:30">21:30&nbsp;</A></B> That the wicked man is spared in the day of calamity, / <I>That</I> they are led forth at the day of overflowing wrath?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:31">21:31&nbsp;</A></B> Who will declare his way to his face? / And who will repay him what he has done?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:32">21:32&nbsp;</A></B> When he is borne to the grave, / A watch is kept over the tomb.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:33">21:33&nbsp;</A></B> The clods of the valley are sweet to him; / And all men go in procession after him, / And <I>those who went</I> before him are without number.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="21:34">21:34&nbsp;</A></B> Why then do you comfort me with vanity? / For your responses leave <I>only</I> falsehood behind.<BR>
