</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:1">49:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Listen to me, O coastlands, / And hearken, you peoples from afar. / Jehovah has called me from the womb; / From the bowels of my mother He has made mention of my name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:2">49:2 &nbsp;</A></B> And He has made my mouth like a sharp sword; / He has concealed me in the shadow of His hand, / And He has made me a polished arrow; / He has hidden me in His quiver.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:3">49:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And He said to me, You are My servant, / Israel, in whom I will be glorified.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:4">49:4 &nbsp;</A></B> But I said, I have labored in vain; / I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity; / Yet surely the justice <I>due</I> to me is with Jehovah, / And my recompense with my God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:5">49:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And now says Jehovah, / Who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, / To bring Jacob back to Him, / So that Israel would be gathered to Him; / And I will be glorified in the sight of Jehovah, / And My God will be My strength.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:6">49:6 &nbsp;</A></B> He says, It is too small a thing that You would be My Servant / To raise up the tribes of Jacob / And bring back the preserved of Israel; / I will also set You as a light of the nations / That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:7">49:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / The Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, / To the despised One, the One abhorred by the nation, / The One subjected to tyrants, / Kings will see and arise, / And princes will bow down; / Because of Jehovah, who is faithful, / The Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:8">49:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / In an acceptable time I have answered You, / And in a day of salvation I have helped You; / And I will preserve You and give You for a covenant of the people, / To restore the land, to apportion the desolate inheritances,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:9">49:9 &nbsp;</A></B> To say to the prisoners, Come forth, / <I>To say</I> to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves.<BR>

They will feed along the roads, / And their pasture will be on all the bare heights;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:10">49:10&nbsp;</A></B> They will not hunger or thirst; / Neither the scorching heat nor the sun will strike them; / For He who has compassion on them will lead them / And will guide them beside the springs of water;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:11">49:11&nbsp;</A></B> And I will make all My mountains into a road, / And My highways will be raised up.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:12">49:12&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, these will come from a distance, / And indeed these <I>will come</I> from the north and the west, / And these from the land of the Sinim.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:13">49:13&nbsp;</A></B> Give a ringing shout, O heavens, and exult, O earth, / And break forth into shouting, O mountains; / For Jehovah has comforted His people / And will have compassion on His afflicted ones.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:14">49:14&nbsp;</A></B> But Zion has said, Jehovah has forsaken me, / And the Lord has forgotten me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:15">49:15&nbsp;</A></B> Can a woman forget her nursing child, / That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb? / Even though they may forget, / Yet I will not forget you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:16">49:16&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I have engraved you upon the palms <I>of My hands;</I> / Your walls are continually before Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:17">49:17&nbsp;</A></B> Your children make haste; / Your destroyers and those who lay you waste / Will go forth from you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:18">49:18&nbsp;</A></B> Lift up your eyes and look around; / All of these gather themselves together and come to you. / As I live, declares Jehovah, / You will put all of them on like an ornament / And gird <I>yourself</I> with them like a bride.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:19">49:19&nbsp;</A></B> For your waste and desolate <I>places</I> / And your devastated land&nbsp;— / For you will be too constricted now because of its inhabitants, / And those who swallowed you up will be far away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:20">49:20&nbsp;</A></B> The children of whom you were bereaved / Will yet say in your ears, / This place is too constricted for me; / Make room for me that I may dwell <I>here.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:21">49:21&nbsp;</A></B> Then you will say in your heart, / Who has borne these for me, / Since I have been bereaved <I>of children</I> and am barren, / An exile and driven about? / And who brought these up? / Indeed, I was left alone; / From where did these <I>come?</I><BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:22">49:22&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says the Lord Jehovah, / Indeed, I will lift up My hand to the nations, / And unto the peoples I will lift up My banner; / And they will bring your sons in their arms, / And they will carry your daughters on their shoulders.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:23">49:23&nbsp;</A></B> And kings will be your foster fathers; / And their princesses will be those who nurse you; / They will bow down to you with their faces toward the earth / And lick the dust of your feet; / And you will know that I am Jehovah; / Those who wait on Me will not be ashamed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:24">49:24&nbsp;</A></B> Can the booty be taken from the strong man, / Or the lawful captives be delivered?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:25">49:25&nbsp;</A></B> Surely, thus says Jehovah, / Even the captive may be taken from the strong man, / And the booty may be released from the tyrant; / For I will strive with those who strive with you, / And I will save your children;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="49:26">49:26&nbsp;</A></B> And I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; / And they will be drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine; / Then all flesh will know / That I am Jehovah your Savior / And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.<BR>
