</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:11">26:11&nbsp;</A></B> And you and the Levite and the sojourner in your midst shall rejoice in all the good which Jehovah your God has given to you and to your household.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:12">26:12&nbsp;</A></B> When you have finished giving all the tithes of your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give <I>it</I> to the Levite, the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates and be satisfied.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:13">26:13&nbsp;</A></B> And you shall say before Jehovah your God, I have removed what is holy from out of my house, and I have also given it to the Levite and the sojourner, to the orphan and the widow, according to Your whole commandment, which You have commanded me; I have not transgressed any of Your commandments and I have not forgotten <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="26:14">26:14&nbsp;</A></B> I have not eaten any of it in my sorrow, nor have I removed any of it while <I>I was</I> unclean, nor have I given any of it to the dead.
