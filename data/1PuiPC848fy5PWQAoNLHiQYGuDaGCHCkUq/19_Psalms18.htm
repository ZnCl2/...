</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:1">18:1 &nbsp;</A></B> I love You, O Jehovah, my strength.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:2">18:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah is my crag and my fortress and my Deliverer; / My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; / My shield and the horn of my salvation, my high retreat.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:3">18:3 &nbsp;</A></B> I called upon Jehovah, who is worthy of praise,<BR>
 And from my enemies I was saved.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:4">18:4 &nbsp;</A></B> The cords of death encompassed me; / And the torrents of destruction assailed me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:5">18:5 &nbsp;</A></B> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; / The snares of death confronted me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:6">18:6 &nbsp;</A></B> In my distress I called upon Jehovah / And cried out to my God. / He heard my voice from His temple, / And my cry before Him came to His ears.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:7">18:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the earth shook and quaked, / And the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook about, / For He was furious.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:8">18:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Smoke went up from His nostrils, / And fire from His mouth devoured; / Coals blazed forth from Him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:9">18:9 &nbsp;</A></B> He bowed the heavens and descended, / And deep darkness was under His feet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:10">18:10&nbsp;</A></B> He rode upon a cherub and did fly; / He darted upon the wings of the wind.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:11">18:11&nbsp;</A></B> He made darkness His hiding place, His pavilion around Him: / Dark waterclouds, thick clouds of the skies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:12">18:12&nbsp;</A></B> Out of the brightness before Him there broke through His clouds / Hail and fiery coals.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:13">18:13&nbsp;</A></B> Then Jehovah thundered in heaven, / And the Most High uttered His voice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:14">18:14&nbsp;</A></B> And He sent forth His arrows and scattered my enemies; / And He shot forth lightning bolts and discomfited them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:15">18:15&nbsp;</A></B> The channels of the sea were seen, / And the foundations of the habitable land were laid bare / At Your rebuke, O Jehovah, / At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:16">18:16&nbsp;</A></B> He reached forth from on high; He took me; / He drew me out of great waters.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:17">18:17&nbsp;</A></B> He delivered me from my strong enemy / And from those who hate me, for they were too mighty for me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:18">18:18&nbsp;</A></B> They confronted me in the day of my calamity, / But Jehovah became my support.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:19">18:19&nbsp;</A></B> He brought me forth to a place broad and free; / He rescued me, for He took delight in me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:20">18:20&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness; / According to the cleanness of my hands He has repaid me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:21">18:21&nbsp;</A></B> For I have kept the ways of Jehovah / And have not acted wickedly <I>by turning</I> away from my God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:22">18:22&nbsp;</A></B> For all His judgments were before me, / And I did not turn His statutes away from me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:23">18:23&nbsp;</A></B> I was perfect toward Him, / And I kept myself from my iniquity.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:24">18:24&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore Jehovah recompensed me according to my righteousness, / According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:27">18:27&nbsp;</A></B> For it is You who save the afflicted people, / But the haughty eyes You bring down;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:28">18:28&nbsp;</A></B> For it is You who light my lamp; / Jehovah my God lights up my darkness;<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:33">18:33&nbsp;</A></B> Who makes my feet like hinds’ <I>feet</I> / And sets me on my high places,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:34">18:34&nbsp;</A></B> Who teaches my hands to wage war / So that my arms may bend a bronze bow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:35">18:35&nbsp;</A></B> And You have given me the shield of Your salvation, / And Your right hand supports me; / And Your condescending gentleness has made me great.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:36">18:36&nbsp;</A></B> You have broadened the places of my steps under me, / And my feet have not slipped.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:37">18:37&nbsp;</A></B> I pursued my enemies and overtook them, / And I did not turn back until they were consumed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:38">18:38&nbsp;</A></B> I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise up; / They fell under my feet.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:39">18:39&nbsp;</A></B> And You girded me with strength for war; / You brought down under me those who rose up against me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:40">18:40&nbsp;</A></B> You also made my enemies turn <I>their</I> back to me, / And I annihilated those who hated me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:41">18:41&nbsp;</A></B> They cried out, but there was no one to save <I>them;</I> / <I>They cried out</I> to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:42">18:42&nbsp;</A></B> Then I beat them like dust before the wind; / Like the mud of the streets I pounded them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:43">18:43&nbsp;</A></B> You rescued me from the strivings of the people; / You have made me the head of the nations; / A people whom I had not known serves me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:44">18:44&nbsp;</A></B> At the <I>mere</I> hearing of a report, they obey me; / Foreigners come cringing to me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:45">18:45&nbsp;</A></B> Foreigners are discouraged / And come quaking out of their fortresses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:46">18:46&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah lives; and blessed be my rock, / And exalted be the God of my salvation,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:48">18:48&nbsp;</A></B> Who rescues me from my enemies. / Indeed You exalted me above those who rise up against me; / From the violent man You delivered me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:49">18:49&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore I give thanks to You among the nations, O Jehovah; / And I will sing psalms to Your name.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:50">18:50&nbsp;</A></B> <I>It is He</I> who magnifies salvation to His king / And executes lovingkindness to His anointed, / To David and to his seed forever.<BR>
