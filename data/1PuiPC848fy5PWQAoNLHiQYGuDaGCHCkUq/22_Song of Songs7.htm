</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:4">&nbsp;7:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Your neck is like a tower of ivory; / Your eyes, <I>like</I> the pools in Heshbon / By the gate of Bath-rabbim; / Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, / Which faces Damascus.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:5">&nbsp;7:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Your head upon you is like Carmel, / And the locks of your head like purple. / The king is fettered by <I>your</I> tresses.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:9">&nbsp;7:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And the roof of your mouth like the best wine&nbsp;— <BR>

 Going down smoothly for my beloved, / Gliding through the lips of those who sleep.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> The mandrakes give forth fragrance, / And over our doors are all choice fruits, / New as well as old. / <I>These,</I> my beloved, I have stored up for you.<BR>
