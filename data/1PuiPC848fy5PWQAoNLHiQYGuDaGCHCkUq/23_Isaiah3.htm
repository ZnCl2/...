</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:1">&nbsp;3:1 &nbsp;</A></B> For now the Lord Jehovah of hosts / Is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah / Every kind of support&nbsp;— / All the support of bread / And all the support of water;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:2">&nbsp;3:2 &nbsp;</A></B> The mighty man and the man of war, / The judge and the prophet, / And the diviner and the elder;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:3">&nbsp;3:3 &nbsp;</A></B> The captain of fifty and the highly regarded; / And the counselor, the wise magician, and the knowledgeable enchanter.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:4">&nbsp;3:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And I will make youths their rulers, / And capriciousness will rule over them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:5">&nbsp;3:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And the people will be oppressed, each by the other, / And each by his neighbor. / The youth will be arrogant to the elder, / And the contemned one to the one who is honored.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:6">&nbsp;3:6 &nbsp;</A></B> When a man takes hold of his brother / In his father’s house <I>and says,</I> / You have clothing, you be our ruler, / And these ruins will be under your hand;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:7">&nbsp;3:7 &nbsp;</A></B> He will solemnly say, / I will not be the one who binds <I>your wounds,</I> / For in my house there is no food or clothing; / Do not appoint me as ruler of the people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:8">&nbsp;3:8 &nbsp;</A></B> For Jerusalem stumbles, / And Judah falls, / Because their speech and their actions are against Jehovah, / To rebel against the eyes of His glory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:9">&nbsp;3:9 &nbsp;</A></B> The countenance of their faces witnesses against them, / And they declare their sin like Sodom; / They do not hide it. / Woe to their soul! / For they have brought evil upon themselves.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:10">&nbsp;3:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Say to the righteous that <I>it will go</I> well <I>with them,</I> / For they will eat the fruit of their actions.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:11">&nbsp;3:11 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to the wicked man! <I>It will go</I> badly <I>with him;</I> / For the result of his deeds will be done to him<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:12">&nbsp;3:12 &nbsp;</A></B> My people&nbsp;— their oppressors are children, / And women rule over them. / O My people, those who lead you are leading you astray; / And the path for your ways they have hidden.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:13">&nbsp;3:13 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah stands firm to contend, / And He stands to judge the people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:14">&nbsp;3:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah will enter into judgment / With the elders of His people and their rulers. / <I>It is</I> you <I>who</I> have consumed the vineyard; / The spoil of the poor is in your houses.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:15">&nbsp;3:15 &nbsp;</A></B> What do you mean by crushing My people / And grinding the faces of the poor? / Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:16">&nbsp;3:16 &nbsp;</A></B> Moreover Jehovah said, / Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, / And walk around with outstretched necks / And lusting eyes, / And trip along with quick, little steps, / And rattle the anklets on their feet;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:17">&nbsp;3:17 &nbsp;</A></B> The Lord will strike the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, / And Jehovah will expose their secret parts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:18">&nbsp;3:18 &nbsp;</A></B> In that day the Lord will remove the beauty of <I>their</I> anklets, headbands, and crescents;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:19">&nbsp;3:19 &nbsp;</A></B> The ear pendants, the bracelets, and the costly veils;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:20">&nbsp;3:20 &nbsp;</A></B> The headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the bottles of aromas, and the amulets;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:21">&nbsp;3:21 &nbsp;</A></B> The <I>finger</I> rings and the nose rings;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:22">&nbsp;3:22 &nbsp;</A></B> The formal gowns, the frocks, the wraps, and the purses;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:23">&nbsp;3:23 &nbsp;</A></B> The mirrors, the fine linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:24">&nbsp;3:24 &nbsp;</A></B> And instead of a sweet smell there will be rottenness; / And instead of a belt, an encircling rope; / Instead of well-set hair, baldness; / And instead of fine garments, the girding of oneself with sackcloth; / A brand instead of beauty.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:25">&nbsp;3:25 &nbsp;</A></B> Your men will fall by the sword, / And your mighty, in battle;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="3:26">&nbsp;3:26 &nbsp;</A></B> Then her gates will mourn and lament, / And she, being desolated, will sit on the ground.<BR>
