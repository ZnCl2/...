</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="23:14">23:14&nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah your God walks in the midst of your camp to rescue you and deliver up your enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy, and He must not see any indecent thing among you, lest He turn back from <I>going</I> after you.<BR>
