</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:1">28:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the sight of Jehovah as David his father <I>had done,</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:2">28:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made molten images for the Baals.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:3">28:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom and burned his children in fire, according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:4">28:4 &nbsp;</A></B> And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places and on the hills and under every flourishing tree.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:5">28:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they struck him and carried away captive from him a great multitude. And they brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, and he struck a great blow on him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:6">28:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew one hundred twenty thousand in Judah on one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah, the God of their fathers.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:7">28:7 &nbsp;</A></B> And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah, the king’s son, and Azrikam, the ruler of the house, and Elkanah, who was second to the king.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:8">28:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And the children of Israel carried away captive two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters of their brothers, and also plundered much spoil from them; and they brought the spoil to Samaria.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:9">28:9 &nbsp;</A></B> But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army that was coming to Samaria and said to them, Now, because Jehovah, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, He has given them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:10">28:10&nbsp;</A></B> And now you intend to subjugate the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your male and female slaves. Is there not even with you anything but trespasses against Jehovah your God?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:11">28:11&nbsp;</A></B> Now therefore listen to me, and return the captives that you have carried away captive from among your brothers, for the burning anger of Jehovah is upon you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:12">28:12&nbsp;</A></B> Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan <I>and</I> Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum and Amasa the son of Hadlai, rose up against those coming from the war;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:13">28:13&nbsp;</A></B> And they said to them, You shall not bring the captives here, for you intend to bring a trespass against Jehovah upon us to add to our sins and our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is burning anger upon Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:14">28:14&nbsp;</A></B> So the soldiers left the captives and the plunder before the leaders and all the assembly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:15">28:15&nbsp;</A></B> And those men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them. And they clothed them and gave them sandals and fed them and gave them something to drink, and they anointed them and carried all the feeble among them on asses and brought them to Jericho, the city of palms, to their brothers. And they returned to Samaria.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:16">28:16&nbsp;</A></B> At that time King Ahaz sent <I>word</I> to the kings of Assyria to help him,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:17">28:17&nbsp;</A></B> For again the Edomites came and struck Judah and carried away captives.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:18">28:18&nbsp;</A></B> And the Philistines raided the cities of the lowlands and the south of Judah and took Beth-shemesh and Aijalon and Gederoth and Soco with its villages and Timnah with its villages and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:19">28:19&nbsp;</A></B> For Jehovah humbled Judah on account of Ahaz the king of Israel, for he cast off restraint in Judah and trespassed greatly against Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:20">28:20&nbsp;</A></B> And Tilgath-pilneser the king of Assyria came against him and distressed him and did not strengthen him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:21">28:21&nbsp;</A></B> For Ahaz took away a portion of the house of Jehovah and of the house of the king and the officials and gave it to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:22">28:22&nbsp;</A></B> And at the time of his distress, he added to his trespass against Jehovah, this same King Ahaz;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:23">28:23&nbsp;</A></B> For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which had struck him, for he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, to them will I sacrifice, so that they will help me. But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:24">28:24&nbsp;</A></B> And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut the vessels of the house of God into pieces, and he shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah and made himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:25">28:25&nbsp;</A></B> And in every city of Judah he made high places for burning incense to other gods and provoked Jehovah, the God of his fathers, to anger.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:26">28:26&nbsp;</A></B> Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, the first and the last, are there written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="28:27">28:27&nbsp;</A></B> And Ahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him to the tombs of the kings of Israel.<BR>

And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.<BR>
