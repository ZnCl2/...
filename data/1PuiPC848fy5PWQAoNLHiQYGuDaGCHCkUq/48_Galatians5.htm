</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:1">&nbsp;5:1 &nbsp;</A></B> <I>It is</I> for freedom <I>that</I> Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:2">&nbsp;5:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:3">&nbsp;5:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:4">&nbsp;5:4 &nbsp;</A></B> You have been brought to nought, <I>separated</I> from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:5">&nbsp;5:5 &nbsp;</A></B> For we by the Spirit out of faith eagerly await the hope of righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:6">&nbsp;5:6 &nbsp;</A></B> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith <I>avails,</I> operating through love.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:7">&nbsp;5:7 &nbsp;</A></B> You were running well. Who hindered you that you would not believe and obey the truth?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:8">&nbsp;5:8 &nbsp;</A></B> This persuasion is not of Him who calls you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:9">&nbsp;5:9 &nbsp;</A></B> A little leaven leavens the whole lump.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:10">&nbsp;5:10 &nbsp;</A></B> I am confident in the Lord concerning you that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:11">&nbsp;5:11 &nbsp;</A></B> But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been annulled.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:12">&nbsp;5:12 &nbsp;</A></B> I wish that those upsetting you would even cut themselves off.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:13">&nbsp;5:13 &nbsp;</A></B> For you were called for freedom, brothers; only do not <I>turn</I> this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:14">&nbsp;5:14 &nbsp;</A></B> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:15">&nbsp;5:15 &nbsp;</A></B> But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:16">&nbsp;5:16 &nbsp;</A></B> But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:17">&nbsp;5:17 &nbsp;</A></B> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:18">&nbsp;5:18 &nbsp;</A></B> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:19">&nbsp;5:19 &nbsp;</A></B> And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:20">&nbsp;5:20 &nbsp;</A></B> Idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:21">&nbsp;5:21 &nbsp;</A></B> Envyings, bouts of drunkenness, carousings, and things like these, of which I tell you beforehand, even as I have said before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:22">&nbsp;5:22 &nbsp;</A></B> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:23">&nbsp;5:23 &nbsp;</A></B> Meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:24">&nbsp;5:24 &nbsp;</A></B> But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:25">&nbsp;5:25 &nbsp;</A></B> If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="5:26">&nbsp;5:26 &nbsp;</A></B> Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.<BR>
