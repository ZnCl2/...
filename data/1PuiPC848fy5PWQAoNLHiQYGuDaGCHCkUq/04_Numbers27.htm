</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:4">27:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Why should our father’s name be taken away from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:7">27:7 &nbsp;</A></B> The daughters of Zelophehad speak rightly. You shall surely give them the possession of an inheritance among their father’s brothers; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:11">27:11&nbsp;</A></B> And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his relative nearest to him among his family, and he shall possess it.

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:12">27:12&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go up to this mountain of the Abarim and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:13">27:13&nbsp;</A></B> And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was gathered,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:14">27:14&nbsp;</A></B> Because you rebelled against My word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the assembly, <I>and failed</I> to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin.)<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:15">27:15&nbsp;</A></B> And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying,<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:17">27:17&nbsp;</A></B> Who will go out before them and who will come in before them, and who will lead them out and who will bring them in; so that the assembly of Jehovah will not be like sheep which have no shepherd.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="27:18">27:18&nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand upon him;<BR>
