</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:1">31:1 &nbsp;</A></B> In You, O Jehovah, do I take refuge; / Never let me be put to shame. / Rescue me in Your righteousness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:2">31:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Incline Your ear to me; / Deliver me speedily. / Be to me a rock of protection, / A fortress, to save me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:3">31:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For You are my crag and my fortress; / Therefore for Your name’s sake / Lead me and guide me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:4">31:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Bring me out of the net / That they have secretly laid for me, / For You are my protection.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:5">31:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Into Your hand I commit my spirit; / Redeem me, O Jehovah, God of truth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:6">31:6 &nbsp;</A></B> I hate those who regard vanities of falsehood, / But I trust in Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:7">31:7 &nbsp;</A></B> I will exult and rejoice in Your lovingkindness, / Since You have seen my affliction; / You know the distress of my soul.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:8">31:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And You have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; / You have made my feet stand in a place broad and free.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:9">31:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Be gracious to me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress. / My eye is wasted away with grief, / <I>Indeed</I> my soul and body.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:10">31:10&nbsp;</A></B> For my life has been consumed in sorrow, / And my years, in sighing. / My strength fails because of my iniquity, / And my bones have wasted away.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:11">31:11&nbsp;</A></B> Because of all my adversaries, / I have become a reproach, / And especially so to my neighbors, / And something dreaded to my acquaintances; / Those who see me on the street flee from me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:12">31:12&nbsp;</A></B> I am forgotten, like a dead man out of mind; / I am like a destroyed vessel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:13">31:13&nbsp;</A></B> For I hear the slander of many; / Terror is on every side. / When they take counsel together against me, / They scheme to take my life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:14">31:14&nbsp;</A></B> But I trust in You, O Jehovah; / I say, You are my God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:15">31:15&nbsp;</A></B> My times are in Your hand; / Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who pursue me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:16">31:16&nbsp;</A></B> Cause Your face to shine upon Your servant; / Save me in Your lovingkindness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:17">31:17&nbsp;</A></B> O Jehovah, do not let me be put to shame when I call out to You; / Let the wicked be put to shame; let them be silent in Sheol.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:18">31:18&nbsp;</A></B> Let the lips of falsehood be made dumb, / Which speak arrogantly against the righteous / With pride and contempt.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:19">31:19&nbsp;</A></B> How great is Your goodness, / Which You have stored up for those who fear You, / Which You have accomplished in the sight of the sons of men / For those who take refuge in You!<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:20">31:20&nbsp;</A></B> You hide them in the hiding place of Your presence / Apart from the conspiracies of men; / You lay them away secretly in a shelter / Apart from the contention of tongues.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:21">31:21&nbsp;</A></B> Blessed be Jehovah, / For He displayed His lovingkindness wondrously / To me in a fortified city.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:22">31:22&nbsp;</A></B> I, on my part, had said in my alarm, / I am cut off before Your eyes; / But instead You heard / The voice of my supplications / When I cried out to You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:23">31:23&nbsp;</A></B> Love Jehovah, all <I>you who are</I> His faithful ones; / Jehovah guards the trustworthy, / And recompenses abundantly / Him who acts haughtily.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="31:24">31:24&nbsp;</A></B> Be strong, and let your heart be encouraged, / All you who hope in Jehovah.<BR>
