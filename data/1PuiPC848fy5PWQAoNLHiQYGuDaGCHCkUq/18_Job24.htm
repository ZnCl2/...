</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:5">24:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, <I>like</I> wild asses in the desert, / They go forth to their work, / Diligently seeking some prey; / The wilderness <I>provides</I> them food for their children.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:11">24:11&nbsp;</A></B> Between their walls they press out oil; / They tread the winepresses yet suffer thirst.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:12">24:12&nbsp;</A></B> From the city men groan, / And the soul of the wounded cries out; / Yet God does not regard the folly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:13">24:13&nbsp;</A></B> These are among those who rebel against the light; / They are not acquainted with its ways, / Nor do they abide in its paths.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:14">24:14&nbsp;</A></B> The murderer rises at dawn; / He kills the poor and the needy; / And at night he is like a thief.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:15">24:15&nbsp;</A></B> The eye of the adulterer also watches for the twilight, / Saying, Not an eye will see me; / And he disguises his face.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:16">24:16&nbsp;</A></B> They dig through houses in the dark; / By day they shut themselves in: / They do not know the light.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:17">24:17&nbsp;</A></B> For morning is to all of them <I>like</I> the shadow of death, / Because they are acquainted with the terrors of the shadow of death.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:18">24:18&nbsp;</A></B> Swift are they upon the face of the waters; / Their portion is cursed in the earth; / There is none who turns toward the vineyards.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:19">24:19&nbsp;</A></B> Drought and heat snatch the snow water, / <I>As</I> Sheol <I>snatches</I> those who have sinned.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:20">24:20&nbsp;</A></B> The womb forgets him; / The worm finds him sweet; / He is remembered no more; / And wrongdoing is broken like a tree.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:21">24:21&nbsp;</A></B> He despoils the barren woman who does not bear, / And does no good for the widow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:22">24:22&nbsp;</A></B> But <I>God</I> preserves the mighty by His power; / He arises, and no one is certain of life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:23">24:23&nbsp;</A></B> He grants a man to be secure, and he rests <I>on it;</I> / And His eyes are upon their ways.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:24">24:24&nbsp;</A></B> They are exalted a little while, then they are no more; / And they are brought low; like all <I>others,</I> they are gathered in / And are cut off like the tops of the ears of grain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:25">24:25&nbsp;</A></B> And if it is not so, then who will prove me a liar / And bring my words to nought?<BR>
