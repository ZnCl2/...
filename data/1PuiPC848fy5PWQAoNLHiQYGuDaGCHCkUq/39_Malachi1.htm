</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:1">&nbsp;1:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel through Malachi.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:2">&nbsp;1:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I have loved you, says Jehovah; but you say, How have You loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother, declares Jehovah? Yet I loved Jacob;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:3">&nbsp;1:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But Esau I hated, and I made his mountains a desolation, and <I>gave</I> his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:4">&nbsp;1:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Though Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build up the waste places; thus says Jehovah of hosts, They will build up, but I will throw down; and they will be called the territory of wickedness and the people with whom Jehovah is indignant forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:5">&nbsp;1:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And your eyes will see <I>it,</I> and you yourselves will say, Jehovah is magnified over the territory of Israel.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:6">&nbsp;1:6 &nbsp;</A></B> A son honors <I>his</I> father, and a servant his lord. Therefore if I am a Father, where is My honor? And if I am the Lord, where is My fear? says Jehovah of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, How have we despised Your name?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:7">&nbsp;1:7 &nbsp;</A></B> You offer defiled food upon My altar. And you say, How have we defiled You? In that you say, The table of Jehovah is despicable.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:8">&nbsp;1:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And when you offer what is blind as a sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you offer what is lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it, if you will, to your governor. Will he be pleased with you or accept your person? says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:9">&nbsp;1:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And now, if you will, entreat the favor of God, that He may be gracious to us. This is what is from your hand. Will He accept any of your persons? says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:10">&nbsp;1:10 &nbsp;</A></B> Oh, that there were even someone among you who would shut the doors so that you would not kindle <I>fire</I> on My altar in vain! I have no delight in you, says Jehovah of hosts; and I am not pleased with the sacrifice from your hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:11">&nbsp;1:11 &nbsp;</A></B> For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting My name will be great among the nations. And in every place incense will be offered to My name as well as a pure sacrifice, for My name will be great among the nations, says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:12">&nbsp;1:12 &nbsp;</A></B> But you profane it by saying, The table of the Lord is defiled, and the produce on it, its food, is despicable.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:13">&nbsp;1:13 &nbsp;</A></B> And you say, Ah, how tiresome it is! and sniff at it <I>in contempt,</I> says Jehovah of hosts. Then you bring what has been stolen and what is lame and what is sick, and you offer <I>it as</I> a sacrifice. Should I be pleased with what <I>comes</I> from your hand? says Jehovah.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="1:14">&nbsp;1:14 &nbsp;</A></B> Rather, cursed be the deceiver who has in his flock a male, and when he makes a vow, he offers what is blemished to the Lord; for I am a great King, says Jehovah of hosts, and My name is feared among the nations.<BR>
