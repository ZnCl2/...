</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:1">24:1 &nbsp;</A></B> When a man takes a woman and marries her, if she does not find favor in his sight, because he has found some indecency in her; and he writes her a bill of divorce and puts <I>it</I> in her hand and sends her away from his house;<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:3">24:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And the latter husband despises her and writes her a bill of divorce and puts <I>it</I> in her hand and sends her away from his house; or if the latter husband, who has taken her as his wife, dies;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:4">24:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Then the former husband, who sent her away, may not return to take her <I>again</I> to be his wife after she has been defiled.

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:5">24:5 &nbsp;</A></B> When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with the army, nor shall he be charged with any duty; he shall be free at home for one year, and he shall make his wife happy, whom he has taken.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:13">24:13&nbsp;</A></B> You must return his pledge to him when the sun goes down, so that he may sleep in his mantle and bless you; and it will be righteousness to you before Jehovah your God.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:14">24:14&nbsp;</A></B> You shall not oppress a poor and needy hired servant among your brothers or among the sojourners with you, who are in your land within your gates.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:15">24:15&nbsp;</A></B> On the day he <I>earns it,</I> you shall give <I>him</I> his wages, and the sun shall not go down upon it (for he is poor and his life depends on it); lest he cry against you to Jehovah and it become sin in you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:16">24:16&nbsp;</A></B> Fathers shall not be put to death because of <I>their</I> children, nor shall children be put to death because of <I>their</I> fathers; every man shall be put to death for his <I>own</I> sin.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:17">24:17&nbsp;</A></B> You shall not distort justice <I>due</I> a sojourner <I>or</I> an orphan, nor shall you take a widow’s garment as a pledge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:18">24:18&nbsp;</A></B> But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt and <I>that</I> Jehovah your God ransomed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="24:19">24:19&nbsp;</A></B> When you reap your harvest in your field and you forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not turn back to gather it; it shall be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow, in order that Jehovah your God may bless you in all your undertakings.<BR>
