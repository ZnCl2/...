</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:1">57:1 &nbsp;</A></B> The righteous man perishes, / And no one takes it to heart; / And godly men are being swept away, / While no one considers / That the righteous man is being swept away from evil.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:2">57:2 &nbsp;</A></B> He enters into peace; / They rest in their beds, / <I>Each</I> who walks uprightly.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:3">57:3 &nbsp;</A></B> But draw near here, / You children of a sorceress, / You seed of an adulterer and of her who prostitutes herself.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:4">57:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Whom are you mocking, / And against whom are you opening your mouth wide / And sticking out your tongue? / Are you not children of transgression, / A seed of falsehood,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:5">57:5 &nbsp;</A></B> Who inflame yourselves among the terebinths, / Under every flourishing tree, / Who slaughter the children in the valleys / Under the clefts of the rocks?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:6">57:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Among the smooth <I>stones</I> of the valley is your portion, / They, <I>yes,</I> they are your lot. / Indeed, to them you have poured out a drink offering, / You have offered a meal offering. / Shall I ease Myself of these?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:7">57:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Upon a high and lofty mountain / You have set your bed. / Indeed, you went up there / To offer sacrifice.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:8">57:8 &nbsp;</A></B> And behind the door and doorpost / You have put your reminder. / For apart from Me, you have uncovered yourself and gone up; / You have extended your bed; / And you have made an agreement for yourself with them; / You loved their bed; you saw <I>their</I> nakedness.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:9">57:9 &nbsp;</A></B> And you went to the king with oil, / And you increased your perfumes; / You sent your envoys far away / And debased yourself even as far as Sheol.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:10">57:10&nbsp;</A></B> You were wearied with the length of your way, / <I>Yet</I> you did not say, It is hopeless; / You found the renewing of your strength, / Therefore you did not weaken.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:11">57:11&nbsp;</A></B> And whom have you been worried about and feared, / That you have lied and not remembered Me, / Nor taken it to heart? / Was I not silent, and that for a long time, / Yet you did not fear Me?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:12">57:12&nbsp;</A></B> I will declare your righteousness / And your works, / Yet they will not profit you.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:13">57:13&nbsp;</A></B> When you cry out, let your heaps <I>of idols</I> deliver you. / But the wind will carry them all away; / A breath will take <I>them</I> away.<BR>

But he who takes refuge in Me will inherit the land / And possess My holy mountain.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:14">57:14&nbsp;</A></B> And it will be said, / Cast up, cast up; prepare the way; / Take up the obstacle out of the way of My people.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:15">57:15&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says the high and exalted One, / Who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: / I will dwell in the high and holy place, / And with the contrite and lowly of spirit, / To revive the spirit of the lowly / And to revive the heart of the contrite.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:16">57:16&nbsp;</A></B> For I will not contend forever, / Nor will I always be angry; / For the spirit would faint before Me, / And the souls which I have made.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:17">57:17&nbsp;</A></B> Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry, / And I struck him; I hid Myself and was angry; / And he went on, turning away in the way of his heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:18">57:18&nbsp;</A></B> I have seen his ways / And will heal him; / And I will lead him and restore comfort to him / <I>And</I> to his mourning ones,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:19">57:19&nbsp;</A></B> Creating the fruit of the lips: / Peace, peace to him who is far off and to him who is near, / Says Jehovah; and I will heal him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:20">57:20&nbsp;</A></B> But the wicked are like the tossed sea, / For it cannot be calm, / And its waters toss up mire and mud.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="57:21">57:21&nbsp;</A></B> There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked.<BR>
