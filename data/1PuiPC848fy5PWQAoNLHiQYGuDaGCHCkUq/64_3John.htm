</P><B><A NAME="1"><P class="verse">1 &nbsp;</A></B> The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truthfulness.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="2"><P class="verse">2 &nbsp;</A></B> Beloved, concerning all things I wish that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="3"><P class="verse">3 &nbsp;</A></B> For I rejoiced greatly at the brothers’ coming and testifying to your <I>steadfastness in the</I> truth, even as you walk in truth.<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="4"><P class="verse">4 &nbsp;</A></B> I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear that my children are walking in the truth.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="5"><P class="verse">5 &nbsp;</A></B> Beloved, you do faithfully in whatever you have wrought for the brothers, and this <I>for</I> strangers,<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="6"><P class="verse">6 &nbsp;</A></B> Who testified to your love before the church; whom you will do well to send forward in a manner worthy of God;<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="7"><P class="verse">7 &nbsp;</A></B> For on behalf of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="8"><P class="verse">8 &nbsp;</A></B> We therefore ought to support such ones that we may become fellow workers in the truth.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="9"><P class="verse">9 &nbsp;</A></B> I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="10"><P class="verse">10&nbsp;</A></B> For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those intending to <I>do so</I> he forbids and casts out of the church.<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="11"><P class="verse">11&nbsp;</A></B> Beloved, do not imitate the evil, but the good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="12"><P class="verse">12&nbsp;</A></B> To Demetrius testimony has been borne by all and by the truth itself; and we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.<BR> 

</P><B><A NAME="13"><P class="verse">13&nbsp;</A></B> I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with ink and pen;<BR> 
</P><B><A NAME="14"><P class="verse">14&nbsp;</A></B> But I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.<BR> 

Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.<BR>
