</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:1">73:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Surely God is good to Israel, / To those who are pure in heart.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:2">73:2 &nbsp;</A></B> But as for me, my feet were nearly turned aside; / My steps had almost slipped.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:3">73:3 &nbsp;</A></B> For I was envious of the arrogant, / <I>When</I> I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:4">73:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For they have no pangs in their death, / And their body is well nourished.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:5">73:5 &nbsp;</A></B> They do not <I>find themselves</I> in the hardship of men, / Nor are they plagued like <I>other</I> men.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:6">73:6 &nbsp;</A></B> Therefore pride is a necklace for them, / Violence covers them like a garment.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:7">73:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Their eyes bulge out from fatness; / The imaginations of <I>their</I> heart overflow.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:8">73:8 &nbsp;</A></B> They mock and wickedly speak of oppression; / They speak loftily.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:9">73:9 &nbsp;</A></B> They set their mouth against the heavens, / And their tongue walks about on the earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:10">73:10&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore His people return here, / And waters of abundance are drained by them;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:11">73:11&nbsp;</A></B> And they say, How does God know? / And is there knowledge with the Most High?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:12">73:12&nbsp;</A></B> Behold, these are the wicked; / And always at ease, they heap up riches.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:13">73:13&nbsp;</A></B> Surely I have purified my heart in vain, / And I have washed my hands in innocence.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:14">73:14&nbsp;</A></B> For I have been plagued all day long / And chastened every morning.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:15">73:15&nbsp;</A></B> If I had said, I will speak thus; / Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of Your children.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:16">73:16&nbsp;</A></B> When I considered this in order to understand <I>it,</I> / It was a troublesome task in my sight,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:17">73:17&nbsp;</A></B> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; / <I>Then</I> I perceived their end.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:18">73:18&nbsp;</A></B> Surely You set them in slippery places; / You cast them down into ruins.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:19">73:19&nbsp;</A></B> How they are made desolate in a moment! / They are utterly consumed by terrors.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:20">73:20&nbsp;</A></B> Like a dream, when one awakes, You, O Lord, / Upon arising, will despise their image.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:21">73:21&nbsp;</A></B> When my heart was embittered, / And inwardly I was pricked;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:22">73:22&nbsp;</A></B> I was brutish and knew nothing; / I was <I>like</I> a beast before You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:23">73:23&nbsp;</A></B> Nevertheless I am continually with You; / You have taken hold of my right hand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:24">73:24&nbsp;</A></B> You will guide me with Your counsel, / And afterward You will receive me in glory.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:25">73:25&nbsp;</A></B> Whom do I have in heaven <I>but You?</I> / And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:26">73:26&nbsp;</A></B> My flesh and my heart fail, / <I>But</I> God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:27">73:27&nbsp;</A></B> For behold, those who are far from You will perish; / You destroy all who go about as harlots away from You.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="73:28">73:28&nbsp;</A></B> But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me; / I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, / That I may declare all Your works.<BR>
