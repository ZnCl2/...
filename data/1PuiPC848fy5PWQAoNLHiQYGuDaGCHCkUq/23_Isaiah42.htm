</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:10">42:10&nbsp;</A></B> Sing a new song to Jehovah; / <I>Sing</I> His praise from the end of the earth; / You who go down to the sea and <I>all</I> that fills it, / You coastlands and their inhabitants.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:11">42:11&nbsp;</A></B> Let the wilderness and its cities, / The villages which Kedar inhabits, lift up <I>their voices;</I> / Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy; / Let them shout from the tops of the mountains.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:13">42:13&nbsp;</A></B> Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man, / Like a man of war He will stir up <I>His</I> jealousy; / He will raise a war cry; He will even roar. / He will prevail over His enemies.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:14">42:14&nbsp;</A></B> For a long time I have been silent; / I have kept still, I have restrained Myself. / <I>Now</I> I will cry like a woman in travail; / I will gasp and pant at the same time.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:15">42:15&nbsp;</A></B> I will lay waste the mountains and hills, / And all of their vegetation I will dry up; / And I will make the rivers into islands; / I will dry up the pools.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:16">42:16&nbsp;</A></B> I will bring the blind on a way they do not know; / I will guide them in paths they do not know; / I will make the darkness into light before them, / And crooked things straight. / These are the things / I will do for them and will not forsake them.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:17">42:17&nbsp;</A></B> They who have turned back will be utterly put to shame, / <I>That is,</I> those who trust in graven images, / Those who say to molten images, / You are our gods.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:18">42:18&nbsp;</A></B> You who are deaf, Hear; / And you who are blind, Look, that you may see.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:19">42:19&nbsp;</A></B> Who is blind except My servant, / And as deaf as My messenger, <I>whom</I> I will send? / Who is as blind as the one at peace <I>with Me,</I> / And as blind as the servant of Jehovah?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:20">42:20&nbsp;</A></B> You have seen many things and do not observe <I>them;</I> / <I>His</I> ears are open, but he does not hear.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:22">42:22&nbsp;</A></B> But this is a people plundered and spoiled: / All of them are trapped in holes, / And they are hidden in prison houses; / They have become plunder, and there is no one to deliver; / <I>They have become</I> spoil, and there is no one to say, Restore <I>them.</I><BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:23">42:23&nbsp;</A></B> Who among you will give ear to this? / <I>Who will</I> pay attention and listen to the coming things?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:24">42:24&nbsp;</A></B> Who gave Jacob to the plunderers, / And Israel to the robbers? / Was it not Jehovah, against whom we have sinned, / And in whose ways they were not willing to walk, / And whose law they would not obey?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="42:25">42:25&nbsp;</A></B> Therefore He poured out upon them the heat of His anger / And the strength of battle; / And set them on fire round about, yet they did not realize <I>it;</I> / And He burned against them and they did not take <I>it</I> to heart.<BR>
