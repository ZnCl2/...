</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:2">&nbsp;2:2 &nbsp;</A></B> As a lily among thorns, / So is my love among the daughters.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:3">&nbsp;2:3 &nbsp;</A></B> As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons:<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="2:9">&nbsp;2:9 &nbsp;</A></B> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. / Now he stands behind our wall; / He is looking through the windows, / He is glancing through the lattice.<BR>
