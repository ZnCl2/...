</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:1">45:1 &nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah to His anointed, / To Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, / To subdue the nations before him; / And I will loosen the loins of kings; / To open before him double doors / So that the gates will not be shut:<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:2">45:2 &nbsp;</A></B> I will go before you / And make level the rough places; / I will shatter the doors of bronze / And cut through the bars of iron,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:3">45:3 &nbsp;</A></B> And give to you the treasures of darkness / And the hidden riches of secret places, / That you may know that I am Jehovah, who calls <I>you</I> by your name, / The God of Israel.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:4">45:4 &nbsp;</A></B> For the sake of My servant, Jacob, / And Israel, My chosen one, / I have also called you by your name; / I have surnamed you, although you do not know Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:5">45:5 &nbsp;</A></B> I am Jehovah and there is no one else; / Besides Me there is no God; / I girded you, although you do not know Me;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:6">45:6 &nbsp;</A></B> That they might know from the rising of the sun and from the west / That there is no one besides Me. / I am Jehovah and there is no one else;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:7">45:7 &nbsp;</A></B> He who forms the light and creates darkness, / He who makes peace and creates evil, / I am Jehovah who makes all these things.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:8">45:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Drip down, O heavens, from above, / And let the clouds flow down righteousness; / Let the earth open / And bring forth salvation and righteousness; / Let them spring forth together; / I, Jehovah, have created it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:9">45:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Woe to him who strives with the One who formed him&nbsp;— / The potsherds among the earthen potsherds. / Shall the clay say to the One who forms it, What are You making? / And your work <I>say,</I> He has no hands?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:10">45:10&nbsp;</A></B> Woe to him who says to <I>his</I> father, What are you begetting? / Or to a woman, What are you bringing forth?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:11">45:11&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him, / Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:12">45:12&nbsp;</A></B> I have made the earth, / And created man upon it; / My own hands stretched out the heavens, / And I commanded all of their host.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:13">45:13&nbsp;</A></B> I raised him up in righteousness, / And will make straight all his ways; / He will build My city, / And send away My captives, / Neither for a price nor for a reward, / Says Jehovah of hosts.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:14">45:14&nbsp;</A></B> Thus says Jehovah, / The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Cush, / And the Sabeans, men of stature, / Will pass to you and will be yours. / They will walk behind you; they will come over in chains / And bow down to you <I>and</I> petition you, <I>saying,</I> / Surely God is with you, and there is no one else; / <I>There is</I> no other God.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:15">45:15&nbsp;</A></B> Surely You are a God who hides Himself, / O God of Israel, the Savior.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:16">45:16&nbsp;</A></B> All of them will be ashamed and even confounded; / Those who make idols go in confusion together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:17">45:17&nbsp;</A></B> Israel has been saved by Jehovah / With an eternal salvation; / You will not be ashamed or confounded / Forever and ever.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:18">45:18&nbsp;</A></B> For thus says Jehovah, / Who created the heavens&nbsp;— / He is the God / Who formed the earth and made it; / He established it; / He did not create it waste, / <I>But</I> He formed it to be inhabited: / I am Jehovah and there is no one else;<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:19">45:19&nbsp;</A></B> I have not spoken in secret, / In a dark place of the earth; / I did not say to the seed of Jacob, / Seek Me in vain. / I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, / Declaring things that are right.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:20">45:20&nbsp;</A></B> Gather yourselves together and come; / Draw near together, / You who have escaped from the nations. / Those who set up their wooden idol / And pray unto a god who cannot save / Have no knowledge.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:21">45:21&nbsp;</A></B> Declare and present <I>your case;</I> / Indeed, let them take counsel together. / Who related this long ago; / Who declared <I>it</I> from that time? / Was it not I, Jehovah? / And there is no other God besides Me; / A righteous God and Savior, / And there is no one except Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:22">45:22&nbsp;</A></B> Turn to Me and be saved, / All the ends of the earth, / For I am God and there is no one else.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:23">45:23&nbsp;</A></B> I have sworn by Myself; / A word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness / And will not return, / That every knee shall bow to Me, / And every tongue shall swear.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:24">45:24&nbsp;</A></B> It shall be said of Me, Only in Jehovah / Is there righteousness and strength. / To Him shall <I>men</I> come, / And all those who are burning in anger against Him shall be ashamed.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="45:25">45:25&nbsp;</A></B> In Jehovah all the seed of Israel / Shall be justified and shall glory.<BR>
