</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:11">&nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</A></B> In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day all the springs of the great deep burst open, and the windows of heaven were opened.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:13">&nbsp;7:13 &nbsp;</A></B> On that very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:14">&nbsp;7:14 &nbsp;</A></B> They and every animal according to its kind and all the cattle according to their kind and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth according to its kind and every bird according to its kind&nbsp;— every bird, every winged creature.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:15">&nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</A></B> And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two of all flesh in which was the breath of life.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="7:16">&nbsp;7:16 &nbsp;</A></B> And those who went in, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and Jehovah shut <I>the door</I> behind him.<BR>
