</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:4">18:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Appoint three men for each tribe, and I will send them out. And they shall rise up and go through the land, and write a description of it with a view to <I>its being</I> their inheritance; and they shall come to me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="18:5">18:5 &nbsp;</A></B> And they shall divide it into seven portions: Judah shall stay at his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay at their border on the north.<BR>
