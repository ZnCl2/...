</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:1">40:1 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah answered Job and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:2">40:2 &nbsp;</A></B> Shall one who finds fault contend with the Almighty? / Let him who argues with God answer it.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:3">40:3 &nbsp;</A></B> Then Job answered Jehovah and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:4">40:4 &nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, I am worthless. What shall I reply to You? / I lay my hand over my mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:5">40:5 &nbsp;</A></B> I have spoken once, and I will not answer; / And twice, and I will proceed no further.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:6">40:6 &nbsp;</A></B> And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:7">40:7 &nbsp;</A></B> Gird up now your loins like a mighty man; / For I will ask of you, and you shall inform Me.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:8">40:8 &nbsp;</A></B> Will you indeed annul My judgment? / Will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:9">40:9 &nbsp;</A></B> Or do you have an arm like God’s, / And can you thunder with a voice like His?<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:10">40:10&nbsp;</A></B> Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency, / And array yourself with honor and splendor.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:11">40:11&nbsp;</A></B> Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, / And look upon everyone who is proud, and abase him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:12">40:12&nbsp;</A></B> Look upon everyone who is proud; bring him down; / And tread down the wicked where they stand.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:13">40:13&nbsp;</A></B> Hide them in the dust together; / Bind their faces in the hidden place.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:14">40:14&nbsp;</A></B> Then even I will praise you, / That your own right hand can save you.<BR>

</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:15">40:15&nbsp;</A></B> Behold now the behemoth, which I made as well as you: / He eats grass like the ox.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:16">40:16&nbsp;</A></B> Behold now, his strength is in his loins, / And his power is in the muscles of his belly.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:17">40:17&nbsp;</A></B> He bends his tail like a cedar; / The sinews of his thighs knit together.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:18">40:18&nbsp;</A></B> His bones are like bronze tubes; / His limbs, like iron bars.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:19">40:19&nbsp;</A></B> He is the first of God’s ways; / <I>Only</I> his Maker can approach <I>him</I> with His sword.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:20">40:20&nbsp;</A></B> For the mountains yield food for him, / Where every animal of the field plays.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:21">40:21&nbsp;</A></B> Under the lotus plants he lies down, / In the covert of the reed and the marsh.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:22">40:22&nbsp;</A></B> The lotus plants cover him with their shade; / The willows of the brook surround him.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:23">40:23&nbsp;</A></B> Indeed, if a river overflows, he does not tremble; / He is confident, though the Jordan rushes against his mouth.<BR>
</P><B><P class="verse"><A NAME="40:24">40:24&nbsp;</A></B> Will anyone catch him while he is watching, / Or pierce <I>his</I> nose with a snare?<BR>
