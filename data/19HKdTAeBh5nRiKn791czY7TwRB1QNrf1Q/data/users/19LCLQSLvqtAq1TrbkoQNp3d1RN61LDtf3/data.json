			"body": "I created this site because using thumbnails Is also a way to host illegal files also without downloading them (think about cp pics...also hosting thumbnails you re committing a crime) in my way you dont have any problem (if you accidentally download cp you can ban It and forget about It) because you Arent forced to host illegal thumbs if you dont deny thumbs specifically. In my opinion zeronet in future Will not be a pure darknet...but must become the future web, a alternative to social network that are censoring arbitrary users. To reach this objective we should stay legal...but allowing anyone to choose without imposed censorship! No filter Bubbles... responsability only yours! ðŸ˜Š",
