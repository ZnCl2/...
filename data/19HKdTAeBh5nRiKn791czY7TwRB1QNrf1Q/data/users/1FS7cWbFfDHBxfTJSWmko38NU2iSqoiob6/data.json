			"body": "Dr. Sam Bailey on PCR test and controversy around it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9GccuvNs9U\n\nSome points from the video:\n\n* The PCR technique cannot be used as a diagnostic test, it simply duplicates genetic fragments in the sample. So if your immune system encountered the COVID19 virus and tore it into pieces, the test will still be positive. It is like, if you find a hair of a horse, to claim that there is a horse in the room.\n\n* Of if you duplicate things 35 times, you accumulate errors and the result can be just noise.\n\n* The inventor of the PCR sounded the same opinion https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/05/pcr-inventor-it-doesnt-tell-you-that-you-are-sick/\n\n* The RT-PCR test was never properly confirmed to work in the medical sense. When authorities quote its \"accuracy\" they mean \"analytical accuracy\", i.e. its chemical accuracy, how well it picks up the correct RNA fragment.\n\n* In fact, it seems the virus itself was never properly isolated and there is a 200k EUR prize for a proof to the opposite https://www.samueleckert.net/isolat-truth-fund/\n\n* Finally, the quickly-published paper that introduced the RT-PCR test for COVID19 \"Corman, Drosten, et al\" is problematic in many ways, which are examined in a report demanding retraction: https://cormandrostenreview.com/retraction-request-letter-to-eurosurveillance-editorial-board/\n\nThe description in her video:\n\nLet's dig deeper into PCR tests once again and have a look behind the curtain of this Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n#covid19pcr​\n\nNew 3rd Edition of our book Virus Mania available now!: \nBook Depository - https://www.bookdepository.com/Virus-Mania-Torsten-Engelbrecht/9783752629781?ref=grid-view&qid=1612859431116&sr=1-1​\nAmazon - https://www.amazon.com/Virus-Mania-COVID-19-Hepatitis-Billion-Dollar/dp/3752629789/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=virus+mania&qid=1612859505&sr=8-2\nE-book...is coming!\n\nReferences:\n1.

			"body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6CJO2WSiYw\n\nThe last unexpectedly large CPI numbers caused a strange effect in the markets: the gold price dropped and dollar rose up. Why is that?\n\nBecause all people who expected low inflation numbers now expect Fed to effectively defeat the inflation by rising interest rates. They just keep believing Fed and the mainstream buzz.\n\nOn top of that, the economy underperforms and most likely Fed will try to \"fix/stimulate\" it by creating more inflation. If so, more inflation will only make the economy weaker, and Fed will have even less chances to stop it.",
