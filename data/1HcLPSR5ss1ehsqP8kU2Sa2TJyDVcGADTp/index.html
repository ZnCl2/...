			<p>
				On September 27th, 2018 suspected exploitation of a series of
				vulnerabilities was found on a public ZeroNet proxy. The timing
				couldn't have been worse as nofish, ZeroNet's main developer,
				was currently on vacation. Affectionately named "The Vacation
				Vulnerability", a group of ZeroNet website developers set out to
				understand what happened and develop a patch for ZeroNet that
				could prevent the same happening to other users. A few days
				later, once the patch was near completion, nofish returned and
				began collaborating with the developers on a solution and a
				disclosure. After some tweaking, the patch was released, but
				full details were held back until a majority of clients
				had updated to protect themselves.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that many people have updated, the vulnerability details are
				released below in full. Credit goes to GitCenter for
				vulnerability discovery and the website you're currently
				reading.

				HTML/HTM extension is checked in lower case, so using filename
				like <code>index.HTM</code> would result in escaping iframe.
			</summary>

			<p>
				There are a few places where <code>.htm</code> or
				<code>.html</code> extension is checked &mdash; however, they
				are checked either with <code>str.endswith()</code> or
				<code>str.split(".")[-1] == ...</code>. For example:
			</p>
			<pre data-filename="src/Ui/UiRequest.py">
# Render a file from media with iframe site wrapper
def actionWrapper(self, path, extra_headers=None):
    if not extra_headers:
        extra_headers = {}

    match = re.match("/(?P&lt;address&gt;[A-Za-z0-9\._-]+)(?P&lt;inner_path&gt;/.*|$)", path)
    if match:
        address = match.group("address")
        inner_path = match.group("inner_path").lstrip("/")
        if "." in inner_path and not inner_path.endswith(".html") and not inner_path.endswith(".htm"):
            return self.actionSiteMedia("/media" + path)  # Only serve html files with frame
</pre>
			<p>
				This leads to a way to disable wrapper without using
				<i>NOSANDBOX</i> permission, which would, of course, shock the
				user &mdash; it's description is:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Modify your client's configuration and access all site
				<i>(sic)</i>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				By the way, looks like there is no way to use
				<code>index.htm</code> or <code>main.html</code> or any other
				page instead of <code>index.html</code>. I'm quote sure that
				the lack of this Apache's feature will make it harder to switch
				sites to use ZeroNet.
			</p>

			<summary>
				Wrapper can be embed to <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.
			</summary>

			<p>
				Let's try to add the following code to <code>index.html</code>:
			</p>
			<pre data-filename="index.html">
&lt;iframe src="/"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>
			<p>
				This code opens wrapper (which renders ZeroHello) in iframe.
				However, it doesn't work. If you open Chrome console, you'll
				notice this:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Refused to display
				'http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D' in a
				frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Oops. Moreover, if we try to use
				<code>iframe.contentWindow</code>, it simply won't work: because
				of <code>sandbox</code> attribute on the iframe containing our
				<code>index.html</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there is a solution. We have <b>#1</b>, so
				<code>sandbox</code> is not a problem now. Using
				code from <code>index.html</code> is not a good idea, because
				we'll be immediately redirected to ZeroHello, however, we can
				add <code>sandbox</code> attribute ourselves:
			</p>
			<pre data-filename="index.HTM">
&lt;iframe src="/" sandbox="allow-same-origin"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>
			<p>
				Easy-peasy. Add some styles like <code>opacity: 0</code> and
				it's ready. Moreover, no scripts will be executed, so
				<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that contains
				<code>wrapper_key</code> won't be removed.
			</p>

				Language can contain <code>..</code>, which results in reading
				JSON file outside current site or <code>plugins/</code>
				directory.
			</summary>

			<p>
				This vurnerability was not used in The Vacation attack, and I
				can hardly imagine how it can be used, but it's a
				vurner<i>ability</i> &mdash; so I report it as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				ZeroFrame API has a command called <code>configSet</code>. You
				pass it <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> and, if the key
				is <code>tor</code>, <code>language</code>,
				<code>tor_use_bridges</code> or <code>trackers_proxy</code>, it
				saves it to <code>zeronet.conf</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, here comes the idea. We can call <code>configSet</code>
				(it's admin command, but we have admin right because we are
				directly connected to WebSocket) with <code>language</code> key
				and pass it some path. ZeroNet would join
				<code>languages/</code>, your string and <code>.json</code>.
				It may look like if you pass <code>../../users</code>, it would
				point to <code>users.json</code>. You're right, but looks like
				there is no way to read that file somehow. When site data is
				translated, language name is checked against <code>..</code>.
				When plugin text is translated (e.g.: <i>Connected</i> and
				<i>Delete</i> in sidebar), file path is not checked, however, we
				can't change sidebar text &mdash; so it doesn't help at all.
			</p>

				Language can contain <code>"</code> and <code>&lt;</code>.
			</summary>

			<p>
				This vurnerability was not used in The Vacation as well,
				however, it may simplify stealing mail or something like that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most sites made by @nofish (e.g.: ZeroHello, ZeroMail, ZeroMe,
				etc.) use <code>&lt;script src="...?lang={lang}"&gt;</code> to
				include JS files. It's a pity no one else uses it, because it's
				a useful feature. Originally, to avoid caching the wrong
				language. Pretend you choose English language in ZeroHello, and
				then switch to Chinese. English version would be cached, and
				you'd have to wait for cache to expire to download the new,
				Chinese version.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using ADMIN permission we had from <b>#2</b> and using
				<code>configSet</code> like we used it in <b>#3</b>, we can
				change <code>language</code> to
				<code>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;YOURCODE&lt;script data-a="</code> and
				embed our HTML code (or JS code, if we add <code>script</code>
				tag) to other sites.
			</p>

			<summary>
				ZeroUpdate code is not signed.
			</summary>

			<p>
				It's time to remember that ADMIN permission gives us access to
				all sites. What about such site as... ZeroUpdate?
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				New way to receive updates (currently optional): Simply visit
				site
				<a href="/1UPDatEDxnvHDo7TXvq6AEBARfNkyfxsp">
					1UPDatEDxnvHDo7TXvq6AEBARfNkyfxsp
				</a>
				to receive updates via the ZeroNet network. Next time when you
				push the update button of your client, then it will use this
				site to update your client to the latest version. This way you
				don't have to trust SSL Certificate providers/source-code
				hosting companies, because everything is cryptographically
				signed. It's also delivers the updates to countries where github
				is not accessible.
				<a href="/Blog.ZeroNetwork.bit/?Post:98">ZeroBlog</a>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				"Cryptographically signed". Yeah. But what exactly is signed?
				File transactions between peers. Not files themselves. So if
				someone gives you a file with wrong content, you'll notice it --
				the signature doesn't match the one inside
				<code>content.json</code>, which is cryptographically signed.
				But you'll never notice that a signature doesn't match if you
				change the file yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				This leads to a way to run Python code on your machine. Simply
				change some file in <code>ZeroNet</code> folder of ZeroUpdate,
				and ask the user to update. Or even don't ask: call
				<code>serverUpdate</code> yourself. The user won't even notice
				the error message:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Connection with UiServer Websocket was lost. Reconnecting...
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				...because it is drawn by the wrapper &mdash; and we've disabled
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				So what can we do? We can change some rarely used file, e.g.
				from a library, such as <code>PySocks</code> &mdash; or even an
				executable, like <code>tor.exe</code>. Our script (or
				executable) would steal private keys for your sites from
				<code>users.json</code>. It would steal private keys for your
				<i>ZeroID</i>, <i>KaffieID</i> and <i>PeakID</i> accounts. It
				would steal encryption keys for your <i>ZeroMail</i>.
