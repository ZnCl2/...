If I were, I'd definitely do it.\nIf this is still relevant, I have recently gotten to the conclusion that (at least for ADSL/VDSL consumers) it is very cost effective to buy a NETGEAR DM200 and flash on it LEDE (am still testing this, there is no officialy stable version yet, and I had accidentally bricked it by turning it off while it was updating the settings (this is after I had installed the GUI, and from it)), as well as order a Xiaomi Mi 3 router, and flash on it Padavan (My Mi3 router has been comfortably rocking Padavan for over half a year already).\n\nAltogether, the price should amount to ~75$, including shipping (A rough estimate, I don't live in the US), and the duo should be able to continue serving for over double the time that most stock configurations do, while matching, if not surpassing the worth of ~150$ stock configurations.\n\nIf anyone wants links, I'll be glad to post them, however I am rather busy at work, so I don't have much time to look for them.",
