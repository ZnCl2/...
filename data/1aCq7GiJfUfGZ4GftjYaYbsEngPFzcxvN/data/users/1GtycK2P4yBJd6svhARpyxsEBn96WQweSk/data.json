I don't know what I did wrong but I noticed other people have made the same mistake. There needs to be a video tutorial posted on Kopy Kate to show people the correct way to upload videos and get them to play.\n\nThink of it like the YouTube equivalent of The Pirate Bay.\n\nOne cannot upload videos to The Pirate Bay because it's only a database for finding magnet links. If the magnet links aren't being seeded, you won't be able to download anything.\n\nLikewise, this is a browser-based Torrent engine that can stream videos. You need to have the torrent seeding on your WebTorrent.Desktop client, and it needs to be running 24/7. If you can't have the PC running 24/7 the other option would be to use a webseed. (Tutorials coming soon!)",
