She has an amazing voice but hasn't gotten much recognition. Please check out more of her other covers, she will not leave you disappointed! She is a Korean utaite and has an amazing range. (:\n\nMyulee: \"It was an honor to join this collaboration(っ´ω`c)\nI hope you enjoy the song♪♬♫\"\n\nFor the Anime (Re:Zero), I love how much of a change of mood this opening really brings to the Anime. MYTH&ROID have been on a roll lately and they are really showing us how flexible and epic they can be!\n\nFor the remix, I decided to go with a Glitch Hop Trap mix (Trap Hop haha) and I really had a ton of fun coming up with drop ideas. I tried to go out of my box and make a different kind of drop for you guys. I hope you'll like it xD I usually don't really like these kind of drops myself but after experiencing a lot of EDM shows, I have a new respect for the kind of drop that builds up so much and just drops the bass with a simpler melody line instead of an explosion of sound that I've grown to love.\n\nAll in all, it's been a bit since my last upload because I've been preparing for some shows (Anime Festival Orlando, and San Japan). My AFO show was beyond fun and I had the time of my life meeting new people and hang out with some old friends! I can't wait to go to Texas for the first time at San Japan! See you guys then!\n\nFor now, I leave you with this extended remix from one of the best shows this year!\n\nSee you next time!\n\n___\n\nDownload: https://soundcloud.com/dj-jomusicchannel/paradisus-paradoxum-feat-myulee-dj-jo-remix-extended-version\n\nOff vocal / Instrumental downloads\nTV Size: https://instaud.io/uEA\nExtended: https://instaud.io/uEC\n\nFor my social media (Twitter, Facebook, Soundcloud, etc.) Visit my website!\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.dj-jo.com/\n\nBandcamp: http://dj-jo.bandcamp.com/\niTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/dj-jo/id456075071",
