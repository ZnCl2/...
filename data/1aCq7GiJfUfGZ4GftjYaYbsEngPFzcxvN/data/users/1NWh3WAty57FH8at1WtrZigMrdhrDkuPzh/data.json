I'm not exactly in the best financial situation. If I were, I'd definitely do it. IPFS also seems like it could be a good solution. Can you webseed from it? That might actually work. I'm well familiar with it, but the problem I always have is that content doesn't stay online like ZeroNet. As soon as my machine goes off, it's a dead link. Which is no better than just running a regular HTTP server on my computer. On top of that, it requires the viewer to have IPFS. If we can fix those two problems (all viewers download/cache the video to help share/seed it, and all viewers have IPFS) then this could very well be the way to go. There *have* been IPFS video sharing tests before. But from what I've seen, Webtorrent works the best. The only problem with webtorrent is the lack of seeders, hence the need for a webseed.\n\nI'm starting to feel like this type of project *can't* be done with only an in-browser solution, and would need a client that downloads and seeds the videos as you watch them, ensuring up-time. Perhaps I should move my focus off of ZeroNet and onto a dedicated client?",

There's apparently a 200mb limit .. the owner merely did it as an experiment to show what can be accomplished with Webtorrent, not for it to become a filesharing cloud .. lol\n> I did ask him at one point if he had the source code for Peerify.. but he said to me that it will remain closed source.\n> It shouldn't be hard to accomplish in principle though. All you need is a script that uploads files to your VPS and then creates a .torrent file that automatically adds the uploaded .mp4 as a webseed. Cross-origin resource sharing would have to be enabled.\n> I'm running a VPS myself for my webseeds, but I only have a 200gb limit right now. It's not a permanent solution to lack of seeds - we'll just have to hope that more people take interest in the project for it to become an uncensored YouTube alternative.\n\nThanks for the heads up. I'm still trying to find a good solution for people to jump on and have low investment. I've been trying to figure out how to mirror Bitchute videos, but it seems without CORS enabled there's not much we can do. There doesn't seem to be a clean solution, unfortunately. Perhaps we could make *ZeroNet* our webseed? Would that be possible? Upload the video as an optional file, and then generate the torrent for it and have users help spread the webseed if they need it, and otherwise download from peers.\n\nAs I mentioned, I unfortunately don't have a dedicated server of any kind that I can play around with, and if possible I'd like to work on a free solution to get as many people involved as possible. I'm curious what you mean by 'a 200mb limit'. You mean I'd just be blocked from uploading more? Or that the older files would be deleted? Either way, relying on it is probably a bad idea. But it's useful for people who want to upload a video or two.",

He would probably not be very happy about it .. and e-mail me or something.\n\nYeah, I guess that makes sense haha. I sent a message over to the bitchute guys to see if they'll add CORS support to their webseeds. They have restricted uploads at the moment, but I explained how being able to share the content would be good as a whole. Perhaps we can get more cross-over content that way.\n\n> Obviously, the only way to get KopyKate popular is to share the link and spread the word (WWW.KopyKate.GA). And thus, the more people are viewing, the more seeding gets done .. so it's a matter of getting a constant stream of viewers in order to sustain the torrents on the internet, without even having to seed them from the Desktop client.\n\nThe problem is that this will always remain an issue for new videos. I doubt that every single video always has two people watching it. Really what needs to happen is a sort of federated data storage for these video sharing platforms. Something like what usenet does.\n\n> Using ZeroNet to store the videos may work in principle, but in practice that means that the site would take ages to load, because everyone who wants to seed the site would have to download each individual video stores on the entire site .. and at one point it would probably take years to load it. ;)\n\nWell it'd be optional files. The only people who'd have to download them would be the people trying to watch the video. Alternatively I saw ZeroMux doing a lot of work with video streaming. Perhaps something like that could be tied in?",

There's a lot of work to do, having said that .. but it will be worth it when it's ready!\n\nYeah. Obviously the list needs to be decentralized. Something like ZeroNet works well for that. Though one big issue that we just ran into for the first time here on ZN. Such a torrent/magnet list site went down randomly. @Sirenyc's ZeroTV is now just a blank index page. Some users (including myself) have managed to backup the data, but it's clear that sites are still prone to going down. I think what'd be best is something like ZeroMe, with the various decentralized hubs backend, and the customizable viewer frontend. That way if one hub goes down, the rest of the content is safe. Likewise, if a viewer goes down, the content is still safe.\n\nI was messing around with that a bit, but it looks like I should start working on it more. Cross-listing torrents is very important.",

That means that if you open that port, you'll be able to access your torrent client from another computer, and permanently upload and seed files to it.. by simply typing: http://<my.ip.address>:1337/ . It would also have to come with some optional password protection, unless you're running a proper server that you intend to be publicly accessible.\n> Unlike Kittify, it will be purely torrent-based. Only the web-interface GUI will be based on a node.js HTTP webserver.\n> I'm pretty sure Instant.io and Btorrent.xyz already use a similar technology, but the owners seem to have lost interest in these projects.. and the code is just all over the place. I want to strip it down to the very basic essentials, and also provide tons of documentation so that we can get more people involved in the project.\n\nSounds great. Hopefully people will be able to set up a few of these, and auto-fetch every new kopykate video, and help seed them. Making it easy to set up and help seed content will reduce reliance on a single central server (kittify). Having a desktop client that doesn't just completely die would be nice too :)",
