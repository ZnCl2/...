It's the easiest way to get a video up 24/7 without having to seed yourself. As for why there aren't more, it's because no one else seeds the videos. It's an ongoing problem with webtorrent, namely due to performance issues with webrtc.\n\nI doubt it has anything to do with the performance of WebRTC and WebTorrent. It's just that not a lot of people are aware that this software exists.. including ZeroNet. Publicity is what we need more than anything .. the code will write itself. ;)",
