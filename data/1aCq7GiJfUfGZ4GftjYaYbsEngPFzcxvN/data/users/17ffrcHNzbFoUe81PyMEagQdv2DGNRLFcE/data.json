Hopefully this works for you guys. I'm going through Peerify by Btorrent. Seems to work great. I also moved the other videos over as well. I've noticed it gives higher speeds than dropbox did too, so that's a plus. Though I'm wondering if they might remove the videos after some time, I really don't know. So I'll keep an eye out and see how it goes.\n\nI'd just be careful about uploading too many videos to Peerify. There's apparently a 200mb limit .. the owner merely did it as an experiment to show what can be accomplished with Webtorrent, not for it to become a filesharing cloud .. lol\n\nI did ask him at one point if he had the source code for Peerify.. but he said to me that it will remain closed source.\n\nIt shouldn't be hard to accomplish in principle though. All you need is a script that uploads files to your VPS and then creates a .torrent file that automatically adds the uploaded .mp4 as a webseed. Cross-origin resource sharing would have to be enabled.\n\nI'm running a VPS myself for my webseeds, but I only have a 200gb limit right now. It's not a permanent solution to lack of seeds - we'll just have to hope that more people take interest in the project for it to become an uncensored YouTube alternative.",

I've been trying to figure out how to mirror Bitchute videos, but it seems without CORS enabled there's not much we can do. There doesn't seem to be a clean solution, unfortunately. Perhaps we could make ZeroNet our webseed? Would that be possible? Upload the video as an optional file, and then generate the torrent for it and have users help spread the webseed if they need it, and otherwise download from peers.\n> As I mentioned, I unfortunately don't have a dedicated server of any kind that I can play around with, and if possible I'd like to work on a free solution to get as many people involved as possible. I'm curious what you mean by 'a 200mb limit'. You mean I'd just be blocked from uploading more? Or that the older files would be deleted? Either way, relying on it is probably a bad idea. But it's useful for people who want to upload a video or two.\n\nI think my main concern is what Diego would think about people using it to upload on KopyKate, not so much the data limit .. haha. He would probably not be very happy about it .. and e-mail me or something.\n\nObviously, the only way to get KopyKate popular is to share the link and spread the word (WWW.KopyKate.GA). And thus, the more people are viewing, the more seeding gets done .. so it's a matter of getting a constant stream of viewers in order to sustain the torrents on the internet, without even having to seed them from the Desktop client.\n\nYou can actually Upload videos using a zeronet Proxy, so downloading the Zeronet client to participate is no longer necessary. It's only a matter of remembering the key to your Masterseed that is automatically generated each time you visit the site (store it on a USB drive), creating a ZeroID .. and then using it as normal.  I guess I'd have to create lots of video tutorials on that  , too ..... I guess I'll stop procrastinating and do it this weekend.\n\nUsing ZeroNet to store the videos may work in principle, but in practice that means that the site would take ages to load, because everyone who wants to seed the site would have to download each individual video stores on the entire site .. and at one point it would probably take years to load it. ;)",

I sent a message over to the bitchute guys to see if they'll add CORS support to their webseeds. They have restricted uploads at the moment, but I explained how being able to share the content would be good as a whole. Perhaps we can get more cross-over content that way.\n> \n> The problem is that this will always remain an issue for new videos. I doubt that every single video always has two people watching it. Really what needs to happen is a sort of federated data storage for these video sharing platforms. Something like what usenet does.\n> \n> Well it'd be optional files. The only people who'd have to download them would be the people trying to watch the video. Alternatively I saw ZeroMux doing a lot of work with video streaming. Perhaps something like that could be tied in?\n\nIdeally, the best course of action would be to have a sort of hybrid system in which everything works together in harmony, so I suppose you are right. Kinda like we have right now, but more user-friendly.. lol\n\nThus, a site that would temporarily web-seed new videos until they get enough seeders would be ideal!",

Things like WebTorrent, Dropbox and Instant.io need integrated into Kopy Kate or something like them needs integrated into Kopy Kate. There are just to many steps needed to get videos to play right, that's a big turn off for me. Kopy Kate needs to be more like ZeroMusic but for videos instead of mp3's, where people can just upload videos directly to Kopy Kate.\n\nZeroMusic isn't centralized, it's still decentralized.\n\nHowever, the way ZeroMusic works is you have music files stored inside the very site itself. Every one who loads the site will also have to download every single .mp3 file that is stored in it.\n\nCould you imagine if you had to download every single YouTube video in existence, before you could watch YouTube? In the early days of the site, it may have taken a few hours .. but over the years, people have uploaded zillions of gigabites worth of video. It would probably take a lifetime to download all that content with an average internet speed, unless you introduce centralization.. but centralization means weakness, the risk of getting DMCA raids, etc.\n\nI think the same thing will eventually happen to any ZeroNet site that uses this method. However, the only reason it works well at the moment is because ZeroNet is not popular enough and not enough data has been uploaded to these sites.\n\nThis site only stores magnet links, and magnet links only take up a few bytes of data .. and even so it will eventually have to split up its load if it becomes big enough. If someone wants to watch a video, they only stream the video they want to watch by pointing their torrent clients at a magnet address.",

				"body": "> [kaffie](#comment_30_1NWh3WAty57FH8at1WtrZigMrdhrDkuPzh): Seems to work fine. Instant.io works better, gives 2 peers and I get up to 3MB/s. KopyKate leads to a slower dl at ~1MB/s and less, and then cuts out after a few seconds for some reason. No idea why that is though. Entirely watchable on instant.io and webtorrent desktop. And as usual, once I start seeding with webtorrent desktop, the kopykate vid works fine. Hmm. Either way, good upload IMO.\n\nMaybe instant.io has a more updated Webtorrent.js version .. I'll have to check and see. Most likely to be the case..\n\nAnywhoo .. great upload!",
