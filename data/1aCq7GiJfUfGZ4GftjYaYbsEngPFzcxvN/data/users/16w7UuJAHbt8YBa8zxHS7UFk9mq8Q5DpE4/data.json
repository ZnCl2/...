WebTorrent isn't programmed in order to leak your IP, obviously.. though theoretically, somebody could modify their local Javascript in order to leak all of the IP addresses of peers that are seeding/downloading a torrent. Not 100% sure about this however, as it hasn't been tested.\n\nThis alone is no reason to dismiss WebTorrent altogether, as it is a powerful and versatile tool that will save time and bring torrenting to the mainstream. WebRTC is open source, and security is obviously a major concern to many users, so there's a lot of people working on a fix for this problem right now. I will post updates on this issue in the News thread, so stay tuned!",

For what it's worth, WebTorrent posts this info on their FAQ:\n> \"Does WebTorrent leak your IP address when using a VPN? I heard that WebRTC leaks your IP address.\n> No.\n> WebRTC data channels do not allow a website to discover your public IP address when there is a VPN in use. The WebRTC discovery process will just find your VPN's IP address and the local network IP address.\n> Local IP addresses (e.g. 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x) can potentially be used to \"fingerprint\" your browser and identify across different sites that you visit, like a third-party tracking cookie. However, this is a separate issue than exposing your real public IP address, and it's worth noting that the browser already provides hundreds of vectors for fingerprinting you (e.g. your installed fonts, screen resolution, browser window size, OS version, language, etc.).\n> If you have a VPN enabled, then WebRTC data channels will not connect to peers using your true public IP address, nor will it be reveled to the JavaScript running on the webpage.\n> At one point in time, WebRTC did have an issue where it would allow a website to discover your true public IP address, but this was fixed a long time ago. This unfortunate misinformation keeps bouncing around the internet.\n> There's now a spec that defines exactly which IP addresses are exposed with WebRTC. If you're interested in further reading, you can read the IP handling spec for yourself.\"\n\nThanks for that info, btw. Who would have known that the answer was in the Webtorrent faq? Geez.. just shoot me now. lol",

There is also some tutorials available on the stickied topics. After you've installed it, you simply click on the magnet icon on this page under the video player, and then it'll download the torrent. You can also add your own torrents, and then add them to KopyKate. They will play so long as they're seeding, and if codec settings are right.\n&nbsp;\nIdeally, for long term seeding, especially if you have a lot of videos, I'd recommend Web-Seeding the torrents on DropBox. There's also one tutorial on how to do that in the same thread.",

The original magnet link was taken from Play on Zeronet and downloaded to WebTorrent which works fine when played in app. But, once WebTorrent's magnet link is downloaded here on KopyKate only the first (and shortest) MP4 file plays even though it downloads the whole 1.31GB. I was trying to get the same number of peers on Play to show on KopyKate. Did not happen. But file seems to download much quicker: this may just be perception or luck. No criticism of KopyKate intended. Thank you for your good work.\n\nCriticism is very much welcome and needed.\n\nWebTorrent Desktop uses VLC media player in order to play media that is being downloaded to the computer. \n\nHowever, on the browser, you need to have your videos especially encoded for browser playback (this is why videos that have been downloaded from YouTube, will play perfectly on here). On YouTube, all of this is done automatically on your behalf on their servers .. which is why there is a delay after uploading (Processing your video ... 95%...)\n\nThat's when YouTube digests your video into a lighter format that goes easy on most devices. This format uses H.264 video and AAC audio, with an average bitrate of 1mbps or so. Most of the times when you watch a video, it also switches you into 480p mode (which is a resolution of about 720x480).\n\nWebTorrent also cannot harness peers from BitTorrent clients. They're both incompatible. WebTorrent uses WebRTC .. bittorrent uses UDP/TCP",

Problem I have right now is that I'm using a 12 year old laptop for encoding AND seeding .. and a lot of the time this thing just crashes and dies on me .. which stops all the torrents from seeding.\n\nOnce I get a good quad core desktop with 3.0ghz 8GB ram with a good NVIDIA graphics card, I could be pumping out 20 movies a day. Should get that organized by January. ;)",
