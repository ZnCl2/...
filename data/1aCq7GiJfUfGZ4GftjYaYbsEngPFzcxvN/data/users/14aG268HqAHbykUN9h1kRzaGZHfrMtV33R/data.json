The player on this site is also technically just a torrent client, except it only works on Firefox because it's loaded within an iFrame.\n> Of course, if that won't work either, then there's gotta be something in your browser settings that's blocking the requests. I'd need more info e.g. Operating system, Browser version, are you behind a firewall on a college campus, etc. in order to work on a fix, that is .. assuming that we're talking about a bug, and not just user-specific settings.\n\nThat prompted me to download the torrent. The problem was that I needed webtorrent installed, after that, vids load fine. Please clarify to users that it is required, try to find a way to make it work w/o requiring them to install sftwre as well.",
