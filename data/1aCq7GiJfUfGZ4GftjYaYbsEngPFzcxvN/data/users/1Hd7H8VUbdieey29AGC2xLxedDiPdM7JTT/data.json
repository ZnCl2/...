Hard to say what an accurate translation is, but I'd imagine this is pretty close:\n> \n> Juno, Jupiter, Minerva, Apollo, Mars, Ceres,\n> Mercury, Diana, Bacchus, Vulcan, Pluto, Vesta, Venus.\n> Floating on the edge of despair, eyes still twitching even in sleep.\n> There are gods who dwell within our fantasies, \n> Gently pass within our depths with ease.Their chains of time and space under siege,Freedom awaits if we have the key.\n> It's a fantasy program bestowed unto us by the Gods.\n> Now ein, zwei, drei,\n> Soon we will synchronize.Now ein, zwei, drei,Escaping our demise!\n> If we believe and have the courage, \n> Reaching for the miracle forever longed forIn this, survival game!\n> A spiral unto doom...\n> Juno, Jupiter, Minerva, Apollo, Mars, Ceres,\n> Mercury, Diana, Bacchus, Valcan, Pluto, Vesta, Venus.\n> Try to rewrite all of my fears,\n> Future change is what I seek.\n> The noises of reincarnation,\n> Which holds the fantasies together,Are resounding.Time is distorting, while the melodies and laws of karmaAre crumbling away.\n> It's a mechanical program bestowed unto us by the Gods.\n> So now ein, zwei, drei,\n> Reach out and take my hand!So now ein, zwei, drei,This death we shall withstand!\n> If I believe and I have courage, \n> I'll reach the end of this tragedy,Erase game!It's like a strange fantasy.\n> It's a mechanical program given to us by the Gods.\n> Now ein, zwei, drei,\n> We've got to act like one.Now ein, zwei, drei,Escaping our demise!\n> If we believe and have courage,\n> Reaching for the miracle prolonged in this,Survival game!\n> A spiral unto doom.\n> Onlookers are watching us in pity.\n> If only they knew why we have to keep fighting.I always believed there was a deeper meaning.Paradise is waiting for me,Or so I believed....\n\ncool",
