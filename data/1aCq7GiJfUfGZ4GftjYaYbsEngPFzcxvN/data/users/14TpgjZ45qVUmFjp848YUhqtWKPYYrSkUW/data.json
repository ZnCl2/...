I spilled beer all over my quadcore gaming computer.. was only two or three droplets, but it landed right inside the DC jack.. which ended up frying the whole system. Now I'm stuck with having to use my old computer.. until I can save up $1500 :(Â One thing's for sure - I'm NEVER buying a gaming laptop again. At least if you spill coffee on your keyboard, you can buy a new keyboard.. which is less than $10. Laptops should only be used for people who travel, not for carrying out CPU/graphics-intensive operations inside your bedroom.\n\nBeen there, I'm embarrassed to post how much I spent on a gaming laptop. I'll just agree with your experience.",
