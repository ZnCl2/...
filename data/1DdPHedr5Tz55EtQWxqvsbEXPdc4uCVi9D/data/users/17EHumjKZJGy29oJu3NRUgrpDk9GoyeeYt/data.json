Does anyone have any knowledge on psychologically torture beyond some basic bitch article?\n\n▶Anonymous  08/07/19 (Wed) 04:21:14 No.32>>b78c070b-7253-490c-95ca-1ad435f5670d\n\n>>6b8e9f07-b831-4e83-8449-dbea5844d9d3 (You)\n\nDid you look for cia resources yet? That seems like something they would do experiment with. Also, look into sleep deprivation, from what I understand and what someone posted some time ago, is that after a while your mind kind of gives up and you might consider doing something you might not have under normal conditions. It also works best on ideologically driven people. I dont have a screen cap though. Wish I did.\n\n▶Anonymous (You)  08/07/19 (Wed) 05:34:52 No.33\n\n>>bc57d1df-ba42-4608-b279-d012d98f5ed4\n\nI was mainly searching terms like \"psychology\" \"effects\" \"solitary confinement\" and mainly things to the same quality and level of detail as research articles on pubmed/scihub. Like most topics, the search engine results are going to be flooded with really diluted information from news sites and magazines.\n\nMainly, I didn't want, for example, 5 hours of solitary confinement to actually equate to nothing in terms of torture, and nothing to realistically get unhinged over. To entirely avoid some crazy ass fandom girl/guy going like \"I do that for BDSM all the time and that's nothing!\"\n\nIf there's somehow information on \"what form of torture works best on x personality type\" that'd be immensely useful.",
