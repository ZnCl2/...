This is nothing more than a (not so) thinly veld ad-hominem attack and does not actually address the critiques of the system of capital levied against it's upholders. I work, I work hard. Some times I get less than 10 hours of sleep a week I work so hard. It's interesting to see first hand how inane your ideology actually is.",

The thing is, ultimately, yes the right and the left have ideologically opposed economic views. The right upholds the economic mode of capitalism at the end of the day. Your idea of \"Socialism\" is really just a form of class collaborationism. I'm not new here I just suffle my ID around every so often.\n\n>>dbd93750-4d95-48ee-97b9-27ee4e8e42d1\n>>397592cc-6aef-440c-99a4-c692beab2738\nMore ad-hmoniem and no real arguments being made. At the end of the day the profitable nature of capitalism is and will drive humanity further and further towards the brink of social, cultural, and economic collapse.\n\nWether you like to admit it or not, the nature of capitalism pushes further and further the people you seek to drive together apart; and all of humanity. An informed thinking population is not profitable to them. \n\nThey want everyone to become totally isolated and atomized consumers. You are playing right into their hands. Not the jews, the capitalist class.",

And I don't dislike the pepe and wojack memes either I just find a certain appeal in the aesthetics f leftist ones. And yeah, I mean, I am not just brushing it off as an ad-hominem, but, I think the point of any conversation like this one is to put our ideological rigor to the test and that means discussions about our economic and political ideology and how they hold up to one another. Not speculations about whom one another may or may not be. This is an image-board; the whole purpose of the existence of it is to defeat that purpose. That's really what I was getting at",

Ideally, communism as is understood by us, communists, means a society in which the state, class, money, and the generalized production of commodities has been abolished and replaced with a classless, stateless, moneyless society in whcih the production of goods has been put directly into the hands of the workers.\n\nIn other words, those who run the mills should own them. The working classes should have control over their lives and their work places. Work places should not be dominated by an oligarch group of people with total control over the worlds resources. That is the ideas of communism that is most commonly shared by \\all communists and socialists.\n\nNow the struggle and how to achieve that point or better the lives of people before that point is actually the topic most debated between leftists of varying ideologies. Most people I have interacted with tend to take a bottom up, at least some what, decentralized approach too it. Such as a form of labor unions or syndicalistic types of economic modes of production to replace localities of capital accumulation.",
