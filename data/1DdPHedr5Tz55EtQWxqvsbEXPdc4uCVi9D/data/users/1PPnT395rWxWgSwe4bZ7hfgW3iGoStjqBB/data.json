If you look for it on /pol/ archives you'll see it's just spammed among other keywords to make this kind of tracking less effective, but there aren't many mentions about it on there other than that.",

I'm sure tards said the same thing it the late 90s when filesharing came up. This system will be gradually improved over the years, there is more than enough bandwidth available, the software just needs to be optimized to be able to use it.",

For example, suggesting you don't really need to use Tor if you want to stay private, or that he can't censor anything on this board when with his private key he can silently delete or override any of the board's data.\nIf he really did made significant changes to the thread, even though Millchan is under a very permissive license which allows you to do whatever, he should post a changelist or the git log along with the source code. In fact, if he doesn't he is violating the licenses of the libraries the board uses, whether they are GPL or LGPL, because they're part of the derived work the anon is distributed.\n>namely muted posters not always being actually muted.\nYou got it backwards. That bug is part of 08chan's code, and it's allegedly fixed on the current version of Millchan. I have my doubts about it working on Millchan, but I'm pretty sure muting content doesn't delete it from the user's hard drive on 08chan's software either.\n>but a seperate version of the code with more differences than just bug fixes and features. \nThat are made by a team that made the software in the first place, not the guy that just deployed it and allegedly made some changes that are so small they don't change the interface or compatibility between clients in any way.\n>I have seen a lot of people suggesting that the board owner is simply asleep at the wheel but If you actually read the sticky you can see why this is not the case.\nActually if you read the sticky you'll find he is. I mentioned two gross issues with what he said. What are you arguments for saying he does know what he's doing?",
