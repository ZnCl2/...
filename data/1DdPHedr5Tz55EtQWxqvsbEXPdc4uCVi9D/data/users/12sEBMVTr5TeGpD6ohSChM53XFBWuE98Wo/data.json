Pissing off people with switch and bait is his favorite hobby. I doubt he'd be worried about journos or anything. But yeah, chen/pol/ was really fun for a while. Nothing to be taken too seriously but a funny shitposting fest, like /pol/ getting drunk together. Now the site is dead and half of the people left even using it are just flooding the catalog of every board because they're pissed with the removal of /pol/.  Good riddance I say!\nIf it wasn't closed down I probably wouldn't have bothered with zeronet.",
