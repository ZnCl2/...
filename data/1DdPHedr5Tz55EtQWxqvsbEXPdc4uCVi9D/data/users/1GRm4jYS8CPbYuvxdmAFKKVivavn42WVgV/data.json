By airline standards, the aircraft is old - it's first flight was in 1973.\nTo put that into perspective, Air New Zealand's 747 -200s, which they first flew in 1981, were retired from the airlines fleet in 2000 at the age of 19 years. The E4B is still flying at the ripe old age of 45 years.\nThe Boeing E4 was built to be a mobile command post for the president of the United States, even in the event of nuclear war. It's designed to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion and remaine completely intact. Because of this, its become known as the 'Doomsday Plane'.\nOn top of being essentially a flying bunker for the US president, the aircraft is also part of the massive, behind-the-scenes contingency planning that goes into any presidential visit.\n...\nhttps://www.newshub.co.nz/home/travel/2019/08/five-facts-about-the-boeing-e4b-doomsday-plane.html\nhttp://archive.is/IKcFo\n\n==TOM FITTON SUES\nTom Fitton @TomFitton @JudicialWatch\nSues over California Law Requiring Presidential Candidates Appearing on Primary Ballot to Disclose Tax Returns - @RealDonaldTrump\nhttps://twitter.com/TomFitton/status/1158423368967892993\n\n==TRAGEDY AVERTED\nFeds Say They Have Thwarted a Mass Shooting Plot In Lubbock, Texas\nhttps://breaking911.com/tragedy-averted-feds-say-they-have-thwarted-a-mass-shooting-plot-in-lubbock-texas/\n\n==Keep Eyes on\nhttps://poal.co/s/QStorm/\nhttps://voat.co/v/QRV\nhttps://breaking911.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/TomFitton\nhttps://twitter.com/thehill\nhttps://twitter.com/ #qanon #wwg1wga\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\n\n==Brazilian Gang Leader dresses like woman, escape thwarted (twatt video demasking)\nCheck it out: twitter.com/i/status/1158133342052728832\n\n==The Declining Empire Of Chaos Is Going Nuts Over Iran\nAuthored by Federico Pieraccini via The Strategic Culture Foundation,\nThe transition in recent years from a unipolar to a multipolar world order has created international tensions that seem to threaten to escalate into clashes between regional and global powers.\nIn 2014 we were almost at the point of no return in Ukraine following the coup d’etat supported and funded by NATO and involving extremist right-wing Ukrainian nationalists. The conflict in the Donbass risked escalating into a conflict between NATO and the Russian Federation, every day in the summer and autumn of 2014 threatening to be doomsday. Rather than respond to the understandable impulse to send Russian troops into Ukraine to defend the population of Donbass, Putin had the presense of mind to pursue the less direct and more sensible strategy of supporting the material capacity of the residents of Donbass to resist the depredations of the Ukrainian army and their neo-Nazi Banderite thugs. Meanwhile, Europe’s inept leaders initially egged on Ukraine’s destabilization, only to get cold feet after reflecting on the possibility of having a conflict between Moscow and Washington fought on European soil.\nMoar here:\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-08-05/declining-empire-chaos-going-nuts-over-iran\n\n==22% Of Millennials Say They Have No Friends\n2% Of Millennials Say They Have No Friends\n\nA staggering 22% of millennials (aged 23 - 38) surveyed by YouGov say they have no friends, while less than 1/3 say they have at least 10 friends.\nMeanwhile 30% of Millennials say they 'always or often feel lonely.'\nAccording to the New York Daily News,\n\nEven if younger Americans are overstating their isolation, the jarring numbers reflect long-term rising trends in loneliness.

The S&P 500 dropped nearly 3% to 2,844.74. The Nasdaq Composite lagged, falling 3.5% to 7,726.04. It was the worst percentage drop for all three indexes this year. The S&P 500 is now more than 6% below its record hit only last month.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell for a sixth straight session, its longest losing streak since late 2016. The S&P 500 also posted a six-day losing streak. The Dow declined for a fifth straight day. The move continues a sell-off that began last week when President Donald Trump ordered new tariffs on the rest of Chinese goods and the Federal Reserve failed to signal it would be as aggressive as the market hoped in backstopping the economic slowdown.\n\nApple led the decline in stocks that have the most to lose from the new round of tariffs, losing 5.2%. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) closed 2.2% lower as the new tariffs will hit items apparel, electronics and toys. Nike dropped 2.7%. Macy’s and Best Buy pulled back 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nFedEx dropped 4%. Caterpillar and Boeing dropped 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively. Semiconductor stocks such as Micron Technology, Skyworks Solutions and Advanced Micro Devices fell at least 4.4%.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/us-futures-amid-trade-turmoil-between-beijing-and-washington.html",

Other issues of contention include the protection of intellectual property rights in China and Chinese exports of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances, which U.S. officials say is the main source of a drug blamed for opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States.

The ministry’s statement said the drills, which North Korea sees as an invasion rehearsal, leave the country “compelled to develop, test and deploy the powerful physical means essential for national defense.”\n\nMoar:\nhttps://apnews.com/76323ab157794d04bb5c5d89596c3ac1\n==PARENTS CATCH FBI IN PLOT TO FORCE MENTALLY ILL SON TO BE A RIGHT WING TERRORIST (2018)\nCHUPACABRE HERE\n\nPARENTS CATCH FBI IN PLOT TO FORCE MENTALLY ILL SON TO BE A RIGHT WING TERRORIST\n\nthelastamericanvagabond.com/psychological-operations/parents-catch-fbi-plot-force-mentally-ill-son-right-wing-terrorist/\nNOTABLE\n\n#PARENTS CATCH FBI IN PLOT TO FORCE MENTALLY ILL SON TO BE A RIGHT WING TERRORIST\nTHE PARENTS OF A SEVERELY MENTALLY DISABLED MAN ARE SPEAKING OUT ON HOW THE FBI GROOMED HIM AS A RIGHT-WING TERRORIST, KNOWING HE’S PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC.\nOriginally Released 08/17/17 – (TFTP) It’s become a near-weekly occurrence. Somewhere in some state, the FBI will announce that they’ve foiled yet another terrorist plot and saved lives. However, as the data shows, the majority of these cases involve psychologically diminished patsies who’ve been entirely groomed, armed, and entrapped by FBI agents. Simply put, the FBI manufactures terror threats and then takes credit for stopping them.\n\nWhile many of these cases have garnered attention and been exposed in the alternative media, a recent case out of Oklahoma sets a new low for FBI and exposes how insidious these plots can be.\n\nThrough the hundreds of ‘foiled terror plots’ the FBI has ‘busted’ over the years, many of them have been focused on people of Middle Eastern descent or people associated with ISIS or al-Qaeda.

By airline standards, the aircraft is old - it's first flight was in 1973.\nTo put that into perspective, Air New Zealand's 747 -200s, which they first flew in 1981, were retired from the airlines fleet in 2000 at the age of 19 years. The E4B is still flying at the ripe old age of 45 years.\nThe Boeing E4 was built to be a mobile command post for the president of the United States, even in the event of nuclear war. It's designed to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion and remaine completely intact. Because of this, its become known as the 'Doomsday Plane'.\nOn top of being essentially a flying bunker for the US president, the aircraft is also part of the massive, behind-the-scenes contingency planning that goes into any presidential visit.\n...\nhttps://www.newshub.co.nz/home/travel/2019/08/five-facts-about-the-boeing-e4b-doomsday-plane.html\nhttp://archive.is/IKcFo\n\n==TOM FITTON SUES\nTom Fitton @TomFitton @JudicialWatch\nSues over California Law Requiring Presidential Candidates Appearing on Primary Ballot to Disclose Tax Returns - @RealDonaldTrump\nhttps://twitter.com/TomFitton/status/1158423368967892993\n\n==TRAGEDY AVERTED\nFeds Say They Have Thwarted a Mass Shooting Plot In Lubbock, Texas\nhttps://breaking911.com/tragedy-averted-feds-say-they-have-thwarted-a-mass-shooting-plot-in-lubbock-texas/\n\n==Keep Eyes on\nhttps://poal.co/s/QStorm/\nhttps://voat.co/v/QRV\nhttps://breaking911.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/TomFitton\nhttps://twitter.com/thehill\nhttps://twitter.com/ #qanon #wwg1wga\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\n\n==Brazilian Gang Leader dresses like woman, escape thwarted (twatt video demasking)\nCheck it out: twitter.com/i/status/1158133342052728832\n\n==The Declining Empire Of Chaos Is Going Nuts Over Iran\nAuthored by Federico Pieraccini via The Strategic Culture Foundation,\nThe transition in recent years from a unipolar to a multipolar world order has created international tensions that seem to threaten to escalate into clashes between regional and global powers.\nIn 2014 we were almost at the point of no return in Ukraine following the coup d’etat supported and funded by NATO and involving extremist right-wing Ukrainian nationalists. The conflict in the Donbass risked escalating into a conflict between NATO and the Russian Federation, every day in the summer and autumn of 2014 threatening to be doomsday. Rather than respond to the understandable impulse to send Russian troops into Ukraine to defend the population of Donbass, Putin had the presense of mind to pursue the less direct and more sensible strategy of supporting the material capacity of the residents of Donbass to resist the depredations of the Ukrainian army and their neo-Nazi Banderite thugs. Meanwhile, Europe’s inept leaders initially egged on Ukraine’s destabilization, only to get cold feet after reflecting on the possibility of having a conflict between Moscow and Washington fought on European soil.\nMoar here:\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-08-05/declining-empire-chaos-going-nuts-over-iran",

Studies have indicated that loneliness has myriad negative mental and physical health effects.\n\n“Strong social relationships support mental health, and that ties into better immune function, reduced stress and less cardiovascular activation,” Debra Umberson, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas, told Time magazine in 2015.\n\nOddly, 25% of Millennials surveyed also said they don't have any acquaintances.\n\nIs social media to blame? As the Daily News points out, \"a 2018 study out of the University of Pennsylvania linked usage of apps like Facebook and Instagram to social isolation. “Using less social media than you normally would leads to significant decreases in both depression and loneliness,” the study’s author, psychologist Melissa Hunt, said at the time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, according to Vox, many 30-somethings have a hard time making new friends as they get older, as their lives become busier and friends move away.\n\nMore recently, in a 2016 paper, researchers in Germany found a peak of loneliness in a sample of 16,000 Germans at around age 30, another around age 50, and then increasing again at age 80.\n\n“We don’t quite know why this is happening,” said Maike Luhmann, a psychologist who researches loneliness at Ruhr-Universität Bochum and co-authored the paper. -Vox\n\nMoar:\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-08-05/22-millennials-say-they-have-no-friends\n\n==Treasury designates China as a currency manipulator\nTreasury designates China as a currency manipulator (Politico)\n\nBy DOUG PALMER and BEN WHITE 08/05/2019 09:54 AM EDT Updated 08/05/2019 07:51 PM EDT\nThe United States took the rare step on Monday of formally labeling China a currency manipulator, as trade relations between the two countries continued to spiral downward after President Donald Trump's decision last week to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n\"In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past,\" the Treasury Department said in a statement that followed the People's Bank of China's decision to let its currency, the renminbi, fall to the lowest level in more than a decade.\n\nMoar:\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/05/trump-blasts-china-yuan-drop-as-currency-manipulation-1634502\n\n==Dow plunges 760 points in worst day of 2019 as trade war intensifies\nDow plunges 760 points in worst day of 2019 as trade war intensifies\n\nFred Imbert\nPublished Sun, Aug 4 2019 11:55 PM EDTUpdated 5 hours ago\n\nStocks fell sharply Monday as a trade war between the world’s largest economies intensified with China retaliating against President Donald Trump’s latest move.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 767.27 points, or 2.9%, to close at 25,717.74 and dropped as much as 961.63 points at one point. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 3% to 2,844.74. The Nasdaq Composite lagged, falling 3.5% to 7,726.04. It was the worst percentage drop for all three indexes this year. The S&P 500 is now more than 6% below its record hit only last month.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell for a sixth straight session, its longest losing streak since late 2016. The S&P 500 also posted a six-day losing streak. The Dow declined for a fifth straight day. The move continues a sell-off that began last week when President Donald Trump ordered new tariffs on the rest of Chinese goods and the Federal Reserve failed to signal it would be as aggressive as the market hoped in backstopping the economic slowdown.\n\nApple led the decline in stocks that have the most to lose from the new round of tariffs, losing 5.2%. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) closed 2.2% lower as the new tariffs will hit items apparel, electronics and toys. Nike dropped 2.7%. Macy’s and Best Buy pulled back 3.1% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nFedEx dropped 4%. Caterpillar and Boeing dropped 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively. Semiconductor stocks such as Micron Technology, Skyworks Solutions and Advanced Micro Devices fell at least 4.4%.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/us-futures-amid-trade-turmoil-between-beijing-and-washington.html",

Other issues of contention include the protection of intellectual property rights in China and Chinese exports of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances, which U.S. officials say is the main source of a drug blamed for opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States.

The ministry’s statement said the drills, which North Korea sees as an invasion rehearsal, leave the country “compelled to develop, test and deploy the powerful physical means essential for national defense.”\n\nMoar:\nhttps://apnews.com/76323ab157794d04bb5c5d89596c3ac1",

Somewhere in some state, the FBI will announce that they’ve foiled yet another terrorist plot and saved lives. However, as the data shows, the majority of these cases involve psychologically diminished patsies who’ve been entirely groomed, armed, and entrapped by FBI agents. Simply put, the FBI manufactures terror threats and then takes credit for stopping them.\n\nWhile many of these cases have garnered attention and been exposed in the alternative media, a recent case out of Oklahoma sets a new low for FBI and exposes how insidious these plots can be.\n\nThrough the hundreds of ‘foiled terror plots’ the FBI has ‘busted’ over the years, many of them have been focused on people of Middle Eastern descent or people associated with ISIS or al-Qaeda. This time, in the case of Jerry Drake Varnell, the 23-year-old diagnosed schizophrenic, accused of attempting to bomb a bank, the FBI fomented terror from a right wing dialogue.\n\nIn a June meeting with the agent, according to FBI documents, Varnell described himself as a believer in “Three Percenter” ideology, a right-wing group claiming to be committed to standing against and exposing corruption and injustice.\n\nhttp://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/psychological-operations/parents-catch-fbi-plot-force-mentally-ill-son-right-wing-terrorist/\n\n==PDJT Twatts and corresponding Qdrops off timestamps, VERY COOL\n>>8503695\nCheck it, timestamps on each of last PDJT twatts:\n\n>>8503685\n>>8503681\n>>8503673\n\nand the most important one of all below:\n\n112\nWhy the Chans\nAnonymous\n5 Nov 2017 - 10:46:24 PM\nImportant to archive.\nAbove & next drops have high probability of shutting down /pol/.\nIt is being safeguarded for these transmissions but not 100% secure.\nWho owns /pol/?\nWhy is this platform being used?\nWhat recent events almost occurred re: /pol/?\nWhy is this relevant?\nStay alert in main US cities (DC), sporting events, and other conservative gatherings.\nRepeat.\nStay alert in main US cities (DC), sporting events, and other conservative gatherings.\nMore false flags imminent.\nElections (tues) no longer matter at this stage.\nSnow White.\nGodfather III.\nAbove will have context as news unfolds.\nSummarize and paint the picture.\nCritical.\nQ\n\n==\n>>8503798 >>8503857 Philippines say 8ch is run out of their country\nBaker Change\nFilipino MSM is saying that 8ch is actually run out of their country and they are considering legal action\ncan't post the link directly here but\none article is from ABS-CBN News and is titled \"Police checking Philippines link of 8ch tagged in US shooting\"\n\n==\n>>8503921 8ch up but not awake\nHEY HEY HEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nBACK UP!?!\nhttp://206.223.147.214/qresearch/res/7347564.html\n\n==\n>>8504092 Jim Watkins statement (vid)\nJim Watkins statement CMs dad\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKPdbEAmWGE [Embed]\n\n==\n>>8504310 Anon theory on the DS and Chan\n>>8504010\nLucky no one knows about it then, kek.\nand\n>>8504092\no7\nThis is a king hit by the establishment for sure.

			"body": "Posted in First General thread (some kind of ghost ebake) the following very important, very relevant information:\n\n1. Potus retweets a 2 month old Dday tweet.\n2. Scavino posts cryptic photo on facebook with never before seen meme of Trump and \"THE END\" showing in the mirror.\n\nThe scavino one is weird cus the photographer is showing in the shot... so it's obvious that they didn't crop it on purpose. Read between the lines, it's go time anons.\n\nSauces:\nScavino pic - https://www.facebook.com/DanScavino/photos/a.1963839477165112/2353659208183135/?type=3&theater\n\nTrump tweet - https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\nLook at his retweet from around 7amCT\n...................\nSCAVINO PHOTO - what do we see?\nScavino pic w/ photog showing is reminiscent of Rachel Chandler's Self Portrait Marfa journal.\n>pic related\nThe photog showing themselves IN the picture is very intentional. Who is the photographer here? Looks an awful lot like RC!! (see >>ab637c21-929c-4e53-a8be-7b1054eedb18 first photo)\n\nThe images around the bottom of the mirror and up the side are added in later (not reflections) obviously of people and places - too small for me to really see clearly. BUT - there is a large, large photo with POTUS on it with arm outstretched, black background and the word \"The End\"\n\nSome are outside (top left- 3 people),\none on bottom left corner & center look like in oval office, and\nbottom right looks like medal of honor ceremony or something\n\nPhoto right behind man at desk - that's (POTUS with very messy hair?) and someone with dark hair, glasses & a beard and a woman who looks like Sara Huckabee Sanders. What's on the tv screen behind the man with messy blonde hair?\nBehind that photo, on its side is a POTUS tweet - visible text says line 1- Thanks-many, line 2- character write, line 3- it's fun.\nwill have to enlarge & sharpen to see the date on tweet\nThere is a POTUS' name on the white hard hat on the right.\nAbove the large photo of POTUS (\"The End\") there is a monitor with 4 network news channels, sort of like RC's with the multi-channel surveillance re: Epstein... able to watch multiple \"channels\" at the same time.\n\nThere's more to be seen, but better eyes will have to look!\n\nINITIAL APPLICATION:\nPerson sent to document (photographer) man at desk (working hard) - POTUS communicates with us by various means (tweets, photos), is for the People (hard hat) and working hard to rebuild our Country (Presidential seal high on wall behind photog) with many other people (people outside photos, people in Oval Office photos, etc.) in different positions, with a lot of surveillance (monitor on wall with 4 different rooms/scenes) / knows what's going on and tries to let us know in different ways. Photo 2 men, woman are in that same room, with the mirror on the wall and the 3 people all watching the monitor (looks like 1 channel, very blurry).\n\nWhat about that POTUS tweet?\nTWEET TEXT:\n>As we commemorate #DDay75, let us give thanks for the valiant Allied Soldiers who helped turn the tide of the Second World War on that fateful day.\n\n\nWhat jumps out immediately:\n>thanks to the valiant Allied soldiers\n>helped turn the tide\n< 3rd meme war\n>fateful day\n\n\nAPPLY:\nPOTUS is thanking his valiant soldiers in the Alliance (all those anons out in the world who follow Q, anons/autists & awesome people), who are helping to turn the tide in this 3rd World War (meme war, and war against the /cabal/) on this fateful day (the day they thought they could strangle us by cutting off 8ch!).\n\nRE-APPLY\nPOTUS sees a lot and is behind Q, is letting us know he's watching, appreciates our efforts as his allied soldiers in this fight, is working hard to communicate with us in unconventional (but brilliant) ways. He hopes we understand the comms and think it's also fun, we are a bunch of characters, men and women, both outside (the system) and inside (undercover Patriots). POTUS is reaching out to tell us this is not the end for US but for them.",

Lindsey Graham, leading separate inquiries into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, have obtained an audio deposition of Joseph Mifsud, the mysterious Maltese academic who claimed Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe revelation about Mifsud came from The Hill’s John Solomon, who spoke with Sean Hannity on Fox News last Thursday. Solomon’s widely reported bombshell last week was that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz had criminally referred former FBI James Comey to the DOJ because of his alleged leaking of classified information in his memos and a lack of candor with investigators, but the DOJ declined prosecution.\n\nBut this tidbit about Mifsud made fewer headlines.\n<snip>\nMifsud’s alleged attorney Stephan Roh said in late July that Durham intended to interview Mifsud. He said that if an interview failed to pan out, Durham's team at least wanted to view a recorded deposition Mifsud gave in 2018 on his role in the Trump-Russia controversy. Roh said he would provide at least one page of the deposition to Durham's investigators.\n\nSolomon told Hannity that Durham’s team “obtained an audiotaped deposition of Joseph Mifsud, where he describes his work, why he targeted Papadopoulos, who directed him to do that, what directions he was given, and why he set that entire process of introducing George Papadopoulos to Russia in motion in March of 2016.”\n\nSolomon called the meeting between Papadopoulos and Mifsud “really the flash point, the starting point of this whole Russia collusion narrative.” And Solomon said Graham “has also obtained the same deposition.”\n\n“So you now have the Senate and a federal prosecutor,” Solomon said.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_dj-3eqPNvo",

Illegals everywhere don't know who's undercover ICE, who isn't? Have no idea who in their area/community is aware of them, how close ICE is to a roundup there?\nNo idea how secure they are in that location?\nNow if POTUS is having ICE to actual roundups in various locations, this is helpful.\nEven the false alarms of ICE roundups add to this feeling of insecurity.\nIf enough people do this innocent thing, how many decide it's not worth it, and decide to voluntarily self-deport.",

			"body": "8Chan Refugees Blow Their Anonymity\n\nRefugees from the anonymous 8chan forum are flooding into a new censorship-resistant home on the dark web, and inadvertently giving up their anonymity along the way.\nA reincarnated version of the hate-filled forum, now linked to three mass shootings, appeared Monday when the original 8chan lost its hosting service. The new site, called 08chan (with a leading zero), has no affiliation with the original and it’s not entirely clear who set it up, but 8chan’s diaspora have been flooding in as word of the site spreads through right-wing social media.\nThe distinguishing feature of the new site is that it lives on ZeroNet, a peer-to-peer network designed by information activists to allow for uncensorable websites immune from government or corporate intervention. Instead of relying on a central server, a ZeroNet site is hosted in bits and pieces by everyone browsing it, making it virtually impossible to shut down.\n“Hard as they try, they will never stop us,” enthused one poster to the white supremacist “/pol/” board on 08chan. “We are smarter and more innovative.”\n“The old 8chan site may be ashes, but this is the phoenix egg buried beneath,” another wrote.\nThere’s just one catch. Peer-to-peer networks expose a user’s internet address to anyone who cares to look. That’s how copyright lawyers catch people trading movies, music and software, and it’s how police and FBI agents arrest pedophiles trading child porn online.\n\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/8chan-users-migrating-to-zeronet-are-accidentally-revealing-their-locations\n\n\nand with this Baker is OUT\ncome to nchan/qanonresearch\n\nsooo comfy\n",
