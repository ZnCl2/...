Another problem, some even think stuff is posted, while in reality it isn't, if they still use old 08chan ID.",

Thumbnails for videos will appear as white boxes if you leave it at default settings. You need to sacrifice a bit of security and set certain `resistFingerprinting` settings in `about:config` to '''false''', just like it was the case for image posting with the older version of Millchan, or simply use some other browser. The same goes for performance, try different browsers and see if there is a difference.

Otherwise, you can turn this scenario around - VeraCrypt can be used to hide your ZeroNet instance, either on file container, partition, volume, hidden volume or some spare portable drive. The data appears random and can't reveal VeraCrypt was used. It may raise some questions if you have it installed or unpacked somewhere, but they can't prove anything.
