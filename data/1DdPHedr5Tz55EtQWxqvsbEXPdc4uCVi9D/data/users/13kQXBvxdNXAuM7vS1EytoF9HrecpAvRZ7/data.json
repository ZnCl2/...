For sake of post lets amuse shill. The tactic here is by Muting everyone right away asumed to be a shill it leaves the muters ignorant of thier actions on the sight which will be detrimental to those new or not well informed. These post will go ignored as if nothing is worng with them leading a new comer to think that this is common belief here. If the shill baits us into never muting anyone it leaves us open to spammers and cp posters. The best thing to do here is have a good sense of reasoning and patience. Have a very convincing collection of info to reply to each attempt at shilling. And only mute during the most severe of circumstances. Rampent muting will ultmetly split this sight in half between shills and fooled sheep and \"oldfags\" with shills mainting full view of what is going on in the sight while \"oldfags\" have blinded themselves.\n\nEDIT couldnt clearly see OP image attached, that seems like a good way to deal with shills for thos not patient enough to ignore them\n",
