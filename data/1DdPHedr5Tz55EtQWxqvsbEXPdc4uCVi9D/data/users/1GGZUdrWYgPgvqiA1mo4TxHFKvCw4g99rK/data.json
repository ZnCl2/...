Prove it\n\nThis one was a little hyperbolic, but it refers to the changes made in the recent reveal video. It may be in development, but they decided to show it in this state, without clarifying that it was only representative of the cc mechanic.\n\n'''Remember:''' ''the disclaimer only says that it's not representative of the final look of the game''. We cannot assume that CDPR means anything outside of the words they've said, otherwise we have a repeat of the TPP/FPP cutscene controversy.",

From what I gather, most people were upset that they'd hardly get to see their character, and supposedly they promised that you could switch from FPP to TPP at will. Obviously, this has changed and has resulted in the excuses seen in pic related.\nhttp://archive.is/ehIYw",
