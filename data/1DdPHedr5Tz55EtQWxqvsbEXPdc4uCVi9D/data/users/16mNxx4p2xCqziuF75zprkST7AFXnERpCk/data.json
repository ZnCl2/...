Which is how the Fed will be doing it too.",

Putting that aside Mute is too much of a hassle to get rid to deal with on a regular basis unless Acidman decides to put in an unmute function, so it is a lot more semi-permanent then a simple downvote.",

The maker is Acidman, if you wanna know who that is he is a gun store owner in the US with friends in the FBI. I know this because some discord group tried to dox and raid him but he asked his friend to take care of them.",
