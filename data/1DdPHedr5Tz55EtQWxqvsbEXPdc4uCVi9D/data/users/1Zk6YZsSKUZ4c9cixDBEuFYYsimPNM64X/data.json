Clean/delete VMs regularly. \n\nUse a VPN and TOR.\n\nA lot rests on if the VPN provider keeps logs. So finding a good provider is good. One that shares IPs is good too because it provides some deniability. \n\nPay for VPN in crypto. \n\nSpoof useragent and use private browsing to mitigate client fingerprinting. \n\nIt all depends who you are defending against. If you are defending against just your local network(say your work/school) then a VPN is fine. It is good to run TOR over a VPN so the ISP cant see you running TOR. It is also good to run your own VPN on your own VPS. \n\nIt is good to change things a lot. To prevent fingerprinting",
