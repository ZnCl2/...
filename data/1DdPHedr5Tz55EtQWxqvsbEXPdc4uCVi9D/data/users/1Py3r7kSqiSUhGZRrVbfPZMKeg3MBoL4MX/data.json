They aren't exactly hugely great either.\nNone of them are really standout. I'd call 8 very mediocre actually.\n8 was and still functions very well as a \"babbys first FE\", even if it was removed from its pedestal by awakening. \nGBA era is definitely not something i'd call a golden age. \n\nThe DS and 3DS stuff does not work as a functional group despite the DS stuff clearly being the baseline for awakening.\nShadow Dragon is not a common choice for anyone, nor is it a particularly player catering one.\nI would say its sequel is very much similar despite the avatar.**something like Kris isn't as retardedly broken when you don't have shit like pair-up and skills on the side**\n**Conquest also kinda doesn't work for the category, while i've never played normal for it i'd probably guess that its actually less newbie friendly than most of the GBA games**\n\nJudging by what you dislike you probably don't get how stuff like 4/5 are meant to be played; they aren't meant to be played fairly, they aren't made for people who don't use their tools to the fullest. \n**of course this could just be a matter of taste**",
