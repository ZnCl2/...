Is this snapshot taken from some kind of alternative to Facebook? Also, if democrats are the ones that fight for more government programs to help black people, why would a democrat go into a place populated by ethnic minorities and start blasting? And then, there's the change in his profile after the shooting. Did he self-report this and then the changes were made later by someone else?\n\nWho is this mysterious \"Q Anon\" I keep reading about all the time?\n\nThe most confusing thing of all: what was the purpose of the shooting and through what steps was the purpose fulfilled?\n\nWhat do we know about the Dayton and Ohio shootings? Can I ask about those in this thread or is that off-topic?",

Michael Jones is a Catholic however I don't think you should dismiss what he has to say regarding the Jews on that basis since he believes the Church and society at large has been corrupted by their influence. His opinions are such that you don't need to be a Christian to believe what he's saying.",

The second King kind of just goes with the flow the first King established. Something like that. Then, the Third King is completely apathetic to what both the preceding Kings have done and is generally a corrupt degenerate. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?",
