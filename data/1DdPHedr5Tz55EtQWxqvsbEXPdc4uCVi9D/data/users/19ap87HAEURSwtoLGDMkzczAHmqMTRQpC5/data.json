Which authority would verify the users for the captcha whitelist? \nMy thoughts would be network consensus, and a distributed database of ID's that users can query to generate the captchas. \nA possible weakness of this is certificate farming, we need some kind of limit to the lifetime of ID's. We also need the client to remember blacklists and board pins no matter the ID.",
