Can you try and not sound like a total retard when you type something out?\n\nThe only discernible thing I can make of this is that you are attempting to deny climate change: I assume, the two links you have provided are you proof of this.\n\nI will read over them, but, I am willing to bet money they aren't very reliable. As for the image you've posted it lacks any context or source, so, i'm just going to ignore that.\n\nThe fact is that we can see a clear rise in co2 emmisons after the industrial revolution and a warming trend of the planet. Yes, the earth does go through warming and cooling cycles, but, we have never experienced ones quite as intense as these that we are experiencing right now.\n\nFurthermore, it's just common sense. C02 is a heavy gas that remains in the atmosphere. Everything we do to support society right now burns more and more c02. It's just common sense that it would build up in the atmosphere; c02 keeps more and more sunlight in.\n\nBeing a climate denier is like being a flat earther. You just have to understand nothing about either position to be duped by it.\n\nThen again, I guess even flat earth is too crazy for massive corporations to spend billions of dollars every year lobbying in favor of.",
