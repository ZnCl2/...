Using them as backup CDN in case the decentralized network cant deliver a file, which e-hentai does, is a perfectly viable hybrid solution. The reason the site shutdown cut off access to all of the content distributed through H@H was because the front end is hosted on the same servers as the content. If you want to to avoid that in the future, the front end needs to be easily movable and have easy to deploy copies available in case shit really hits the fan.\n\nBut, you say, in a decentralized system like hydrus or what have you every node is its own access point. True, but ideally still want people without the software to access the content. Whether it's just a private node accessing the network or a front end shouldn't matter. But yeah, trying to move ehentai's entire library onto a decentralized network needs coordination by a central force, or at least agreed upon guidelines, howto's and recommended software. \nUnless we have settled on  those, the content will remain in jeopardy.",

Pedophilia isn't by definition harmful, but it defacto would be, since you cannot test whether a kid is sexually mature enough to not be taken advantage of. Sure, there are rare cases where pedofaggotry happens and nobody gets hurt, but there's only an infinitesimally small percentage of kids that are mature enough at that age, or younger. They exist, but you testing if a kid is mature enough is harmful by merely exposing them to these subject matters. If one out of a million kids is mature enough, you'd have to risk potentially affecting any of the 999.999 others negatively. \n\nBefore you go campaigning for pedo rights, you'd be better off trying to decriminalize possession and distribution of cp, so the government has one less trump cart to ruin anyone's life with a single picture.",
