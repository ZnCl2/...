There are two large problems that need to be addressed to this end: First, is being able to secure some platform or means of economically paying creators for whatever they do. Given today's political pressure from \"soft\" (i.e. corporations) and \"hard\" (i.e. governments) bodies, anything associated with banks, credit card companies, or intermediaries, like Paypal, are out. This leaves cryptocurrency as the only feasible option, given its p2p nature of handling transactions; no governments or banks needed, therefore no one to separate the content creators from their earnings. The downsides at the moment are the market volatility of many cryptocurrencies and the new nature of the technology; namely, the fact that people have a reasonable understanding of how fiat currencies and banks work, but less so of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, which ultimately means they will be more wary of adopting the technology. Perhaps this will change with newer generations as these ideas trickle down and begin getting taught at schools.\n\nThe second main problem is securing a platform to sell or advertise the product or company. Speaking mainly from a digital perspective, this requires the use of ''alternative'' social media and video hosting; though places like Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and Reddit reach an enormous number of people, they are quick to censor wrongthink (\"soft\" political pressure). Supporting, or even taking ownership (via mass immigration of politically like-minded users), of places like Bitchute, Minds, and so forth, would attain this end, with the upside that it would also secure a means of distributing memes, information, and redpills into the clearnet and the places we have been forbidden to post our ideas on. \n\nBasically, we need decentralized payments to circumvent a third party from economically choking white companies, and a mixture of decentralized and clearnet advertising/distribution platforms; the former to similarly prevent censorship, and the latter to attract more people into the white economy.",

Anons have to stick together during these dark times.**\n\nIn regards to your plans, **the voice SIM that people on a tourist visa are allowed to buy doesn't have a working cell number - only gaijins on a long-term (> 3 months) can apply - so you're right in thinking that it won't work. Another potential issue is that some of these websites will only accept credit/debit cards issued in Japan (some don't even accept Paypal; Melonbooks is an example, which is why you have tons of middle-men companies that \"purchase\" the stuff you want on your behalf and then send it to you for an additional handling fee). Provided you can purchase the item, for outlets that have an agreement with a konbini (i.e. Amazon), pick-up is easy: Typically, you receive an email with some code numbers which you enter at one of the touch-screen kiosks. Then, a receipt is printed out which you present to the counter in exchange for your package; only thing that may be required is ID. However, I largely suspect the process is only easy because it is assumed that the person picking up the package is a long-term resident of Japan, though I might be wrong.**\n\nFeel free to ask more questions; I've been here for a couple of months, however, my nip progress is almost non-existent. This language is fucking hard, man; I can't remember this shit after working a long day. You can actually live in Japan without knowing a word of Japanese.",

An old telecom's law demands permanent numbers can only be doled out to long term residents. Maybe you could just use the number of the place you are staying, because all correspondence typically goes through email anyway.**\n**Looking at the payment section of the website (see section お支払い here: https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/clipboard/) it appears you might also be able pay at a convenience store or \"post-pay\" when you pick your package up; a back-up for if your credit card doesn't get accepted. \"Post-pay\" is a similar process to picking up a package as I reiterated in my previous post, except you settle the amount at the convenience store rather than online.**\n**Depends on your definition of \"die\"; if you mean being faced with postal workers who probably won't speak a word of English, then likely. However, they should be able to figure out what you want if you present your ID and say 「パッケージを集めます。」 - \"pakkeji wo atsumemasu\" - \"I'm collecting a package\".
