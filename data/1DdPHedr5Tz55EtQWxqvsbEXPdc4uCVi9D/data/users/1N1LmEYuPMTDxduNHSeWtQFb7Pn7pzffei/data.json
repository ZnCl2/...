Fifty-three healthy volunteers were selected on the basis of MRI scans and classified into four groups according to presence or absence of the PCS in their left or right hemisphere. The group with absence of the PCS in both hemispheres showed significantly reduced reality monitoring performance and ability to introspect metacognitively about their performance when compared with other participants. Consistent with the prediction that sulcal absence might mean greater volume in the surrounding frontal gyri, voxel-based morphometry revealed a significant negative correlation between anterior PFC gray matter and reality monitoring performance. The findings provide evidence that individual differences in introspective abilities like reality monitoring may be associated with specific structural variability in the PFC.\n\n>Specific PCS reductions have been observed in schizophrenia (Noga et al., 1995; Fornito et al., 2006b) with one study, for example, reporting complete absence bilaterally in 44% of schizophrenia patients, compared with 27% of controls (Yücel et al., 2002b).\n\n>The computer-based reality monitoring memory task was adapted from that used by Simons et al. (2006, 2008). The stimuli consisted of 160 well known word pairs (e.g., “Jekyll and Hyde,” “Yin and Yang”). There were five blocks in total, each block containing a study and test phase. In the study phase, the first word to appear at the top of the screen was “SUBJECT” or “EXPERIMENTER,” indicating who was to read out loud the word pair that would subsequently be presented in the center of the screen. After 500 ms, either a word pair (Jekyll and Hyde: perceive condition) or the first word in the word pair and a question mark (Jekyll and ?: imagine condition) were shown. In the perceive condition, the subject or the experimenter read the word pair aloud. In the imagine condition, the subject or experimenter imagined the word that completed the pair and vocalized the whole word pair. Stimuli assignments to subject/experimenter and perceive/imagine conditions were counterbalanced between subjects, and the trial order was pseudorandomized such that no more than three consecutive trials were of the same condition.\n\n>Immediately following each study phase, participants' reality monitoring ability was assessed in a test phase. To test participants' recollection of whether they themselves or another person had read each word pair aloud, the following cue was presented: “Did either you or the experimenter read this word pair aloud?” Participants were then shown the first word of the word pair (e.g., Jekyll) in the center of the display with a reminder instruction underneath, and were instructed to press “1” on the keyboard if they thought they had read the pair in the study phase, and “2” if they believed the experimenter had read it aloud. To test participants' ability to discriminate between perceived and imagined information, they were first shown the cue: “Was the accompanying word either perceived or imagined?” and were told to press “1” if they believed that the second word had been presented, or “2” if they thought that the accompanying word had been imagined. For each response, participants indicated how confident they were by holding down the response key as a confidence bar at the bottom of the screen increased in size. Participants had 4.5 s to start making their response. The type of recollection cued for each item and the ordering of test conditions were systematically counterbalanced between subjects.\n\n>Because our a priori prediction was that reduced reality monitoring would be seen in individuals with bilateral PCS absence, performance of participants in the a-a group was compared statistically with other participants using independent-samples t tests (Stuss et al., 2005). Effect sizes were computed using Cohen's d (Cohen, 1988). Reality monitoring accuracy is displayed in Figure 3, from which it can be seen that, as predicted, participants in the a-a group performed significantly worse overall than those in the other groups (t(52) = 2.03, p < 0.05, d = 0.65). Performance broken down by condition (Table 1) indicated that this effect was significant for recollection of self/experimenter status (t(52) = 2.08, p < 0.05, d = 0.66), but not for perceived/imagined recollection (t(52) = 1.56, p = 0.125, d = 0.5), although there was no interaction (F(1,51) = 0.11, p = 0.75). The reality monitoring accuracy reduction occurred despite no significant differences between the a-a group and other participants in reaction times, either across all trials or focusing just on correct responses (all t(52) <1, d < 0.13).",
