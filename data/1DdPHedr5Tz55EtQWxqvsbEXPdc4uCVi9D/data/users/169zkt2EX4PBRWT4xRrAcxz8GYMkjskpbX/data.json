As an operating system, the Jewish religion and the Jewish cultural identity are fundamentally incompatible with bedrock Western culture and render those who are running the operating system highly antagonistic to many founding principles of traditional Western civilization.\nWestern culture exalts strength and honor, while Jewish culture exalts the weak and treats honor as at best something that applies only during interactions with other Jews. Western culture believes at some level in universal morality while Jewish culture again treats morality as something that is pliable depending on who one is dealing with.\nAs long as they continue to cling to such a system of incompatible values, they will forever be parasitic outsiders who take more than they contribute. Deconstructing their own value system to live in harmony with the West would require the Jews to give up their central conceit of being \"the Chosen\" at which point they would effectively cease to be Jews.\nThat is why this is a struggle to the death: the only form of reconciliation is for either for Western men or the Jews to completely give up their identity. Jewish intellectuals of the Rabbinical tradition understand this well which is why they are perpetually worried about their extermination and constantly try and deprive the Western man of his identity.\nThey know that this is a battle to the death that has been more than 2,000 years in the making. The game is winner-take-all and the stakes are unbelievably high.",

One thing that comes to mind is giving a fraction of each post fee to the OP as an incentive for creating threads with sustained activity.\nIf the content can be made better through some well-tweaked system of monetary incentives, users will pay for the privilege of participation as well as the possibility of being rewarded themselves.\nAs for the glowniggers/shills having funds to continue their subversion: that will be less of an issue the larger things scale. Even an organization with deep pockets would have to stretch their funds to compete with 10s of thousands of legit posters, and if we ever got to 100s of thousands or millions of users, subversion by a single entity will become very, very costly.  \n>Nevermind the fact that Bitcoin is a pain in the ass to get ahold of in some areas without doxing yourself to some kike middleman company\nThis is IMO the weakest argument you make here. There are more ways than ever of getting crypto without leaving a trail. It used to be Local Bitcoins was the only game in town. They now have obnoxious kyc rules in place but that has just resulted in more anonymous alternatives springing up all over the place.",
