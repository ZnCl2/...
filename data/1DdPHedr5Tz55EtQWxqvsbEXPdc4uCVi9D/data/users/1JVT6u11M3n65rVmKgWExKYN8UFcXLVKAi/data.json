I call this \"mod streams\". I think we should begin to implement this functionality right now and not when we're under attack and can't even coordinate effectively.\nThe power of blacklisting shouldn't rely only on the site owner. Mainly because he's not necessarily the entity with most amount of resources (free time basically) to tag spam posts, but also because some other people might not consider spam some of what he decides to blacklist. You can disable blacklists, but then you have to look at ALL the blacklisted stuff that was ever posted, even if you would consider some particular post spam too. This wouldn't be an issue with mod streams that could be subscribed to by the user and would implement certain policies aligned with the user.\nAnyone who wants to contribute to development probably should begin here https://zeronet.io/docs/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/ (after updating his install to the latest version of Millchan to familiarize himself with how the software works).\n>>098b5201-910a-400f-b699-aed520a6ecb4\nYeah, [M] is effective for video and maybe large-ish images because they're barely seeded anyway in the first place, but against text, forget it.",

With Zeronet that requirement is relaxed, because I don't think there's any IP banning functionality already implemented, and it's designed to be able to be used over Tor, so you can launch multiple instances of the service that connect to different Guards all pointing to the same board from a single IP address.\nThe biggest cost would probably be the development of good spamming scripts, and then the hardware costs because Zeronet is pretty bloated.\nSure, you can keep creating boards, but that just means you divide your userbase until you're basically left with nothing.",
