Why do you hate your people so much that you insist on living with your so-called oppressors? If you wanted to leave, you do realize that literally no one would try to stop you? That there would be no one with guns threatening your life? Why do your people get their own space, but mine don't? Why do you think it's okay to force us to live by your rules in our own land?",

It's even more imperative here to shield your IP than it would be on clearnet chans. Peer 2 Peer is great, but trackers sharing your IP is how ZeroNet functions. I've been screwing around on here for years and I promise you that there were already plenty of anarchists, Marxists, and mentally unstable types present. More will come, in pursuit of us. They're probably already maintaining a table of IPs that seed the zite. Prepare accordingly.",

Seriously? The chans existed long before Qanon was ever a thing. The majority of us have nothing to do with that stuff. EVERY manifesto gets circulated on the chans and especially pol. Even manifestos from shootings in European countries. The whole reason Qtards found their way to the chans in the first place was because, just like the rest of us, you were seeking some form of forbidden knowledge or obscure fellowship. Well guess what? Manifestos are forbidden knowledge too and we have a voracious curiosity.\n\n>>2fbdc91e-2068-43cb-8d63-66e487ce2241\n>but good luck trying to take this offline.\nZeroNet is decentralized. It unfortunately relies on trackers for peering... Meaning that until we get a configuration that implements a DHT for the site, or ZeroNet-proper finally implements the feature for the entire network, there's still realistic potential for them to cause intermittent disruptions.",
