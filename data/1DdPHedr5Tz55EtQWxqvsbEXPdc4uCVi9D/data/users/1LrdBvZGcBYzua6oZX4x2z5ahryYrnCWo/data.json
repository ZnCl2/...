Offers the first plausible explanation for Epstein's Austrian passport, which involves Ronald S. (((Lauder))) the cosmetic mogul Estee Lauder heir.\n>Though Epstein’s defense attorney declined to reveal the identity of the “friend” who provided him with the fake Austrian passport, Lauder was both well-positioned to acquire it in Austria and also deeply connected to the Mega Group, which was co-founded by Epstein’s patron Leslie Wexner and to which Epstein has many connections. These connections to both the Austrian government and to Epstein’s mentor make Lauder the most likely person to have acquired the document on Epstein’s behalf.\n>Furthermore, Epstein and the Mega Group’s ties to the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, also suggest Lauder was involved in procuring the passport, in light of his close ties to the Israeli government and the fact that Mossad has a history of using ambassadors abroad to procure false, foreign passports for its operatives.\n>In 1997, when the “Mega” spy scandal broke, Netanyahu had recently become prime minister of Israel after an upset victory, a victory that was largely credited to one well-connected Netanyahu backer in particular, Ronald Lauder. Beyond being a major donor, Lauder had brought Arthur Finklestein on to work for Netanyahu’s 1996 campaign, whose strategies were credited for Netanyahu’s surprise win.\nThe mob, mossad, mega and more.  New connections, names, and the ever present stench of kike parasites.\n>Ultimately, the picture painted by the evidence is not a direct tie to a single intelligence agency but a web linking key members of the Mega Group, politicians, and officials in both the U.S. and Israel, and an organized-crime network with deep business and intelligence ties in both nations.\nhttps://www.mintpressnews.com/mega-group-maxwells-mossad-spy-story-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/261172/\narchive.fo/PYUQo",

Anon's idea is to get free AWS and Microsoft Azure to launch VM's from, which piggyback other high bandwidth companies.  From a theoretical technical standpoint, is this possible or complete faggotry?  Anon remembers LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) being used to take MC, Visa and PayPal down temporarily.  Cloudflare relys on excessive bandwidth, but is that really immunity?",
