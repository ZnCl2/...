You have kids here playing cops and robbers, while the adults have their hands tied behind their back.\n\nNEVER thought I would ever say this :( The feds are blameless here. They are playing the game EXACTLY according to the hobble rules we inflicted upon them. Our system was never built to handle wayward children. It was always assumed that parents would keep children in check\n\nGood prescription? CITIZENS of Portland need to own this. Sick of these antifas? Then do something about it! Do it in a way that removes all excuses and leaves the feds completely untarnished. A quiet lone wolf with a homebrew suicide car bomb would do the trick. Porttland needs to extract 100 lives from these thugs with zero bystander or fed casualties. That would raise the stakes for these bullies.\n\nExtra points if those bankrolling these riots were later assassinated. Along with any local Portland civic enablers.\n\nWhen the killing starts - these riots will stop. Really is that simple. Dead antifas don't riot. You want peace? Seize their lives. Take those lives from them. Make your freaks fear you. You don't need to live like this.\n\nIf you're a native Portlander with cancer - this would be a great legacy to leave your city. \n\nAnother legacy just as important? Would remind the feds that they govern ONLY at our consent. Provides an appropriate visual example.",
