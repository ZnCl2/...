			"body": "Alright, PKI, very short primer. You have two keys, a public and a private. As you have guessed, the public is public and private is private. Without going into details, to sign something, you need your private key, and anyone who has the public key can verify whether it was signed by the corresponding private key or not.\nCerts. Using just keys, you'd need to get the public key from everyone you want to talk with using a trusted channel. So instead you create a certificate, which is basically your public key, some info (expiry date, whatever), signed by a different cert. When you have a self-signed cert, you sign the cert using itself. Since anyone can create things like that, it doesn't proove anything. Alternatively, you can have a certificate authority, which will do whatever checks he pleases then he can sign your cert with the cert authority's private key. This way you only need to get the CA's public key, and if you can trust the CA, you can trust the certs signed by him.\nNow what does this mean? Previously you used self-signed certs, so you pretty much allowed everything on the board (actually I think they're not real self-signed certs, but let's ignore it). Now that you only allow zeroid, you require each message and file and everything to be signed by a cert that is signed by zeroid. Since before nothing was signed with zeroid, everything will be invalid. It a bug/limitation on millchan/zeronet that it doesn't check the signatures of already downloaded items. That's why it works for some of you, because you didn't install zeronet in the last ~16 hours. And of course you can't say allow self-signed and zeroid certs, because then we're back at step 0, i.e. spambots. Since the messages don't have a timestamp (or at least they're easily forged), you can't say allow old messages using the old certs but not the new ones.\n",
