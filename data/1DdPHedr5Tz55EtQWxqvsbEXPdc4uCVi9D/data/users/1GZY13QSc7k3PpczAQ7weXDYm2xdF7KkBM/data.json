Don't even bother with \"no logs we swear 90% off if you bring 200 friends\" crap.\nWrap your Tor around an obfs or meek bridge from bridges.torproject.org\n99% undetectable from ISP side (and that's the only concern for a Tor user - not to give up to their ISP they're using Tor), even China can't do shit about it (other than throttle it like they throttle all outbound connections).\nDon't waste your money.",

That's why it's recommended for ZeroNet and generally it's not a bad idea to use it casually without Tor plugin as your default browser.\nAt least use Firefox, preferably with ghacks user.js. I certainly wouldn't recommend using anything Chrome with ZeroNet, because Google will definitely know you're using ZeroNet.",
