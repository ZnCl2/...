Tor Browser is better and isn't hard to configure but for noobs that are worried that they will be hunted by the feds because they used Tor you guys are good safe but you should definitely get in the hang of using Tor Browser to go on here.",

			"body": "To make matters short, Zeronet is P2P like torrent/bitcoin. Tor is enabled by default so you get some anonymity but if you want the full anonymity you should download Tor Browser.\n\n1. Download Tor\nhttps://www.torproject.org/\n\n2. Open it go to \"Tools\" then \"Options\"\n\n3. Scroll down to the very bottom of the \"Options\" page you should see \"Network Proxy\" and next to it \"settings\" click on it.\n\n3. On the \"Connection Settings\" page go to \"No proxy for\" and copy the follow: 127.0.0.1\n\n4. Click okay, and your set. Copy the Zeronet address you were on and bookmark it in Tor.\n\nAnd just like that your worries about joining the party van are gone. You can browse, download, mute or say whatever you want.\n\nTread well anons!",
