Avoid it like the plague. \n\nNow in concerns to MSG, MSG is a SUPER ADDICTIVE naturally occurring chemical, it's literally added onto crap to make it more tasty than it actually is. It's not harmful in the sense of it being carcinogenic or it being toxic, however it can do a number on brain chemistry and train your brain to crave junkfood doused in the stuff. For those of you who are fatties, this is why dropping junk food from your diet almost feels impossible, you're borderline chemically addicted to that crap.",

Here's the thing, as far as I know, there hasn't been enough studies that has pinpointed what type of fiber is the most beneficial. Whether it's the stuff that's easily water soluble, or the stuff that isn't and is practically shat out. \n\nHere's a good study that goes quite a bit into detail about which fibers potentially promote proper gut health via the mechanisms I'll explain below.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735932/\n\nNote obesity severely counteracts whatever health benefits fiber may have.\n\nBasically what is known rather concretely now, is that fibrous foods promote healthy gut fauna via the promotion of short chain fatty acids which act like a \"food source\" for gut fauna. Additionally it's been thought that SCFA have \"anti cancer\" properties by practically starving cancer cells, promoting their apoptosis via Ffar2, also it has been seen that Ffar2 also reduces colon inflammation. In addition to this the GLP-1 that is responsible for promoting proper mucosal defense mechanisms may also boost metabolical activity with more free energy being made available.\n\nSo yeah, fiber is good for you, do not discount it, specially since your diet is heavily meat based. Try to have a \"fiber only\" day where you supplant some generous amounts of the stuff into your diet.",

			"body": ">the ages 14+ are all children waaaah waaah\n\nYou guys bitch about how our modern men and women are manchildren who have no accountability of their lives. Yet here you are pushing the bullshittery that is eternal childhood via the pretense of \"adolescence\" which quite literally means GROWING ADULT. You're being GIGANTIC RETARDED FAGGOTS, a woman and man stop being children the moment they stop being prepubescent. Hell using your logic the age of consent, voting, drinking and driving should be incremented all the way to 24! After all the Male brain stops developing at the age of 24 hurrr duhyhhhrrr hurrr! Even by your cock sucking, authority of appeal to the law, the same kiked out law that forces people to give services and employment to niggers mind you, people don't magically stop being children at the magical age of 18. There are states where the AoC goes lower, down to 15 in Europe and 16 in the US!\n\nFact is, is that during the time of our grandparents, or for you younger faggots great grandparents arranged marriages were a thing. And the fiancee courting process would happen at the ages as young as 12 at times. However just because a 20~ or even 30~ year old man was in an arranged relationship with a 12-14 year old doesn't mean he would consummate the marriage. Hell no, the reason this was a thing is so the guy could train his little wife to do house chores, and until he felt she was ready then the marriage would be official and thus consummated either civilly or by the church. \n\nThis whole concept of \"teenagers\" instead of \"adolescence\" came about artificially as well. All due to the implementation of compulsory education, and eventually systematized standardization  of our education system. This whole concept was brought about quite literally due to both state as well as federal government meddling into private citizen lives. As the prerequisites for schooling grew to get a job, so did a child's, and eventually an adolescent's time grew for participating in school. You folks like to bitch about how our youth get into thousands of debt in fucking Kike Filled Universities yet refuse to look at the main reasons why this is the case.\n\nThe erosion of the traditional family structure and marriage has been in the works long before the 1900s, it has been at work since the mid 1800s. All at the start of the mid 1800s with feminism and compulsory education, do you think it's all coincidence they all started between 1848 and 1852? Do you think it's a fucking coincidence these movements recieved shitloads of funding and legal support from either wealthy bankers or the governmental institutions themselves?\n\nIn case you don't believe me in concerns to compulsory education\n\nhttp://mhla.org/information/massdocuments/mglhistory.htm\n\nYeah. \n\nIn fact it is also no fucking coincidence that such a kiked out institution allowed for, and arguably even PUSHED FOR the feminization of universalized education as well\n\nhttps://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena.mit.edu/org/w/wgs/prize/eb04.html\nA tl;dr of the kiking is\n>make compulsory education mandatory\n>poor cities/towns can't afford a well trained male teacher\n>poor cities/towns instead hire mediocre to shit trained female teachers\n>said female teachers become the norm as does subpar education\n\nHere's my additional input that you won't find in the article\n>said subpar education eventually becomes poisoned by feminist doctrine since most working women will not be traditional women but instead the meme of \"career women\"\n\nIt is no coincidence that the role in which feminism and compulsory education has played at shaping modern societies since the turn of the 19th century was a crucial one. It is not something that should be shrugged aside and ignored, for as long as our educational institutions continue to be as feminized as they are today, so will the minds of our youth and intellectuals. This is why the government strongly opposes homeschooling, because it gives parents and their children agency to break free from the kiked out agenda they have.\n\nMind you I am not being some sort of MGTOW/MRA beta cuck blaming women for all of this. Hell most women actually voted against suffrage, universal education and even equal employment rights! However I cannot turn a blind eye to the crucial role they and their white knights had at destabilizing modern civilization.",

This is why laws such as the following exist\n\n>Although child marriage is not very common in the U.S., it is legal in almost every state. Nearly every state technically prohibits people younger than 18 from marrying, but each of these jurisdictions has exceptions to these laws. In at least 36 states, for example, minors can marry with judicial consent. And in 34 states, 16- and 17-year-olds can marry with their parents’ permission. Two states, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, allow 12- and 13-year-old girls respectively and 14-year-old boys to marry with parental and judicial permission. (Data on marriages among those under the age of 15 are not available from the American Community Survey.)\n\n>A handful of states allow minors to marry if one partner is pregnant or has recently given birth. For example, in Florida, judges may issue licenses without an age minimum if one of the parties to the marriage is pregnant.\n\nsource: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/01/child-marriage-is-rare-in-the-u-s-though-this-varies-by-state/\nhttps://archive.is/MxI5e\n\n>To be fair - we wiped out cultural education (mother-daughter) in favor of public education\n\nI thought my post above was clear enough, but it was obviously not. It wasn't just culture that was killed with the mass standardization of education. As I pointed out in my post and even sourced it (slightly) in my post, the educational standards were also lowered due to the fact that women were cheaper to hire due to receiving lesser training.  Something I did forget to mention however in addition to all this, is the fact that the study for trades was also killed by this.\n\nBy making education compulsory we in essence not just lowered the standards, but also pluralized the fields of knowledge. This continual watering down, instead of specialization into a specific field, trade or just vocation and so forth is what eventually led to the centralization of the education system.\n\n>From my own personal standpoint - there's something disturbing about the concept of \"training\" a wife.\n\nThat's because you have not let go of the social programming this feminist society has ingrained into you. The fact is that women were bred and created for one sole thing, give us babies, maintain the home, and every once in a while offer input in concerns to house or social affairs. You need to let go of this retarded meme of intellectual and social equality, because biology and even social sciences show this is not the case.\n\n>However, now, they are kind of like \"Eh... I kind of feel like settling down and starting a family.\"\n\nThat's their biological clock speaking, and no it's not just a shitty MGTOW/MRA/Incel meme, it's a real reality your modern western roasty does not want to admit until it's too late and she's hitting her 30s or sometimes even late 30s.\n\nlinks and photo are related \n\nhttps://extendfertility.com/your-fertility-3/fertility-and-age/\nhttps://archive.is/Gjkoc\nhttps://www.fertilityassociates.co.nz/understanding-your-fertility/biological-clock\nhttps://archive.is/dfhSp\nhttps://uscfertility.org/womans-biological-clock-fertility/\nhttps://archive.is/ypfaD\n\nThis is the danger of speaking about a topic using pure anecdotal evidence instead of facts.",

Basically in essence the OP wants to inject into his stem cells specific genes that will be able to code for specific SNPs. Now contrary to popular belief, stem cells aren't as all mighty, nor as rare as you would think. No, in fact all humans and mammals have stem cells, what makes ADULT STEMCELLS and EMBRYONIC STEMCELLS so different is the differentiation and amount of differentiated cellular structures around them. Differentiation, for the uninitiated, is basically the level of plasticity and specialization a cell has gone through. \n\nNow I'm not a doctor and I'm also a lazy faggot who's busy anyhow, so this part of mammalian biology I'm going to skim over; Basically all cells in your body, whether that's muscle cells, neurons, RBCs etc. etc. all start off as stemcells. Through genetic regulation at the transcriptional level, stemcells begin their specialization to rebuild and maintain specific parts of the body for the rest of an organism's life. \n\nThe reason why OP's virus would not be able to wreck complete havoc in our ecosystem is because as is all of our cells with means of self replication already have random mutations however gene regulation due to cellular differentiation \"keeps them in check\" so to speak.These mutations are called long interspersed nuclear elements or LINEs for short. These LINEs are not always expressed for the most part, despite them having the ability of retrotranscriptase replication. This is DESPITE these random mutations occurring in approximately like 20%+~ of the Human genome!\n\n>b-b-b-but what if the virus mutates!\n\nThe faggot OP hopefully is smart enough NOT TO use an unstable, error prone, retrovirus then.",

These guys are even more useless since they can't self replicate at all and depend on LINEs for replication as well. While LINEs have been theorized to actually help from time to time with chromosomal flexibility as well as happy accidents where a mutation ends up being beneficial to the host organism, SINEs haven't really. In fact SINEs have even been theorized to be some sort of parasitic genetic meme, that just exists to replicate itself in a very conservative manner. They're so rigid and cumbersome they've been, yet again, theorized to hinder molecular processes.\n\nIn general SINEs' exact nature and purpose is still a big mystery, however their presence has been greatly catalogued in mammals, in fact the presence of certain SINEs can sometimes help spot genetic borne diseases or syndromes in an individual.",
