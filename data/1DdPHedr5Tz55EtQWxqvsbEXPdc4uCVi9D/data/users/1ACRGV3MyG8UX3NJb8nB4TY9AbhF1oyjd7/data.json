Zeronet has three mode in regards to Tor: disabled, enabled and always\n'enabled' is the default and will allow connections for bother normal p2p and p2p over onion traffic.\nThe exception is just so that the domain(likely 127.0.0.1(localhost) for most here) will not be routed throug Tor, since you want to connect to your zeronet client and not some Tor exit node you happen to get out of.\nYou should use the Tob Browser to prevent the js on sites you  visit to find/leak your IP.
