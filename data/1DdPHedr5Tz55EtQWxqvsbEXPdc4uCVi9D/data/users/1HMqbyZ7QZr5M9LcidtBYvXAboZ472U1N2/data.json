Of course if you seed everything it's basically impossible as you have to look through over 40000 files. When searching I found lots of CP, although I think I'm pretty clean now I just don't know.

You might argue that it's worse than canned food for example, but that still doesn't make it useless. Since even when talking specifically about gold he still doesn't say that it lost all it's value later on and on top of that says outright that it was useful I'm just going to trust this guy.\nIf I were to experience a situation like this I'd probably sell all my gold right at the beginning too (not that I have any), but later on you require something to trade with. There's a reason (nearly?) all societies used gold for trading/as a currency, and I doubt that that reason would just disappear in a newly formed society after a collapse.",
