They are just gathering random IPs of other journalists at this point.\nThanks for patricipating and helping to distribute i guess.\nAnd why the fuck am i not on that map, even thought that i knowingly run it without Tor for a day to sync stuff faster?\n\nWhy are they so scared about it? Is this the first time that they hear about P2P? Peer-to-Peer filesharing like BitTorrent made up >40% of all internet traffic in 2009. \nAnd they also did run around with that boogeyman that peers see IPs of each other. \n\nWelcome to the internet outside of Twitter and Facebook, journalists!",
