It'd be a lot of work to block all of the Q-cultists, so I'd just block them when you happen to run into them. Blacklisting someone will also delete any content by them on your PC too. I believe this isn't just limited to specific sites either, but across the entirety of ZeroNet itself.",

This seems to be a common issue with tor, which would maybe suggest that your seeding issue may be due to tor (I'm a newfag at this stuff so I could be wrong).",

Thumbnail images get downloaded and seeded automatically, if you click an image it too will download and seed, and I don't think you can disable that, unless there was some option to disable thumbnails/images from loading. A load on request option would probably be nice for thumbnails/images/videos.",
