There are still about 80 I don't have and therefore can't propagate.  There doesn't seem to be any prioritization in an update or check files process.  If you stuck on 2510 for example, you won't get more until you get past that.  Only way I found was to keep hammering the update and check file processes.

I have a mind, and can form my own opinions.\n\nWhen I look at all of the time and shekels which have gone into the holohoax production and maintaining of the brainwashing worldwide, I come to the conclusion that it's not something jews would ever permit being supplanted.  Displace their victim status and the whole facade begins to crumble.  Any order of magnitude above muh six million, in actual deaths, would do this.

This is a five year summary of the case, and represent the latest example of stalling.  As it's an agreement between both parties, Preska was relatively quick to approve on April 14th.\n\nThis rendering of protocol was found necessary since it was previously determined that only motions decided by former Judge Sweet and those relevant documents qualified for public access.  Since Preska replaced Sweet, there have been too many additional documents presented which would otherwise not be classified as \"sealed\".",
