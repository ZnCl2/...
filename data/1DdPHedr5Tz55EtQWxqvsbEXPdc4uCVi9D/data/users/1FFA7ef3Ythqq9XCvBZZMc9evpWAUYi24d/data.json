Basically seems like there are users who might be lost in the void talking to themselves because they haven't switched to a ZeroID certificate and old content from before the switch is either lost or needs to be seeded again. This is what I've gathered just by lurking the different boards, someone who knows more about what the issue is can correct me if I'm wrong.",

One of the first ones I could picture would be offering flexibility in how to handle the [M] function. Just because I want to remove someone's posts when they start shitting up a single thread doesn't mean I want them banished from the website on my end.\n\n>If we can get this working well, and retain an userbase, then we have a small barrier of entry that will keep a portion of people who shouldn't be here anyway out while simultaneously aiding with the stability of this place and being more resilient to being taken down.\nPotential is almost the only thing this place has at the moment. The spam from last night coupled with the technical issues from switching from user generated certificates to certificates generated by ZeroID show this place has a way to go before it becomes an acceptable alternative to 8chan.\n\n\n>>9e7c1d88-6996-4265-af7e-c7b1e87bd18f\n>>64a87945-ff42-47db-acae-d21fc147e139\n>>6cd1c674-2cef-476e-a523-c50f68c363dc\nshit nigger what are you doing",

The links are made at least, that's how I was able to at least bring some of those images back; I took what images I uploaded and copied them into the src folder in the user data folder, then renamed them to what the file shows up in the link, and started the seed. It was a pain in the ass, but it worked. I'll have to do that for the pics I uploaded here and from now on once I get back.\n\n>>d21baf0f-0224-40e1-bd41-a788785df736\n>despair.jpg\nyes",

Any image that loads on your browser while you're on a board you've pinned will be downloaded and start seeding. This means files inside threads you don't visit **aside from the OP image which you'll always see whether or not you use the catalog** and files that are hidden that you don't expand won't be downloaded and seeded by you.",

In particular, smaller boards that had a few dedicated anons almost all died. The only boards getting more than 5+ posts a day now are /pol/, /v/, /qresearch/, /tech/, /b/, and /test/. There's a dedicated little group of autists trying to make this place work. I've had forced anonymity on the past few days since the millchan update, but I imagine if I didn't I'd see the same few names pop up many times. \n\nThe only way 08chan picks up in traffic in the near future are if 8chan goes down for good, is DDoS'd to shit for a week, or if it staying up is done so in a way that spooks anon. 8chan's days are numbered even if none of these things happen though, so in the long term I can see anons coming here en masse once that happens. I believe most of the technical issues should be fixed by then, so we won't have another issue that kills the zite like the last one did.\n\nOne thing that could be done to increase traffic making some easily digestible guides on how to set up ZN/how the zite works/how 2 into l33t h4ck3r opsec by using Tor properly that can be posted in other bunkers when someone asks how to use 08chan **I'll post what I have**. Another is visiting the smaller boards and posting content so they don't wither and die because of lack of activity. That's only if you care about keeping any of the non-legacy boards active, though. Long term I think there is sustainability, we'll just have to see if 08chan stays active for that long.",

(90% of the size art right there)\nLetting your peepee guide you into creating things can be a good thing though. Look how Yoko Taro wanting gaming's greatest ass turned into Near Atomato, or how MGQ/Sengoku Rance/Kamidori Alchemy Meister is better than 99% of games put out by multinational corporate enterprises, or how you can almost judge the quality of a game by how much and how proudly it presents tits and ass. Modern gaming is shit partly because it tries to sterilize itself, and then you have tumblrtards who can't into games/art because their psyche is at war with itself and human desires. Though the inverse can be worse, where you have autists who go in too deep and start making songs about how much they want their pokemon wife to shit in their mouth. The point is fetish fuel can be a force for good.\n\n>What about how they could fit into places nobody else could, or how they could ride things nobody else could?\nSome of the most memorable games I've played are the ones where you're smol in a big world, Toy Commander, Katamari Damacy, Pikmin. **I think a game where you're tiny but had the mobility of something like BotW would be GOAT. Gliding from room to room using currents from AC vents, whittling down matchsticks to use as torches at night when the lights go off, horror sections inside the walls as you try not to get eaten by house centipedes and spiders.**\n\n>Birds are fucking awesome for this because they're beautiful and can fly\nTrue.\n\n>Fucking nobody mentions that stuff.\nMost people can't even entertain their own imagination, they're not going to be able to peek into someone else's and come away with anything interesting going on in their head.",

What went wrong?\n>RANDOMLY GENERATED Metroidvania\nuh oh\n\n>three areas are composed of boxes of possible rooms, with all the rooms inside these boxes being randomly generated\n>instead of well crafted combat scenarios, every fight in these randomly generated rooms, aside from the boss battles which take place in special rooms, are a complete clusterfuck that descend into button mashing till you get your finisher charged so you can not drown in enemies\n>because every fight is a clusterfuck, enemies are reduced to usually only having 1 or two moves they can perform, with reskins of enemies only having an improved version of that attack and more health\n>enemies that use ranged attacks can fire through terrain, likely because otherwise they would be completely ineffective because of the cramped rooms and lacking enemy AI\n>some rooms are filled with randomly distributed traps just to slather more action onto an already busy screen\n>even if combat was better, exploration becomes a hassle, the three areas you explore are distinct from each other but become bland once you've been through each one more than once, and YOU WILL go through them more than once\n\nDevs looked at the abomination they created and instead of reeling it back in and refining combat or axing a core component of the game, they chose to buff the player to compensate\n>first upgrade you'll find is a shield that regenerates only a few seconds after taking damage\n>dash you can spam with very generous i-frames\n>another bar to represent health\n>ANOTHER BAR to represent health packs you can use\n>all these can be buffed even more through upgrade tree, and perks you can equip\n>EVEN IF YOU DIE, there is no penalty for death\n\nEssentially I see what could have been a decent game ruined by one feature. Randomly generated rooms ruins the combat, which ruins the game play flow, which ruins the whole game.\n\nOther less important things that made the whole experience a little more sour.\n>FUCKHUEG bosses are limited in a similar way to regular enemies, for whatever reason their patterns are BORINGLY simple, there is a lack of push-and-pull in combat, it's either you waiting for an opening or mindlessly spamming the boss **only exception was Chair McFisty, only enjoyable boss fight**\n>your combat moveset is just as shallow as the enemies, no parry/counter/combo system, and the combat moveset you have at the end of the game is almost exactly the same as you have at the beginning, the only difference is damage buffs, size/amount of charges of finishers, and the new ability to charge attacks for damage that is useless since button spam is always more effective\n>map labels what rooms are gated from progress but not if you have the appropriate item to pass, meaning you'll have to run through the same repeating rooms and deal with more mindless combat to see if you're new ability will let you pass through an area\n>music was meh\n>not using the shards gives you a few more slots on upgrade tree and 2 worst endings\n\nHOWEVER\n>some minibosses were actually fun to fight\n>shard upgraded abilities almost all upgrade mobility, meaning you can go pretty fast and go places you aren't supposed to\n>few areas that weren't just mished-mashed together through RNG looked nice\n>some challenge areas that were hidden gave you permanent boosts and were fun\n>**not!Nyarlathotep Hitler turning you into a pure-aryan-super-demon to declare anschluss on the surface was neat**\n\nWouldn't have beaten it, but I have autism about such things and don't like putting something down unless I've completed",
