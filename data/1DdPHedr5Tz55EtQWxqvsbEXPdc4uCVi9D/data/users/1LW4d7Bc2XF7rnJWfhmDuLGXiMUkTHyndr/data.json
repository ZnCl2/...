I switched from VPN to Tor and started seeding and in under a minute can now see the full resolution on all but the first three images in this post >>00b5bba9-7933-4740-838a-d1596c0a4c9a and am seeding. I'm guessing that ZeroNet is picky about who is seeding what on Tor. Not much of a problem on larger boards, but for smaller boards it's a pain.\n\n>EDIT: Will come back tomorrow, need to get to work.\nDamn it, anon comes here to relax, not troubleshoot!\n\nAnd now I'm only connected to one peer while on Tor. Interesting. It seems VPNs are the way to go until the image issue gets sorted out.",

Any images you post on ZeroNet are linked to your identity address **you can find someone's IA by clicking the mute button on their post** which can be found in your ZeroNet folder. data.json contains the text of every post you've made while using that IA, and src contains every image you've posted while using that IA. There are ways to generate a new IA while keeping your blacklist of users/boards though, and unless you post personal information you're as safe from being doxed as if you were posting on 8chan. At most you can find out if the anon you're replying to visits /abdl/.\n\nUltimately though, that's not the issue of using ZeroNet. It's accidentally hosting illegal content. I'd use a VPN or Tor if you're trying to seed the site, and either running a VM or deleting the ZeroNet folder after you're done using the site if you just want to shitpost without seeding.",

			"body": "==NOW WITH LESS HALFCHAN AND REDDITOR ENCOUNTERS==\nWe’re creating a video game in RPG Maker VX Ace together with other anons.\nHere’s how it works.\nEveryone is taking turns downloading the newest version of the game, making contributions before reuploading it for someone else to work on it. Only one person can actively work on it at a time. This is because if two people make overlapping changes to the database, scripts or switches, they will conflict resulting in one person having to redo all their work. Changes to the map and events can be copy-pasted from one version of a project to another so you’re free to work on new maps and new events if its not your turn and add them to the current version of the game once it is your turn.\nIt should work like this. OP posts newest version of the map. The first person (Anon #1) to respond to OP stating that he’s going to work on it becomes the active game dev. Once Anon #1 finishes and re-uploads it, the first person to respond to him gets to work on it. So on and so forth. Additionally, whenever you re-upload a new version, reply to the anchor post, it’ll make things a lot easier.\n==GENERAL RULES==\n>Don’t mess with maps, events or anything else you didn’t make. Although, adding minor stuff like a connection between two areas or fixing bugs and typos is all fine. \n>If you’re ok with others editing your stuff, leave a note saying so.\n>You’re free to add characters and the like, to the inter-dimensional tavern.\n>You’re also free to make changes to game settings, unless its something we’ve agreed upon (we’ll probably do this via a poll)\n>We also have a dedicated board now >>>/bizarre/ come post and check it out! (The exact way we use, and the general purpose of the board in relation to the threads on /v/ will probably change change over time. However there will always be threads maintained on /v/, regardless of what happens on the board.)\n\n==FAQ==\n==How do I RPG Maker VX Ace?==\n>Here’s a good tutorial series if you want to learn how to use it. inb4 jewtube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzqt1PzBxxQ&list=PLzevVXwTX9wipsdJnTsuzUoCLb9v5npat\n==What about RPG Maker MV?==\n>We decided in the last thread that we’re using VX Ace. We’re not changing this again. Get it out of your head right now. If you made content in MV you’ll have to back port it to VX Ace. It sucks, but we’re not doing any more engine changes.\n==Why don't you fucks use version control?==\n>Like RPG Maker MV, we tried that and the project died. Nobody wanted to learn git. It can't be helped. Plus someone needs a (((premium))) account if we want the project to be private.\n==Are you guys affiliated with [PUT ANY OTHER /v/ PROJECT HERE]==\n>No, the group creating this game is not a stable dev group and is only comprised of random anons who get interested in the project enough to start developing is.\n==Add X to the Game!==\n>Suggestions are fine, but if you want something added to the game. DO IT YOURSELF. Its not that hard.\n==What should I add?==\n>Go nuts, add whatever the hell you like! (However, please keep in mind that if the filesize of this project gets too large it’ll become unruly to work with. So please be somewhat conservative when adding large music or .ogv files.)\n==Is OP a faggot?==\n>Yes\n\n==Current version of the game (0.525 Dimensional Tear Patch)==\nhttps://mega.nz/#!mwkjQQbL!-bkoHzBmjsQfKTwO4d1kDmvw7GO3KYY_gi0VzVsZgrI\n==RPG Maker VX ACE magnet: This one contains all the DLC==\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:76UC6DG7T6T7SYYLGZQ3AER5OWV6KTF3&dn=RPG+Maker+VX+ACE+%2B+All+Resource+Packs+%28Ultimate+Edition%29&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fnyaa.tracker.wf%3A7777%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.stealth.si%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969%2Fannounce\n==Sprites and stuff: Feel free to steal==\nhttps://rpg-maker-artists.deviantart.com/gallery/25208345/RPG-Maker-Sprites\n==You can also steal more shit from the XV Ace steam workshop using this==\nhttp://steamworkshopdownloader.com/\n==Archive of Previous==",

			"body": "After playing Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and Xenoblade X, I wanted to go back and play the rest of the Xeno games. I started playing Xenogears and so far it seems quite interesting. Particularly I really dig the aesthetics, the combo system and the world building. The soundtrack is pretty good too. Combat seems a bit on the simple side, at least compared to Xenoblade, but it may just be that the game seems to have a \"slow\". I'm just after rescuing Marge, so I think it is too early still to judge the combat system. How does this game compares to Xenosaga and Xenoblade? How good/bad the combat system is? Is the writing good (despite being pretty much unfinished from what I heard)?\n\nAlso, looking forward to play also Xenosaga. How do they fare? I heard they had some development problems as well and later chapters suffer from it. How is Xenoblade 2? Opinions seem quite split for what I heard. Particularly, its the gameplay good compared to the other two games?",

It's the kind of JRPG that has literal 20 minute long cutscenes and throws a metric fuckton of made-up terms and words at you. It was unique and extremely neat but dragged like nobody's business and I never ended up finishing it **which I deeply regret**. I never played Xenosaga 2 out of shame as a result.\n\nXenoblade Chronicles 2 is great and I love it. The characters are interesting, the combat is pretty not bad, and it's got that Xeno* quality where you slowly develop your character however you want and end up with a result that's pretty unique. It's got a lot of problems, not the least of which is the gachashit Blade drawing system, but I wholeheartedly recommend it anyway **Zeke is best character and Pandoria a cute**",

X has to be one of the most satisfying modern open world RPGs right now, with a good combat system, with a lot of content and a world that is actually interesting to explore (specially when you find some of the hidden bosses and shit your pant's at the size of them). It just that the story was unfinished and clearly the game needed more work. I blame the multiplayer component for fucking with the development of the game. If at least you could roam the world in Coop it may have been cool, but the pseudo multiplayer elements and the coop missions were lame. I also would had liked more aliens as party members, seeing as the story focused so much in learning to live in a new planet and cohabit with other civilizations.\n\nFinally, a little pit peeve of mine, but I wish we could allocate more skills on our \"hotbars\" so to speak, kind of like Sulk's Monado's Artes, the player have a set of Melee Skills and Ranged skills, and changing weapons mid fight would bring one or the other.",

For my part, MNK's changes in 5.05 were good, but some of them may be a bit strong (Riddle of the Earth) while leaving SSS, Tornado Kick and Anatma practically useless, as now keeping your stacks is way easier. I'll say turning them into regular oGCD skills may be the solution, but I'll prefer if they had further function beside damage, even if it is not related to GL, but can't think of anything good. SMN is great for me, but is getting a lot of hate, I fear big changes are on the way. For my part, I'll like if SE fucking fixed the pet's AIs already so Bahamuth and Phoenix prioritize attacking before moving so we stop losing so much DPS. Also wouldn't mind if Ruin II was a bit stronger and the timing of Tri-disaster wasn't as awkward, it feels pretty bad to enter trance when Tri is like less than 15 seconds away from coming out of cooldown, or having to manually apply DoTs when there are less than 10 seconds for Wyrm Trance. For SCH, I wish they gave us back some more skills. At this point I have given up in them coming with interesting downtime for SCH, so at least SB damage rotation should do.\n\nEdit: oh, also, would like if SMN's potencies were increased. Their damage feels too low for what is supposed to be a core element of the class. Egi Action being only Ruin IV generators bothers me, I like the interaction between Egi and summoner, but I'll like them being more important. Also wouldn't mind them being turned into Demi with a buff to their attacks, but that is too much to ask.",

I've been seeding overnight on a VPN without Tor but if I remember correctly your connection can be set to where you're only making connections to peers using Tor. The spammer really fucked /v/, /pol/ and /qresearch/, so it also might have to do with the Zeroid solution that BO was forced to use to counter the spam. I'd wait until more people are awake and start trying to fix the problem before giving up on 08chan, I doubt you're going to be the only one with this problem.\n\nThese are the subject lines of most of the threads I remade\n>Drawthread\n>Deus Ex\n>Post porn\n>TOUHOU THREAD GRAZING THE 8CH SERVER EXPLOSION EDITION\n>Amateur Game Development General & Vidya Modding - /agdg/ + /vm/\n>/v/ writes a letter to the House Homeland Security Committee\n>Anon's bizarre vidya adventure AKA /v/ makes an RPG maker game: (New game plus edition) #013\n>Xeno games discussion\n>Vermintide 2\n>/gbfg/ refugee thread\n>/gsg/ thread\n>FFXIV General- A New Beginning Edition\n\nAre any of these loading for you?",
