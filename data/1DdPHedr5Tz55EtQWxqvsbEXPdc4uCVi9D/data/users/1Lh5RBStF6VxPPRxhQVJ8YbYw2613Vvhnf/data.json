			"body": "I used to post about my project on 8ch.net, but you know how that goes. Now I've got Zeronet, TOR, and veracrypt running just to shitpost about nodev. Fuck.\n\nAnyway. The Last Boundary is a game about exploring a new quadrant of space that has just opened up due to the invention of new kind of spaceship engine. The game is presented as a Choose Your Own Adventure type of game, from the viewpoint of the Captain of the starship.\n\nThe big influence of the game is Star Trek, particularly The Next Generation, but I think it's probably more like the original series. The idea is that all other Star Trek games are pew-pew lasers and, aside from the reboot universe of faggotry, that's not really what Star Trek is about. So instead, a Choose Your Own Adventure style seemed to me like it would suit Star Trek.\n\nThe graphics a pixel-graphics, but I've added some neato special effects where needed. I've also authored a tool which you use to write the game stories, that I would release alongside the game so people can make their own adventures, though I have no doubt that absolutely zero people would do that.\n\nRight now, I think the game mechanics is like 95% complete. You can play through adventures and it's as fun as my writing is good. I still need to do a little bit more about giving the player more feedback during the system selection screen (your starmap), mostly to give something between missions. I haven't quite figured out what to do, but my thinking is the player may direct the U.E.E. forces on where to setup shop in the new quadrant as the player explores. (U.E.E is the United Earth Empire).\n\nHere's some screenshots and shit. I'll post here every time I update something meaningful. I have the same devblog at TIGSource, Itch.io, and the games website at thelastboundary.com but nodev is where I'm from so this will always be my favourite place to blog.",

			"body": "Ages ago, whilst browsing clearnet 8ch, I kept coming across S.T.A.L.K.E.R. threads. I had of course heard of the game, but I'd never played it. I found I had some time, so pirated it onto my laptop toaster (which is a Surface Pro, don't knock it, it's a super-handy piece of toast), and downloaded some shit to run it with x-box controller and some performance graphics mods.\n\nSome of my best experiences were in this game, just going along the zone, looking around. Getting shit scared at night, and hanging out by campfires.\n\nI have nothing to add to this thread except a recommendation that if someone here, somehow, was like me and hadn't bothered to play this game, get it. It's comfy.",
