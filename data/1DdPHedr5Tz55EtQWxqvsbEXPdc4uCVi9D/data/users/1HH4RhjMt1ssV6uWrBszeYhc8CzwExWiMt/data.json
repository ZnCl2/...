It's serviceable, but I don't think I'd have gotten into tabletop if this was my initial experience. It feels... hollow. Maybe I'm just autistic.

			"body": "Well, our party's tank couldn't make it to the session, so my two players started out in the middle of the woods, having followed a shapeshifter into the woods after it burned a holy man alive while he slept in the town's temple.\n\nIt wound up being a big fuzzy fox that cast illusions, and it had a partner that surprised the party and nearly wiped them out with a lucky crit. They beat one of them, but its partner used its illusions to hide its unconscious form and bail with it. That was last time, THIS time we open with 2 players at half HP and some moderate injuries, and they've completely forgotten that fact as they pull out all the stops to find where the foxes went.\n\nThey heard a howl, and suddenly a bunch of giant centipedes and spiders show up from the darkness and nearly wipe them both out. Meanwhile, the party chef's pet cockatrice was sniffing out where the foxes went, and found them... they then spent the next 60 seconds missing attacks on one another until our doctor's pet dog went over and fired a hadouken at it, killing the fox instantly.\n\nLong story short, they went back to town and the guy who hired them to guard the town that night was ultra pissed because the guy who died was a friend of his, so he refused to pay them and threatened them a bit, just to be a dick. They felt a bit bad about it, so they had a statue commissioned for the guy, since everyone in town seemed to like him. They stuck around for a bit and tried to learn about the dead guy.\n\n**Some other stuff happened too, like people rioting at the adventurer's guild, but that's less interesting.**",

I did a Reverse Recruitment run of FE6, which was interesting at first, but got a bit tiring towards the end because FE6 is a tiring game.\nSo now I'm playing the Sacred Trilogy romhack for FE8, which has changed enough of the game to make it quite fresh. I accidentally unlocked true ultimate power: when Ewan the Summoner hit level 20, his phantoms became invincible. They'd hit 0 HP, die, but not be removed from the map. I found this out in the Tower of Valni, where the summon would level Ewan up every single time it \"died\". So, he wound up being level 43, nearly having every stat maxed out in about half an hour. Another important thing is that the game also adds skills to FE8, which can be quite... interesting with some characters.",
