But when they are stored on disk, they'll be stored with their hash as a filename, so they won't be stored as an actually valid .json. Unless there's a field to specify that they'll be stored by name and not by hash.\nAnd in any case, they won't be sent in the first place, because the clients will reject them because they don't come from a client with a valid certificate (kind of a catch-22 situation there).",

All the old IDs were generated with public/private key pairs randomly generated by the users themselves.\nSo even if you set up a (centralized) service to sign people's IDs as valid for posting (which is basically what ZeroID does) then that system won't have anything to do with the old self-signed certs, and those will keep being invalid.

Now let's hope that change doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.\nMy previous analysis was wrong probably because the files are hashed by the js frontend, but when they are in storage already they're copied as-is. But I don't understand why they are being accepted by other machines without a valid ZeroID certificate. Maybe ZeroNet is smart enough to know if the file to be copied '''is''' the content.json, then it can read the same content.json to determine permissions, possibly before it even exists locally?\nThis probably opens up a vulnerability, though. Anyone should be able to generate self-signed IDs, put them there on the disk, and other anons will fetch them from him. I don't understand why straight up posting without ZeroID doesn't work. Maybe it goes through another separate mechanism that still performs permission checking. Or maybe your changes didn't propagate enough for me to post without ZID.",
