Whatever was supposed to come of the general movement that progressed from the aftermath of the First World War to the communication forums spawned by the saturation of internet technology, it has completely failed in doing anything about the jewish infestation of the West. Moreover, it has in many ways allowed itself to be duped over and over again by the most extreme representations of the judaic power structure with nothing more than empty gestures.\n\nIt is this judaic power structure that is attacking China through the post-imperial Hong Kong vector. If you want to attach yourself to that, feel free. Just don't expect anyone else to join you.",

That's why China leans so heavily on its corporate espionage program -- it's really cheap in the long run.\n\nNothing exposes the jewish-blooded fakes in our circles like productive autarky and the rigid adherence to it as a governing ideal. They always want to talk about the external, never the internal. They always have some reason or argument for why productive capacity doesn't matter -- because for them it doesn't. They are jewish capitalists who don't want production back in America because it would give resources and technical knowledge to domestic enemies [White people who want a better life than they've got currently].

What you're describing only grants an extension onto the parasitical jewish presence -- in fact, it is precisely the avenue jews want to take it. That's why Trump is in the White House in the first place.\n\nAnd his administration's results have been plain as day: everything for israel, nothing but hamfisted and half-hearted tweets for White Americans that don't achieve anything but an increasingly hostile climate where regular White people -- the kind Trump and his jewish handlers believe they have a divine right to shove in trenches and command with whistles -- take the brunt of it.\n\nTrump has no solutions to core problems facing the West. He literally can't produce a solution because the number one goal is the retention and salvaging of the israeli project and the postwar jewish control of the United States as israel's colonial meatshield. We in the West, and in Russia to a lesser extent, are still dealing with the legacy of the fratricidal apocalypse of WWI, this jew-instigated and jew-run \"civil war\" that has never really ended.
