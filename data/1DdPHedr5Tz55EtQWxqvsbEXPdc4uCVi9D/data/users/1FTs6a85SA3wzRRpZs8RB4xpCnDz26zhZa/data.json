So why do so many apologize for them? Where does this need to explain come from? Or the need to even excuse it?\n\nThere never was any need to vilify those who thought differently - only resolutely oppose them. \"Not in our interests\".\n\nBlacks, deviants, social justice warriors, and communists deserve their own space to build their \"shining example\" for the world.\n\nBut they don't deserve even the slightest attention when telling us how WE wish to live.\n\nIt's very difficult to change minds. So, can we get off this treadmill? By respecting boundaries.\n\nSpotted an article just this week. That CO baker is in trouble again for refusing to serve an alphabet. How is this possible?\n\nWhat is the simplest signal one can send for \"leave me alone\"?",

Their Trump hatred was just one aspect of their zeal to serve the inner party.\nGovernment will always be corrupt, as men are not angels. Whether it is the lust for power or the temptations that come with power, corruption is part of the human condition. A much more serious problem is a government overrun by fanatical ideologues. That may be the heart of this scandal. The long march through the institutions has been followed by a radicalization of the institutions. The inner party now operates like a religious cult, rather than a political operation.",
