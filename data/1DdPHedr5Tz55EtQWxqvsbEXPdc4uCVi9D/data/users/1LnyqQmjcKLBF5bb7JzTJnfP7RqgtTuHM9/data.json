Inside the package there is another locked package which hes got no key for and which holds an address. So he sends this locked package to the second hop. Rinse/repeat 3rd locked package goes to the exit node. The Exit node can only see a locked package coming from the middle node. Unwraps package and is sending the package to the clearnet address. So 3 is just enough that entry and exit dont know each other. So I theory it's safe. Unless all 3 are hosted by the same NGO at Hetzner Datacenter, kek. \nThe good news is, for onion to onion, its another chain of 3 hops on the other end (unless it's one of those new fast hidden services. If you want really long chains with like 5 or 7 hops each side, then you need to look into i2p. But zeronet isn't supporting it (yet?). \nThere is that  common misconception - zeronet is, by itself, and never was, about privacy. Zeronet is about not being easily deplatformed by Mr. I-control-the-interwebs. So it has pretty much been made for 8chans situation. Because that is exactly what it does. Prevent Cloudflare Fuckers & friends to easily shut you down. It does _not_ take care of anonymity or privacy (tor has been tacked on later because people kept asking for the feature). ",

Site owner just needs to limit new registrations. A Board could run its own id service with captcha, buddy invites ... plus zeronet nodes can run as hidden services. That means a good chunk of the DoS is going to hit the tor nodes in front of you. While it's pretty simple to DoS a single onion service, it's  a completely different story to take down an ever changing swarm of torrents. If I wanted to attack 0net, I would go for the trackers. I think thats the weakest point.",
