(Only up to level 35) - http://www.ffxiv-freetrial.com/us/\n     \n==Current Patch: 5.05==\n    Patch Archives -  http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/patchnote_log/\n     \n==Useful resources:==\n    List of Commands (used for macros) - http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/win/text_command/\n    Gamer Escape - http://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/\n    Garland Tools Database - http://www.garlandtools.org/db/\n    FF logs - http://www.fflogs.com/\n    ACT (but don't tell anyone you're using it) - http://advancedcombattracker.com/\n    FFXIV Guild (Leveling guides) - https://www.ffxivguild.com/\n    Teamcraft (crafting lists, rotation simulator, gathering alarms, etc.) - https://ffxivteamcraft.com/search\n    Ariyala (gear build simulator, hunt tracker, relic light tracker) - http://ffxiv.ariyala.com/\n     \n>Don't know what to do pre-80?\n    1. If you're brand new, do Hall of the Novice. It's stupid and only teaches you common sense stuff, but you get a 30% exp boosting ring and free level 15 gear.\n    2. Do all of your Main Story Quests - REQUIRED TO GET TO HEAVENSWARD AREAS/JOBS, HEAVENSWARD STORY IS REQUIRED FOR STORMBLOOD, etc. **though Stormblood/Shadowbringers jobs do not require story, just level 50/60**\n    3. Do all of your class quests and get yourself a job - http://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Category:Jobs\n    4. Attune to Chocobo Porters, Aetherytes & Aether Currents ASAP - it will save you a lot of time & effort\n    5. Unlock your challenge log, gives great exp and some gil - http://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Rising_to_the_Challenge\n    6. Do your daily roulettes - all of them are great until 80, except guildhests, which is great until around 40-50\n    7. Level crafting & gathering - free dosh (Cross-class skills make investing in multiple/all crafters worth it.)\n    8. Hit Tab to [I seem to have misplaced my keyboard]\n    9. Utilize the world-visit function to visit any world (server) on your datacenter. You can buy (but not sell) from their marketboards.\n \n==Get a FC, they give bonuses as long as the people in charge aren't retards==\n==You cannot join a FC if you are currently on a free trial account==\n==There is a cross-world linkshell for all anons on Primal, which free trial accounts can join==\n**The two \"main\" 8ch FCs are Old Wheels Order [OwO] on Exodus, and Infinity [INF] on Lamia**\n \nShitpost about cats, GCD, ACT, and how **Emet-Selch did nothing wrong**.",

In SB a lot of the skills keyed into each other and made their sort of a process to it all but with ShB a lot of stuff are independent of each other and makes you have to watch a lot of different cooldowns for optimal dps.\n\nI'm not 80 yet with my character so I don't know how it pans out in endgame but I was disappointed over what the 70+ skills/traits you get as a SMN.\n\nPLD though seems pretty fine. In fact I'm surprised how decent the damage has been for it with atonement and holy circle.",
