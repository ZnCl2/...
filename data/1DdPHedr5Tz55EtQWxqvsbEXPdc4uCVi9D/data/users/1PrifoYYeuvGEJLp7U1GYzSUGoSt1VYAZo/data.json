Im not scaring anyone zeronet came out of nowhere and was always considered a joke shilled on 4chan. Im just being honest here.I have to warn you guys of this actually i feel responsible to say this. Link prefetching. Disable it. how? go to about:config and set everything to false. Except the one that says prefetching.disabled. set that to true. So i am not just a herky jerky kind of asshole i know the need for decentrilization and i am being honest when i say zeronet is the 9gag of privacy tools. I just found another flaw. What is prefetching. EVERY TIME YOU OPEN A PAGE. IF YOUR MOUSE HOVERS OVER A LINK THE BROWSER STARTS DOWNLOADING THE LINKED PAGE. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE FILES FROM POSTERS WE NEVER CLICKED ON.",

I did not use 8chan for 2 years i left 8chan with a few hundred anons to endchan. I came back for pizzagate stickies on /pol/ then that lead to Q. Now that 8chan is gone the logical step would be to move to the next chan which was my home chan of endchan. I am essentially just a little peeved that we have to go through all this when endchan is fine. That is my animosity. That is my problem. ",
