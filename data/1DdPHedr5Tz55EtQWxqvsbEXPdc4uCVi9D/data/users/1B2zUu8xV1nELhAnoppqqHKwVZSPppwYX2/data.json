			"body": "Hi there, first post and also long time lurker from clearnet \"times\". I saw that some people where trying to work in a IFPS-based imageboard downloader-p2psharing app, but it wasn't exactly like EX-EH, so my question is, is there anything in the works to port the EX-EH galleries format into a decentralized \"zite\" or alike?.\n\nI think is something to look foward in the future, and would be useful outside scan-ecchi world.\n\nThanks in advance!",

To get a list on non-windows you can use ZeroNet.py --help, or in windows you can use zeronetfolder\\lib\\zeronet.cmd --help (took me a while to figure that out)\n\nThe command you are looking for is \"open_browser = False\"\n\nYou may die in peace, but other would may like to know the answer never the less :)",

Why do you think it is not on the network?\n\nWell, I can't navigate to it, the console gives a websocket error and upload percentage shows NaN and doesn't draw the upload meter, pic related.\n\nAlso, seeded mb in the my uploads menu never goes up from 0.0MB, my guess is that what ZeroUp publishes to peers successfuly is the new hashed url to the file, so others can see it, but not the file itself at that time, or maybe it is a site bug.\n\nIn the future I will try that clone, so thank you again.",
