It's not people one day waking up, talking to others, and deciding to do something.\nThe yellow vest cause it the abusive taxation in automn 2018 in France. A couple months before the yellow vest movment, people were talking angrily about the government and the taxes in the streets. I've heard them. \nIn november (i think), new taxes regarding oil were voted. The people who are from the middle/low socio professional categories didn't have enough money to make ends meets. \nThus they spontaneously (with twitter and facebook), decided to go on the street, and block highways and roundabouts. The first days were very effective. Probably more than a million active yellow vest, from all age, mostly in the provincial towns. At first, Paris didn't participate. Paris is mostly upper socio professional categories and immigrants. So they weren't concerned about the taxes. And the migrants don't care about class struggle at all. Class struggle is a white concern. So the first days/week were very tense. The yellow jackets weren't far from the Elysee Palace, were president Macron is. Macron send the police. About 80000 policemen were sent every yellow jacket demonstrations. The police were shooting the yellow jacket in the face with flashballs deliberately. About 23 yellow vest jackets' eyes were put out by flashballs. 3-4 hands were lost also, due to police teargas grenades.\nThe yellow vest movment was strong in november/december. Thousands of roundabouts everywhere in France were occupied. After the end of 2018 and christmas, the movement became a little less active. Then, the movement became less and less active. Macron never give the yellow vest anything. Participating to a yellow vest demonstration was risky. You could loose an eye or being gazed or beat up by the police. The police also took away many demonstrators. About 2000 were taken away and immediately condemened to substantial fines or even prison sentences. \nThere a video of a family mother taken away by the police, having spent the night in jail, being wake up during the night multiple time during the night by the police, being in a very small cell with other yellow vest arrested. Pressured to give away her smartphone. Police did do this not because the demonstrator were dangerous, but to put a lot of pressure on the movement, and scare them. In the end, it worked. Yellow vest were less and less many during the demonstration. \nThen, about around sprind, 2019, the movement was mostly composed of leftist organization, some far right organization, but it wasn't really the average people anymore. The movement in spring 2019 was about (if i remember correctly) about 40000 people. \nThe roundabouts, previously occupied by the yellow vests, were deserted around sprind 2019. \n\nNow, about the \"political\" view of the yellow vests, the answer is that at the begining, they didn't have any. They were against hierarchy, and a leader. Many people, like the leftist Juan Branco (probably controled opposition by the government/ deep state), tryed to impose themselves as the leader, but the yellow jackets always rejected them. Since the begining, there weren't a single \"leader\", which emerged. \nThe fact is at the begining, the movement was made of people who had difficulties to make end meets. Not fascists, like 4chan thinks, or leftists. There were racists people in the movement, but also some anti-racist lefties. The largest part of the movement didn't have any strong political tendency. Only that Macron was a son of a bitch. That every yellow jacket agreed on this. \nIn the end, it's dead now. But people never forgot what happened. French people were, at the begining of the movement, 80% in favor of it. Until the end, most french were in favor of the movement. Some retards were against, the red scarf movement, but it was a very small movement, composed of only a few thousand people, mostly upper socio professional categories from Paris. \nIn the end, i think the yellow vest movement is the movement which definitively discredited the french republic, and the french politic as a whole. The yellow vest wanted direct democracy, referendum based on poplar initiative. They got nothing. \nSo, IMO, the french political class is very weakened, as a whole. Included Marine Le Pen. The yellow vest were mistrustful of the whole policital class, from the far left to the far right. \nFor me, the yellow vest movement is the moment when the french people \"woke up\" about it's elites. We, on the internet, woke up 10, 15 years ago with the 9/11, . But for the average normie, it took more time. \nWe'll see what happen in the years to come. \n",

If the answer if yes, then yes, they are the solution. If the answer if no, then they are indeed NPC upper socio professional category.",
