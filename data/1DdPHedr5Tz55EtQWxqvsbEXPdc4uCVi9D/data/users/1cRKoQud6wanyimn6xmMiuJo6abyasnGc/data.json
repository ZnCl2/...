			"body": "I am (former) BO of 0/pone/. You're going to have to take my word for it. Though I was going to say that I hadn't deleted my cert, it turns out that I have, in fact, deleted it in my attempt to upgrade my version of ZeroNet from the one I got in 2017, since apparently downloading data via \"DOWNLOAD AND HELP DISTRIBUTE ALL FILES\" completely fucked my install, and being the nigger I am, I lacked the foresight to backup my users.json.\n\nOn the off chance that you haven't left: since some of this information is either no longer visible to new users or hasn't spread past the top few boards:\n\n==IMPORTANT: ZEROID==\nIf you don't know what ZeroID is, you likely aren't posting with one. Instead, you are posting with a self-signed certificate. Due to bots spamming various boards with self-signed certs, posting with self-signed certs is disabled. This means that anyone making a post with a self-signed cert will not have it seeded, i.e. nobody can see you post; nobody can hear you scream. Furthermore, posts and threads previously made with self-signed certs (as well as boards where all the posts were made with self-signed certificates) are NOT visible to new users.\n\n1. In order to post, you most register a ZeroID from the following site:\n>http://127.0.0.1:43110/1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/\nThis ID appears to be visible in the new UI (though there is an option to disable IDs), so keep that in mind. You will be locked to this ID after creating it, which is extremely gay.\n2. Once you have obtained a ZeroID, go to a 08chan page.\n3. Click and drag the top-right 0 logo to the left to reveal the menu. Go down to the field labeled \"IDENTITY ADDRESS\" and click the button labeled \"Change\". For the prompt at the top of your screen, select your new zeroid.bit address.\n4. Refresh the page.\n\n==IMPORTANT: \"PROCESSING POST... PLEASE WAIT\"==\nIf you are encountering this message whenever you try to post, you may need to update the 08chan code. \n\nED: Apparently the site has been updated; you should not encounter this problem anymore and the fix should not be necessary.\n\nThis is a temporary solution; the code is allegedly outdated. ~~It appears to have been hosted on gitgud.io, which appears to be down as of this posting.~~\n\n1. Go to an 08chan page.\n2. Drag the top-right 0 logo to the left.\n3. Go down to the slider labeled \"This is my site\" and click it. This will disable updates of site core files.\n~~4. Download the .mp4 file attached. (.zip files appear to be invisible to new users).~~\n~~5. Rename to .zip, unzip.~~\nED: Go to this link:\nhttps://anonfile.com/79R1c039n9/update_08chan_s_Millchan_version_201908141821_zip\n6. Follow enclosed instructions.\n7. Clear browser cache and refresh.\n\nPlease disseminate this information to other boards.",

Lawyers, police officers, FBI, and so-called \"private\" prisons can profit off arresting people for dumb shit (as with drugs), justifying ever-increasing budgets because if you give me just a little bit more funding, the whole problem will go away, which is very funny when you consider that the FBI runs CP websites. \n>tfw you ask for more money to stop yourself from engaging in the criminal activity that you are assigned to prevent\n\nMaking the act of possessing CP a crime also imposes fixed costs on ISPs, who are required by U.S. law to maintain records of internet activity for 1 year. It's also a great vehicle for surveillance laws becuase nobody wants to be caught dead publicly objecting to it. As we have seen this also discourages people from going anonymous and using the dark web because muh accidentally seeding child porn. Even though discouraging internet anonymity is not ostensibly the intent of the law, it is absolutely unquestionable because if you do you're a pedophile. It's like how governments ban large denomination currency because it's \"used by criminals\" and therefore we should ban it.",

Though it wasn't flashy, it was quite well paced, tastefully limited the number of gags, and the interactions between the characters were not unlike what you'd see from people in real life. Nepotism is a real issue pretty much everywhere, and though some people would argue that the episode went back on its \"anti-nepotism\" message by having Starlight hire two of her friends, I'd say that the point of \"anti-nepotism\" is not to avoid hiring your friends but simply to avoid hiring your friends into jobs for which they are wholly unsuited or unqualified. The episode was written by someone who, according to her IMDb page, apparently has never written an MLP episode (or an episode for a children's show) before, which may explain why it feels so different.",

Even programming is an abstraction. Most people who are interested in writing any functioning software at all use libraries and a compiler. I shouldn't need more than a cursory understanding about how video codecs and formats work to use ffmpeg. Obviously it would help if I did, but time scarcity is a factor of human life. We can't all be experts in everything, nor should we try to be. The problem is with the implementation of abstractions, not the concept of abstractions itself: really when abstractions lead the users to make false assumptions about how the underlying system works.  Like when OOP programmers who got stuck in the realm of \"objects\" lost their ability to think about the OS and underlying memory, so they got used to the idea of doing millions of dynamic allocations of small \"objects\" per second and running a \"garbage collector\" to free all the memory.\n\n>Each UI has its own learning curve and retarded idiosyncrasies\nI don't see how this puts CLI above GUIs. A lot of CLI programs have idiosyncrasies with regards to how arguments are parsed, what single-letter arguments mean, what combination of arguments is acceptable, what format of arguments is acceptable, etc. and they certainly all have learning curves. I think it's just a factor of existence for UIs. Vi/Vim, for example, could hardly be said to lack a \"learning curve\". You'd be hard pressed to find a single person who has all the command line options for ffmpeg memorized. Even in REPL programs like calc and wpa_cli I have a hard time remembering whether to type \"exit\" or \"quit\" to exit because I don't use either program frequently enough.\n\n>They are able to navigate UI's but not much more.\nI don't think using a CLI inherently makes one more \"tech-literate\" than \"tech-literate millennials\". CLIs tend to be less separated from the hardware than GUIs, true, but part of that is due to insane schemes by software vendors to deliberately obscure the internal functions of the system from users (e.g. how smartphone OSes offer filesystem browsers which don't allow you to access the actual filesystem but rather display a range of items sorted into categories like \"Pictures\"/\"Music\").  These schemes are supposed to make things simpler for the user, but often they're implemented in a clumsy manner (see above). The end result of this is that when everything works, the user doesn't notice, and if anything goes wrong, the user is completely ill-equipped to fix it. For instance, I have a professor in uni who tries to open PDF presentations every lecture by clicking on them. He ends up pulling up Internet Explorer, which for some reason can't access the PDF via a file URI. He doesn't understand that he can open Acrobat Reader and just open the file through there, so he chalks it up to \"computer problems\" and either opens the presentation via Google Drive (online) or just starts drawing on the board. \n\n>Running something in the terminal is simple, verbose, and universal\nThe terminal is often verbose, and for certain tasks, simple. There's certainly some merit to the concept of users being able to pipe strings or objects between programs and writing scripts to do so, which I would call \"composability\". But there's hardly the kind of universality I'd think you're referring to.

			"body": ">You can think of this in a very simple way and just bring up how there are few technological innovations like what was seen pre-Cold War. You could argue that the innovations stopped earlier, like following the end of the second World War, but I'm working under the assumption that the Moon landing was real.  \n\nWell, I'm not familiar with the entire realm of technology. What I do have is a microelectronics textbook from 2008 that said \"Chips with 65nm features will likely be common by the time you read this book\".\n\nI could point to things like AI (compare voice recognition 10 years ago, when it was mostly a joke, to today), batteries, blockchain, CRISPR, gene therapy, graphene, robotics, smartphones, nanotech, superconductors. You could say that all of these things are \"pipe dreams\" or that they only serve to expand the surveillance state, take people's jobs, etc. but like it or not, they are examples of technological development. Maybe they won't last, but that's for the future to decide.\n\nInnovation is fickle. Sometimes, something is invented, and it turns out to be completely useless. That means it's subject to survivorship bias. We don't remember the things that were \"invented\" in the past and never used.  Sometimes, innovation pops out of nowhere.  Sometimes, inventions lie dormant for decades, considered a \"pipe dream\" or a consumer novelty, until somebody finds a use for them, like optical fibers, which were mostly used for novelty decorations, although many hypothetical, experimental uses were devised for them prior to modern fiber optic communications. Remember that ARPAnet started in the 60s; it took 30 years for the world wide web to swing around; and it took 20 more years for the Internet to reach the scale it has today. \n\nBecause we're actively living through technological change (i.e. you have to wait for it, rather than reading about it all at once in a textbook) and because of the inherent barriers between research and the market, the impact of technological innovation doesn't become apparent immediately, and it's very difficult to point at an instance of one thing that's been invented and say \"that is the quintessential technological innovation of our era\". \n\n>Speaking of, ask yourself why we were able to put a man on the moon about 50 years ago but nowadays we have trouble even getting an unmanned spacecraft into orbit, let alone the moon. \n\nBecause space travel is a political project, and it isn't actually economical.  It is entirely dependent on the funding of government agencies. Though often glorified as an example of \"technological progress\" and what governments can achieve given massive amounts of funding, the reason that you don't see extravagant moonshot projects like space colonies from private corpoations and research teams (excepting the ones like Tesla living off subsidies and the Fed suppressing interest rates) is because that they don't often make much sense.  Quite frankly, there just isn't that much in space that is accessible enough and valuable enough for us to have any reason to go there.\n\n>Also keep in mind how the more technology 'progresses', the more things stay the same. Smart phones, for instance, are becoming way too similar. They're doing the opposite of forking, and are instead 'merging' into one gadget.  What's the next innovation? Uhh, a new camera lens! What about for game consoles? Well, we're making it stream stuff better (not really)!\n\nWell, if you focus on one subset of technology like \"smart phones\", and if you look for innovation on an annual basis, of course it's going to look like \"technology\" is converging--and it's kind of reflective of the two \"markets\" for consumer technologies: expansion/adoption markets, when there are people who have never used a product before buying into it for the first time, and replacement markets, when just about everyone has one and people buy things to replace old ones that are broken. Think about consumer appliances, which are largely replacement markets. How much have the microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, or laundry machine changed in the past few decades? Fundamental changes to technology take longer, and when they do come often they're paradigm-shifting changes--the \"next big thing\" need not fall into the category of a \"smart phone\".",

			"body": ">>463ef259-c4f6-415e-85c1-9ba4e030a27e\n>Remember that Steve Jobs interview? I'd be surprised if you haven't seen it already. He was right. Sure, he said that when Apple was much smaller than what it is today, and the problem he was describing, one could argue, is something only the big corporations experience and not the smaller fish fighting over scraps. Keep in mind, however, that the majority of the money flow for each industry goes to those big corporations, and they more often than not set the standard. A real innovator and entrepreneur could make it to the top and create serious waves, but I haven't seen or heard of any such major breakthroughs. \n\nIt's kind of ironic. I think Apple's on its way out now because it's running in the exact way that Steve Jobs warned against--focusing on walling customers in with their proprietary chargers and earphones instead of providing value and making new things. I also think that a lot of the tech companies (i.e. Google) have been trying to learn from the mistakes of earlier tech giants, because their strategy these days has been to go around and absorb lots of smaller companies conducting weird, out-there projects, rather than getting stuck focusing on one venture. And they've been known to go out on a limb and try all kinds of ventures (remember Google Glass, Google+)?\n\nAnd if you want to talk about companies making waves--well, they are. Maybe not as quickly as you'd like. Look at the Top 10 S&P 500 companies since 1980: \n\n>1980: IBM, AT&T, Exxon, Standard Oil of Indiana, Schlumberger, Shell Oil, Mobil, Standard Oil, Atlantic Richfield, General Electric\n\n>1990: IBM, Exxon, General Electric, Philip Morris, Royal Dutch Petrol, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Wal-Mart Stores, AT&T, Coca Cola\n\n>2000: General Electric, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, Citigroup, Cisco Systems, Wal-Mart, Microsoft, AIG, Merck, Intel\n\n>2010: Exxon Mobil, Apple, Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric, Wal-Mart, Google, Chevron, IBM, Procter & Gamble\n\t\n>2019: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, Visa\n\n>Really, think back into recent years and tell me what \"good\" has been developed in recent years that has made a major impact and ended up being financially successful? Virtual Reality? That can't be said to have even lifted off yet, and to say it's been a financial success is a stretch.  I'd even say we're going backwards with Virtual Reality rather than forwards. \n\nWell, phenomena like the smartphone that take off a few years after their invention are quite rare (and really, I'd consider the PDA, which has been around since the 80s, to be a precursor to the modern smartphone--and I used to actually have one). And again, we don't often remember the ideas that failed in the distant past--only the ones that failed recently. And I would also mention that technological innovation doesn't have to be limited to a physical, tangible gadget like an iPhone or a VR headset. It could easily take the form of a service, for example, ridesharing (bypassing taxi monopolies which have been around forever) or delivery services. They may not be very impressive, but not every innovation has to be some monolith--sometimes just improving the life of the consumer a little bit can create opportunities for future saving and investment. See previous paragraphs. \n\n>Also, regarding your reply to 4383's thoughts on GUI's and shit - I think you got the wrong idea. Suffice it to say that there's a big difference between making things more convenient to save the user's time and blatantly obscuring settings/files/etc preventing you from making changes to your hardware.  Proprietary software, basically. You have to install iTunes and go through a ton of elaborate steps just to make a custom ringtone on your iPhone these days. You can see what he's talking about if you work with Windows 10 and Windows 7 computers as well. \n\nI was making the point that GUIs are not inherently evil. I am well aware of the issue of companies using proprietary shitware that boxes users into operating in a walled-garden environment. It's unfortunate that people have really grown accustomed to the lack of freedom. Thankfully, I don't use an iPhone.",

We can get away with it because ultimately we possess a unique combination of worldwide military presence and a shitty, but less shitty than everyone else's government and central bank. The relative soundness of our currency ironically contributes to the leverage we have to buy Chinese labor for very few USD.\n\nThe fact that Chinese business conditions are much more favorable to manufacturers is also a function of regulations on businesses back in the States (the CFR was around 80,000 pages long in 2014--and it covers regulations on things like \"Macaroni and Noodle Products\"--and those are just the federal regulations!) and inflexible state/federal mandated benefits like unemployment/disability insurance, social security, medicare/medicaid, worker training, family leave, workman's compensation that heavily increase the cost of labor here. Also IMO if one wanted to give businesses a reason to move back to the US one should just let the whole Hong Kong thing play out and China kill their own golden goose instead of intervening. This has been demonstrated with many states--Venezuela, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, etc--people are EXTREMELY wary of starting a business in a country where they know that their business could be expropriated at any time. \n\n>Advantage? There's no need for micromanagement via central government.\nHow do you plan to enforce the expiration of currency?\n\n>But even if things became so frosty between China and the US where trade stopped altogether - would you care? Sure there would be adjustments. Some might be severe. But we'd also gain considerable freedom of action. Without trade, no one would care what Chinese thought about issues. We could act based upon our own rationales.\nI'm inclined to disagree. The total cessation of trade between two states can make war between them much more likely, simply because there are no more shared interests between the two. The decision of war becomes a simple matter of \"Do I stand to lose more by waging war or by passing by the resources and power available within this country?\", since neither side is engaged in market exchange with the other. \n\nAlso, on the use of the language \"cessation of all trade\"--remember that in the real world, trade is extremely unlikely to simply \"stop\" on its own (e.g. people in China and US voluntarily decide to stop trading with each other), so really the cessation of trade would be effected by blockades and tariffs. I would hardly consider those \"freedom of action\" from the viewpoint of anyone except the U.S. government. It's true in a semantic sense that the cessation of freedom of trade \"frees\" one from having to consider the effects of what the Chinese thought on one's businesses, a bit like imprisonment \"frees\" one from the responsibility of having to consider where to eat lunch. It also \"frees\" one from having to consider those effects on business when considering military action.",
