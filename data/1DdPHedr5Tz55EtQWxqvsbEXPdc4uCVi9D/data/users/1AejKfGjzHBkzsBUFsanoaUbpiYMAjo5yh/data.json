There is literally so much javascript chugging that my browser slows down to 0.00005FPS and it's like watching a slideshow on a core i7. \nNot to mention the fact zeronet is non anonymous AT ALL unless you configure it in like 4 different laces, and for some reason it requires the ability to administrate the tor daemon itself via the control port. something that an orfinary tor application would NEVER be given access to.\nALSO the fact that apparently this is some kind of P2P application and it's being shoehorned into tor rather than a darknet much better suited for P2P like I2P.",
