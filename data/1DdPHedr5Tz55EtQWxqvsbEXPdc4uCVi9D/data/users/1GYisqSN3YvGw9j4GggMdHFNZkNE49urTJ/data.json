			"body": "You can use this python script in order to help keep an eye on what thumbnails you're seeding, and help prevent glowniggers from poisoning the well. Run it from your root zeronet folder (the one with the data folder). It will get a list of all your thumbnails for 08chan, and then copy them into a directory in your zeronet root folder. This way you can easily browse and identify any files (or users) you want to block. You can let the script run and it will do this every 15 minutes on its own. You can also modify it to change the loop rate, or to include all image files if desired.\n\n[code]\nimport os\nimport time\nimport glob\nfrom shutil import copy2 as copy2\n\nthumbs = glob.glob('data/1DdPHedr5Tz55EtQWxqvsbEXPdc4uCVi9D/data/users/*/*thumb.jpg')\nthumbpath = 'thumbnails/'\n\nif not os.path.exists(thumbpath):\n\tos.makedirs(thumbpath)\n\t\nfilelist = open(\"thumbnails/files.txt\", \"w+\")\n\t\nwhile True:\n\tcount = 0\n\tfor file in thumbs:\n\t\tif not os.path.exists(thumbpath+file):\n\t\t\tcopy2(file, thumbpath)\n\t\t\tcount+=1\n\t\n\tfor filename in thumbs:\n\t\tfilelist.write('{}\\n'.format(filename))\n\t\n\tprint(\"All new files moved to \"\"thumbnails\"\" subdirectory.

The folder the file is in is the user's ID. The content.json file in that folder will contain all their posts. So if you want to block that file and their posts you can just delete their folder.\n\nEdit: I modified the OP again to also create a text file with a list of the files and their locations which is placed in the thumbnail folder.",
