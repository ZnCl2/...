			"body": "You're right that he's at best a centrist and he has some either suspicious or naive attitudes, but you are misrepresenting some some things and quoting some things he said out of context. He's right that ZeroNet's current design has many issues with it that nofish has been slow to fix. This is not something he has mentioned, but for example, allowing sites to create new auth_addresses has been requested by Millchan's developer to make his anonymous posting functionality possible, and nofish made a comment on it but nothing ever came out of that. And although it wasn't his point when he made the spam (I agree he probably did it as both a power grab), one person with a Python script shouldn't be able to take down Tor registration.\n>One anon discovered in folder /data/filters of Krixano zite http://127.0.0.1:43110/kxonet.bit/?/create-id three files: anti_jew.json, anti_lgbt.json, license_offending.json.\nActually, the blocklist is part of kxonet.bit, which includes many services besides ID creation, including those blacklists. As far as I know, Krixano wouldn't be able to force users of the KXoID service to subscribe to those blacklists (although yes, obviously it casts suspicion on Krixano of being a leftist jew and so on).\n>\"The code that registers (KxoID) users is in 0background.py, and yes, that one can be controlled by Krixano (or those who have the keys, right, e.g. me). \"\nThat script is run on a Python sandbox which is supposed to prevent access to any dangerous functions beyond the normal ZeroID javascript API. The method used is a little sketchy from the engineering perspective, but so far I haven't been able to come up with any possible exploits with the conceptual understanding of how the sandbox works, although I haven't actually audited the code.\n>\"That's right, plugins can be unsafe.\"\nThe point of plugins is that they can extend ZeroID in arbitrary ways, so it's close to impossible to make them run safely. 0background.py is not a plugin, it's a BackgroundProcessing script.\n>his need for coloboration in Zeronet development\nIn the \"roll call\" thread he implied he's going to fork ZeroNet. We'll have to see whether that will be a good or a bad thing in the long run.",

I don't post because of the privacy concerns, only lurk using Tor Browser.\nThe sheer volume of posts means that even if 99% of everything posted is shit, most of the times I check in there will be at least one interesting thread in the catalog. And also there's a lot of interesting information on the archives. 4plebs publishes db dumps, I downloaded one to have in case the Internet goes down. But I still gotta figure out how to access it, I guess I would have to install FoolFuuka.\nUnfortunately I don't know of any publicly available 8chan db dump. It seems the only way to get the old posts would be through scraping the Wayback Machine.",

Look up videos of gas bombs on youtube. The only effective way to kill people with gas is pouring it on them. But I suppose if it's all you have molotovs it is.\nDo you have a car? Maybe you could try to run them over. Would probably be even more effective if you put some puncturing objects in the front.\nMaybe make some kind of spear or club with nails glued on it too.\nWhat weapons do the nigs have?\nEdit: oh they are drug dealers and you only have a crossbow? If not a LARP and they have real weapons and you don't and you're outnumbered 3 to 1 you're dead then. Best bet would be to get the fuck out. How would you know they would come at night anyways though?\n>>1c38adc7-ee02-4420-9de9-6b8d221485ad\nGas is shit tier as a weapon but it could make them ill enough to decrease their effectiveness so not a bad idea\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6uLUaqgWY0",

I've been here helping OP with his technical retardation since hours after 8chan went down but it's clear I shouldn't just for a mentally challenged individual like you to come here and shit all over my efforts. You don't like shilling on 4chan, hmm? Where are you shilling it instead? On the endless Discord clique RETARDED honeypot boards like Neinchan, Spacechan or vch, or the faggot weeb board that created the excuse for a man that is going to spend the rest of his life in prison for failing to get through a fucking wooden door? Or do you suggest we let this place rot while waiting for the remaining 2 users to fuck off? Yeah, that actually sounds like an excellent idea bro!\nTell me if you think you're so cool, because maybe I'm not getting it, when was the last time any of those RETARDED Discord clique LARPer boards had any worthwhile content AT ALL, like the ham radio general thread that has been going on for the last couple days on 4chan? That's right, never. Because the people on those boards are FAGGOTS who don't actually have anything interesting going on in their lives to talk about. It's a honeypot, sure, but at least it's not a honeypot filled exclusively with 85 IQ level 12 year olds.\nSo you can go ahead and blow your brains out, you'll be doing all of us a favor you worthless piece of shit.",
