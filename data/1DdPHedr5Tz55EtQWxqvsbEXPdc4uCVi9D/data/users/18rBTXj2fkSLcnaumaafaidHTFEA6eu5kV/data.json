Infact, from what I have read, exit polls were off in several states all favoring the republican party which indicates voter fraud on Trumps behalf. The only evidence i've seen for fraud on behalf of Biden has been shoddy at best and, at worst, unreliable, or, debunked statistical data.\nFrankly, I hate Joe Biden, but, ngl the bantz are bretty good.",

You are confusing a non existent conspiracy with factual evidence. Even if there was some cabal of dark suits running the show trying to prevent daddy trump from being reelected that wouldn't, in and of itself, presume voter fraud.
