At least for a while. \n\nOn the other hand, the old 8chan did work better. Also, you didn't need seeders to keep a file online. The central server did all the work for you. This is both a blessing and a curse.",

Yeah, there's probably some brain damage, but shit's impressive that it works. Also, it's not fully decentralized, the owner of the site can still delete shit if he wants (whatever updates he makes have priority in the 'hive mind').
