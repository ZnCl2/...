			"body": "CPI = Consumer Price Index = Price for a basket of goods normal people buy (food etc)\n\nFederal Reserve targets 2%-3% per year inflation by CPI. This means everything you buy gets 2-3% more expensive every year.\n\nWhile CPI does correlate to cost of living and quality of life, it does not track inflation. This is because all of the CPI goods get easier/cheaper to produce every year. This is called Productivity Improvement. For example, 1 acre of Iowa corn field produces almost 10x as much corn as it did in the 1950s.\n\nSo if everything is getting cheaper to produce, why is everything going up in price? Actual inflation is much higher than CPI. Actual inflation is CPI * Productivity Improvement.\n\nThis ends up being around 5-10% per year, or about how much the stock market grows every year! (The stock market isn't going up so much as the dollar is going down)\n\nThe attached picture is from wikipedia and shows that this massive inflation coincides with when the dollar was taken off the silver standard in 1963. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce_productivity#/media/File:US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg)\n\nThe Federal Reserve was planned by the rich for the rich at a secret meeting. Take note of the members list at the bottom that includes almost every American billionaire of the time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island_Club#Role_in_the_history_of_the_Federal_Reserve\n\nThe US dollar is a conspiracy to make average people slaves to the ultra-wealthy. Average Americans are less than a quarter as wealthy as we were in the 50s. Wealth equals power. The ultra-wealthy want to take all of our power so they can control us.\n\nBuy Monero (https://getmonero.org) via Bisq (https://bisq.network/) to escape the dollar's grasp! Do not buy Bitcoin -- modern analytics cause it to be non-private / non-fungible.\n\nEducate others that this has been happening! The only way to avoid slavery is if the majority of people understand that they are in the process of being enslaved and we elect representatives who give us a new monetary system.",

			"body": "Yes, the definition of inflation is \"increase in prices\", but which prices? As I demonstrated, consumer goods do not have a stable value; they reduce in value over time. (They take less work and resources to produce)\n\nThere are many asset classes which could have been chosen instead of consumer goods to track inflation. For instance stocks, commodities, and real estate.\n\nThe choice to use consumer goods for the main inflation metric of the Federal Reserve was done on purpose to pull wool over the public's eyes. Remember that we moved off valuing the dollar on silver, so this isn't some magical idea. We went from valuing the dollar on silver to basically valuing it on food plus a compounding 2.5% per year.\n\nThat was done on purpose because they knew most people wouldn't understand the concept and would accept getting poorer over time if it meant they had a similar lifestyle.\n\nTalk about \"panem et circenses\"",

			"body": ">If something had a stable value, then by definition it wouldn't show inflation nor deflation. But that doesn't matter anyway, because nothing in the economy has a stable real value.\n\nThat's not true unless you also consider the USD to have a set value, which it does not. The USD's value is constantly dropping even versus consumer goods, so its inflation versus other asset classes that are more stable is greater. By more stable, what I mean is assets with more fixed supply and demand.\n\nThe global equity market actually has somewhat fixed supply and demand because it is the valuation of the profit on global production. That global production is derived from the number of workers times their productivity. The workers' products may devalue over time due to productivity increases increasing supply, but the profits per worker do not. Profits tend to go up with new technological discoveries, but settle and stabilize as competition increases.\n\nThis means global profits, and by proxy equity markets, are relatively stable versus the total population of the world.\n\n>Stocks aren't a good way of tracking inflation, because then it would show inflation no matter what (even if the prices of goods and services were becoming cheaper) unless you're in a recession. Stocks track how valuable companies are, not inflation of real goods.\n\nStop and think about your assumption on why stocks always increase in value. What is the mechanism for that? Maybe your assumption is based on USD being stable when in fact it is not. Maybe stocks are actually the stable asset and USD is the asset that is artificially falling in relation to them.",

			"body": "> What good has a more fixed supply and demand than consumer goods? Medical goods have more or less fixed demand but variable supply, and real estate has a more or less fixed supply but variable demand. And when I hear \"inflation\" I expect they're talking about something more general than just real estate or medical goods or [insert asset class here\n\nConsumer goods have increased in supply dramatically, far greater than their demand. Remember my 10x corn example?\n\n> No. Machines are always being added to factories. Technologies are always being improved. Products created. Etc. It has an ever growing supply compared to the increase in the demand (which population growth nonetheless, is slower than the growth of companies).\n\nMachines create products, not profit. As I said \"The workers' products may devalue over time due to productivity increases increasing supply, but the profits per worker do not devalue.\"\n\nProfit margin of the S&P500 averages around 5% every year and its been that way for a long time.\n\n1) Why is this constant 5% profit margin constantly raising in valuation versus the dollar by 8% per year? Answer: Because that 5% profit margin is roughly 8% larger in its USD valuation each year.\n2) Why is the USD valuation of business profits 8% greater in USD each year? Answer: Because USD money supply has increased by a similar amount (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2), and there is equivalent production and consumption increases in terms of USD.\n\nWhat causes this 8% growth in consumption? Did you make 8% more money last year? Did you spend 8% more? Did the population grow 8%? Where is 8% more consumption coming from? We know 2.5% is caused by CPI, but what about the rest?\n\nAll I know is someone is able to spend some 5-10% more per year, and it isn't average people. If that's true, average people are getting poorer each year relative to total global wealth. If their USD income is 5-10% less valuable each year relative to global wealth, then that should be the metric we use to track inflation, because ultimately the standard inflation metric should allow someone to accurately compare USD between two different years. Currently it only shows buying power in terms of living essentials, not true wealth.\n\n>If that was the case we'd expect equity to grow at the same rate that, say, precious metals or real estate. But it grows faster than those two.\n\nPrecious metals have both a constantly increasing supply and a constantly increasing demand. As their price raises, mining for them becomes more economical. They aren't stable, but they are more stable than the USD. Business profit is priced by the market at the cost of business risk, which has nothing to do with technology, and it grows at a similar rate as the population. Thus, most of the growth in equity markets is actually caused by currency depreciation.\n\nReal estate is complex to evaluate because of worldwide manipulation in lending practices. Subsidized loan rates and collateral requirements have caused real estate to be extremely leveraged, which of course causes the prices to go up. I haven't evaluated it properly but I don't believe real estate is a good asset to call \"stable.\" It is an interesting thought experiment to think about how much more affordable housing would be if loan rates, collateral, and mortgage insurance weren't subsidized.",
