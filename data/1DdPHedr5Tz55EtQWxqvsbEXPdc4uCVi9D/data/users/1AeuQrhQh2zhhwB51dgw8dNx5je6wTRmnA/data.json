Dramatically lower peer count for any given version of the file than if everybody was downloading and seeding a single file.\n>all is needed is ffmpeg or vlc installed i think\nYou can't call native programs from a web browser's javascript. So ZeroNet can't use ffmpeg, it would have to use whatever API the browser offers for encoding, or just a javascript encoder.",

I didn't know about that document.\nStill, it's better than barebacking, since they might not be able to de-anon automatically and might have to assign a few analysts to run the data for a period of time to crack any given user. Maybe increasing the route length from the default 3 nodes would work.\nThe guys who complain about CP have a legitimate concern. There's nothing preventing you from inadvertently downloading CP thumbnails and seeding them. And then there are the bugs where files from muted boards are still downloaded, and the trick where the thumb and actual file can be individually changed after publishing a post.",
