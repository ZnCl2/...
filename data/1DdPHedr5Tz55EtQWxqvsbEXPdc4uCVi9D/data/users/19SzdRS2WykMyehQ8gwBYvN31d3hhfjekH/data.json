I wish I could assume you were stupid but well-meaning, but I'm sure that isn't the case here.  Shills have been screaming to people to avoid this place all day yesterday.  Why?  Because this is a domain completely out of their control.",

The buildup of many coincidences and softer proofs like notable high ranking officials saying weird things, having documents revealed or seeing (and feeling!) unexplained lights is the proof generally accessible today. This prevents mental conflict among people that are not ready for this Truth but provides those that are awakened with confirmation, similar to how Q operates.\n\nRecently we have had new information released through FOIA requests and some minor disclosures in the media. By comparing official documents and ways government organizations react to UFO/ET question and various \"insider\" information, you can paint a clearer picture. Seek and you shall find.\n\nAlways use discernment. Don't just spam your info, make sure it's at least logically sound, reasonable and backed with what little facts we have. All rules of physics and logic apply even if it's not understandable from our limited perspective. This is a serious research thread even though many will still dismiss all talk about the matter out of ignorance and various belief systems and go to various lengths to fight other anons who may hold different opinions. This kind of behavior serves no one but the shills.\n\nRespect your fellow anons. Do not fight, search for Truth. See how small pieces fit in the big puzzle. Present and let the Truth fight for itself. And remember, our Universe is infinite and inhabited.",
