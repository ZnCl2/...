I'm not even sure the validating server would technically be a CA at all. The user would create a @08chan self signed cert. Then, before posting, it would send that auth_address through the clearnet (or Tor) to a server that would sign it and give the signature to the user. Then the user needs to append that signature to his data.json (I guess, or some other file) or other clients won't accept posts made by him.",

The hard part is sticking to it, yeah, but don't focus to much on programs and stuff, it doesn't matter. Just lift heavy things for a few hours per week.\n>inb4 muh muscle imbalance\nIt's a meme.",

Maybe the zite could detect if you're using the default ZeroNet client and give you a link to download a patched one. Or maybe a whole new ID system could be implemented on top of ZeroNet where posts aren't associated to auth_address but to an alternative ID system, and auth_addresses are just used to seed content and not to sign posts. But that would probably imply writing another imageboard engine from scratch. But also it would be a more elegant solution to decouple the data distribution backend (ZeroNet) from the user authentication system.",

If that's so then I don't see what's the problem. All we need is the board's code to be able to force a new self signed auth_address, everything else can be done without ZeroNet's cooperation.",
