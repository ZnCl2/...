I never had trouble posting before or after the ZeroID update, but am I missing a wave on invisible posts I'm not even aware of?\n\nI don't have any users or boards muted either. So it can't be that.",

Click on the thumbnail and most images will load. I'm seeding all the images here, except for the broken TOR image and 3 other ones. The vast majority after clicking on [Seed] told me there were 0 seeds, but that was obviously wrong.\n\nSo basically ignore [Seed] and click to open the images instead to ensure you seed everything you want to seed.",
