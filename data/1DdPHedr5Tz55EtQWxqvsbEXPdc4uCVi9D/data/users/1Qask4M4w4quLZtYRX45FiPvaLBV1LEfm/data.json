Glows and political shill interest groups have budgets that they could use for strategic spamming. Most anons aren't going to want to give money for this sort of thing, especially if they don't fully trust whoever they'd be giving money to. Whoever came up with this autism clearly hasn't ever organized and fund-raised for events before. If you paywall your participants even a little bit, participation will suffer and over time the majority of the people posting will trend toward people with the wrong motivations, thus killing the culture. It's not even a good money-making scheme because rewarding voluntary donations has a better payout than preventing free-riders for this sort of thing. I've tested that assertion repeatedly and get the same result every time. Nevermind the fact that Bitcoin is a pain in the ass to get ahold of in some areas without doxing yourself to some kike middleman company.",

That's what we need the most right now, I think. We need a crypto-craigslist. There's all kinds of work I'd do if someone offered me Bitcoin or Ethereum or, hell, even Namecoin for it. Right now most of the crypto-work I've seen revolves around tech jobs like software development and database admin stuff. Don't miners ever just need someone to do blue collar work? Don't you have cars that need cleaning? House repairs or improvements? Lawn maintenance? Landscaping? Meal prep? Someone to drive you to your appointment in the city so that you don't have to find a place to park? Someone to pass out business flyers? If nobody is offering crypto for normal jobs, how the hell is it ever supposed to find its way into the hands of normal people?\n\n>>fd43142b-9528-4a2a-b0c5-54476021e0b5\n>they never thought that far ahead.\nWell he is a kike.
