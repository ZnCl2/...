			"body": "Monoeye:\n\nCyclops-breed that is human-sized.  They inherited some of the strength from the cyclops relations, but they are a timid race that doesn't fight unless it becomes necessary (hunting for animals). It is believed that they were a mostly-gatherer society that was able to adapt to human societies due to their passivity and being able to communicate.  Whether this was a something they were born with or something that the demon lord gave them, we are unsure.\n\n(HISTORY?)\n\nThey prefer darker, slightly cool climates, Nearby mountain bases with forests nearby.  Far away observations would show towns comprised of log cabins and cave networks nearby.  Monoeyes have inherited the strength of their larger Cyclops brethren, but they don't seem to use it to hunt down large game alot, but rather to create farmlands nearby the mountain caves.  They would wear large hats to protect their eyes due to the increased sensitivity of light they take in. Some do take roles with mining or constructing caves to hide in whenever a natural disaster occurs.  Those who do hunt game make sure to use all parts and help create clothing for all of their kind in the village.\n\nDue to them being a female only race, they depend on human men on reproduction.  The first men that discovered them were surprised about their appearance and were wary about their relations to a larger monster, but their more docile nature has made relations between the two more amicable, and they were able to share their knowledge of cultivation to one another, with Monoeyes learning how to care for animals more effectively, while the men learn how to create fertile farmland in more difficult soil conditions.\n\n(RELATIONS)\n\nSexual relations between the monoeyes and men are uncommon, but not so much as rare.  They are not a numerous race, but generations have grown to adapt thanks to each generation sleeping with men overtime, making them more resilient to all climates, but their sensitivity to light remains.  Most men that see them first glance even today would be scared by their large eye, so their numbers have not risen much back then despite the easier living conditions and technology.\n\nWhen one of them sees a man they like, they will approach them and keep in close proximity for an extended period of time.  They long for skinship, and would find ways to get the man to hold their hand or hug them close to get them more comfortable with their appearance.  This is a mating strategy due to a pheromone they release that will slowly make the man close to them hold them close as if they were a couple.  The increased sense of safety and longing will make the monoeye release more pheromone and the eventual cuddling will lead to slow, loving sexual relations.  These pheromones will be released even after their first mating, as to signal to others that this is their mate, and the others will leave them be.  Even with repeated encounters, it is ritual to cuddle after sex to show love and affection to one another.  Due to the specific nature of this pheromone, it has been dubbed \"Cuddlemone\".\n\n(HABITS)\n\nThey prefer the dark, and if they have to leave outside where it is bright, they will wear large hats or sunglasses to protect their eyes, they burn somewhat badly in harsh sun, so they wear loose, light long-sleeved clothing to cover their skin.  They love clothing when they were introduced to other materials like wool, silk, and cloth, and often love wearing costumes.\n\n**Writing these on a whim, don't mind me**",

In the meantime, more writefagging.\n\nHITOTSUME\n\nAn odd breed of the Monoeyes, it was first believed that they were results of crossbreeds by other races; Some like to drink like the Oni, while some dabble into dark magics like occutists.  Upon the demon lord's transformation, the actual truth was that they were the permanent cave dwellers of Monoeyes, somewhat similar to Gazers, but without much power.  In modern day society, they're usually forced to leave by their relatives and extended family to seek a mate.\n\nTheir moody disposition and cark complexions bring confusion to those who see them first glance.  However, they crave touch and skinship moreso than the usual Monoeye.  This desperation however has twisted these thoughs into 'I want to be teased...!', 'look down on me.', 'take advantage of me!'.  It is a thought system that was cultivated by their pathological obsession of skinship while not understanding human interaction.\n\nHISTORY\n\nFirst believed to be odd crossbreeds with other monsters way back, one sometimes can hear laughter, arguments, and chanting in the deeper parts of the cave networks of Monoeyes.  The Monoeyes don't mind their presence due since they are as passive as the other races, but their moody nature repelled them overtime.  They only came out of the caves when necessary to gather some of the food the Monoeyes cultivated, or offer some minor help so that they due their 'obligation' and slink back into their cave networks.  \n\nThey also inhertied the strength from the Cyclops breed, but their habits and diet have grown emaciated bodies, leading to even weaker physiques.  Their eyes are even more sensitive to light, and sometimes give an odd glow in their pupils, making some wonder if they were able to cast magic.\n\nIf one were to compare them today, they would be the modern Hihikomori.  No desire to go outside, thus family interventions are required for them to get outside if they ever want a mate.\n\n(RELATIONS)\n\nAn odd breed, their physique, combined with ther desperate thoughts have altered even their pheromones.  They dress in ways that titillate men, making them gaze at her form.  Any man she fancies she will stay with for longer periods of time, and her pheromones will give the man the urge to tease and overpower her.  Sometimes she resists, but the pheromones will come out stronger than ever during this exchange, and her nethers would start to leak greatly.  The man would then completely take advantage of her  and the both will mate until they're out of energy.\n\nDespite this, they still show affection, not so much outside, but they become less reclusive over time, their disposition becomes brighter, and their thoughts are less intense.  But the pheromones they emit will remain as they were for a long time.\n\n(HABITS)\n\nThey prefer darkness moreso than their monoeye counter parts, and oddly enough, prefer a more sterile environment as well.  it's this discovery that made the researchers wonder if there was a contradiction:  Dark damp areas were prone to create bacteria and other elements to grow, but to the Hitotsume, they grew an unusual immunity to them; it's as sterile as something cleaned with ethyl alcohol.\n\nThey also like clothing, but they prefer darker colors, whether it's dark reds or just blacks, They picked up the color schemes of the modern-day goth or perhaps picked up ideas from musicians that perform 'metal bands'.  Some speculate this is a front, but they insist this is what they like.",
