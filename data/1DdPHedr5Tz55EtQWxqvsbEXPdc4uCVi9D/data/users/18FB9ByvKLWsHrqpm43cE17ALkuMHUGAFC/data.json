He's just called out American Jews for their dual loyalty without being anti-semitic in any way at all. This is a move of such knife-twisting subtlety that the only people who will truly appreciate it are kikes. Those kikes who support the party of the four fucking nutcases now have to explain why they both support Israel and support a party that despises Israel. And they have no responses that don't sound like tired old 'but muh anti-semitism' because Trump followed up with quotes from people saying he is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world. What are they going to say? That he's anti-semitic? Uh, that doesn't work. That he hates Israel? Nope. That he hates Jews? Hardly. Instead the ADL and AIPAC have been reduced to vaguely whining about dual-loyalty as a political football that's long been used to attack Jews blah fucking blah instead of actually answering the question.  \n\nAnd Israel itself has been reduced to jumping when Trump says something. It released a statement denying Tlaib and Omar entry TEN FUCKING MINUTES after Trump said it would show weakness to allow them to visit. \n\nStop looking at what Trump says and focus on what he does. Netanyahu wants to build more settlements? No says Trump. Netanyahu wants more war in Syria? No says Trump - only on my terms when I'm ready. No President has ever been allowed to get away with telling Israel what to do. And because he constantly praises these people publicly they have to eat the shit sandwich with a smile.\n\nYou need to be 13+ to post here.",
