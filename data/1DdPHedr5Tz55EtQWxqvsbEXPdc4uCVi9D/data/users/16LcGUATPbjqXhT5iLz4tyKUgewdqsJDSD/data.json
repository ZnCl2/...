			"body": "Independent clearnet imageboards seem to be dying. Almost all the webring boards got reported to their hosters by some \"Esther B. Aronowitz\". The same thing happened to 9chan which basically is Jewsh deploying infinity next. Mark of /v/ made a new board and they are already going to lose their domain. 8kun is soon going to be less free than 4chan. Fatchan has shut down for now.\nPeople need to get on Zeronet, clearnet seems to be more and more lost, keeping stuff online becomes more and more expensive.",
