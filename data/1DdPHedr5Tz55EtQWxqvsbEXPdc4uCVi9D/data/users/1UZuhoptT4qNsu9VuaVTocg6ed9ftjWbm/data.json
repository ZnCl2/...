			"subject": "Dylann Roof Letter to Tucker Carlson",
			"body": "Page 1\n\nMay 12th 2019\n\nMr. Carlson,\n\nI’m aware that I am probably the last person you would like to get a  letter from. To be clear, I’m not looking for an interview or attention  or anything like that. I’m writing this as a personal letter to you in  the hope that whoever reads your mail will actually give it to you.\n\nI’ve been meaning to write to you for about a year now, but I’ve been  putting it off. But I knew that I needed to write you sooner rather  than later if I wanted to have any hope of it making a difference. I  watch your show almost every night, and most of the time I enjoy it. You  come across as a genuine person who believes everything he is saying,  whether you’ve written it or not. You seem to know which stories to  avoid – the ones that would force you to compromise your integrity and  beliefs – or the ones that, because of your platform, would force you to  carry water for mainstream conservatism. For example, Steve King and  Ilhan Omar or other stories related to Israel.\n\nThe real purpose of this letter is to try to convince you that you are uniquely positioned to do …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 2\n\n… something great. I don’t have any doubt that eventually you will be  taken off the air, regardless of how careful you are. As you know you  stand apart from the other commentators on FOX. But the fact is that you  are still well within the boundaries set for you by the left. You  correctly hate that Republicans and mainstream conservatives’ minds are  controlled by the left, and that they follow the rules created for them  by the left. They truly are controlled opposition – whether they realize  it or not. But you are as well.\n\nYou don’t have an issue pointing out the biological realities of sex  difference, and almost seem to consider yourself brave for doing so. But  you would never touch the race question. Imagine if things were to  continue on the path we are on at the moment, without falling apart. Sex  differences would become and absolutely verboten topic just like race  is. And no one, including a future Tucker Carlson type, would dare to  speak about it. It truly is the exact same thing, the difference being  that we are several decades further along with the race propaganda than  we are with the sex propaganda…\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 3\n\n… and by that I mean in the total denial of differences. Both racial  differences and sex differences are backed up by science, but you’re  only brave enough to talk (and I suspect, even think) about one, and if  you were living a few decades in the future you certainly wouldn’t be  brave enough to talk about that one either. In the same way, you can  talk about illegal immigration but wouldn’t dare to speak about black on  white crime. Think about that for a moment.\n\nOn your show you consistently preface your comments or qualify them  with caveats. I understand why you do it. The problem is that they come  across as weak, as if you are unsure of yourself, and you seem to  believe that without them your opinion may not be morally justifiable.\n\nNothing you say is anywhere near extreme enough to require a  qualifier or explanation. You don’t need to attempt to establish your  morality before you voice your opinion on something. As you well know,  the only people who would want you to do so hate you anyway. You  apparently understand the concept of never apologizing afterwards – I  only ask that you try to extend that …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 4\n\n… concept to, before or during any potentially offensive comment as  well. Besides, it really does come across as “some of my best friends  are black”–esque.\n\nBefore I go any further, I want to make it clear that I don’t harbor  any illusions about you. I know that you aren’t a racist or white  nationalist, and most likely don’t like me to say the least. You have  plenty of jews and blacks on your show. I’m not too familiar with the  power structure at FOX but I’m sure you have more than one jew  controlling you in some fashion. I’m aware that you are securely on the  conservative reservation. But at the same time you seem to be a  relatively free thinker.\n\nYou decry identity politics when the only effective solution is to  embrace them. As you know, what scares the left more than anything is  the thought of the right adopting their tactics. That is essentially  what white nationalism is. And they have a good reason to fear it,  because if adopted it would be able to resist their machinations. White  nationalism …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -",

			"body": "Page 5\n\n… is simply identity politics for whites, and is no more evil –  actually much less so – than identity politics in their non-white form.\n\nConservatives are losers and you are a loser by extension. Maybe you  don’t even consider yourself a conservative, but that is what you are.  Even if the left were able to be convinced to abandon identity politics,  all blacks became conservative and put American identity first, so on  and so forth, would that actually be a good thing? Conservatives think  so. But assimilation is actually much more dangerous to the survival of  the white race than multiculturalism is.\n\nYou have white children and therefore whether you like it or not, you  are invested in the white race. Regardless of whether you want to  accept your white identity or not, the enemies of the white race do  accept it and intend to destroy you for it. Once you accept the fact  that everything going on politically and socially is designed with the  goal of the destruction, displacement, replacement, dispossession,  marginalization, and …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 6\n\n… eventually the outright violent genocide of the White race, it  begins to make a lot more sense. You find racism to be morally  repugnant, why? Why is the acknowledgement of racial differences any  more repugnant than the acknowledgement of sex differences?\nAgain, this is the left’s control showing itself. It is morally  repugnant because of what they claim results from it. Whether it is  justified factually is irrelevant – we must deny it because of the  alleged harm it causes.\nIf the “progress” we are currently witnessing today continued unabated,  anyone who continued to deny the equality of men and women would  become the social equivalent of White nationalists today, and would be  denounced by the contemporary Tucker Carlsons.\nIn reality of course, the denial of race causes much more harm than the  acceptance of it. The denial of race by Whites is what put us in our  current situation to begin with. The adoption of racial identity by  Whites isn’t scary, as you and a guest agreed one night; it’s what must  and will eventually happen if White want to survive. I could go on  interminably but I will get to the real point …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 7\n\n… of this letter instead. You are uniquely positioned because your  high profile to help the White race. When everyone assumes you are an  evil White racist you don’t have anything to lose by becoming one… by  giving them what they think they want. The mistake conservatives make is  the refusal to give the left what it thinks it wants – all the while  thinking their refusal makes them more righteous. Time is running out.  The persecution really begins when we become the minority. We haven’t  seen anything yet. I’m in prison for giving them what they wanted, it’s  true. But it’s also possible to give them what they want without being  violent. Before I went to jail I would pace around literally saying  “I’ll give them what they want”. But that’s beside the point.\nMy request to you is that when the day comes, and you are taken off the  air, don’t waste what you’ve been given. I can assure you that a large  segment of the nationalist community would welcome you. Some allegedly  already see you as an ally. The alternative is that you will be forced  to water down your show, and thereafter fall into obscurity. If you do  nothing after you are deplatformed, you will fall into …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 8\n\n… obscurity, remembered for nothing. Even if you are somehow able to  maintain a following, no greatness will come with it. Because yours is a  losing ideology. On the other hand, if you are open minded enough to  honestly research and listen to what White nationalists are saying, and  to see that our interests align, you could be a remembered figure in the  historical record. Everyone loves mainstream recognition. The  conservatives crave validity from the left, and likewise the true  far-right would gladly accept recognition by a figure like yourself.\nBecause of your profile you could instantly become an influential  personality in the movement, assuming you had the humility to admit that  the people there before you may have known things you didn’t, and the  willingness to educate yourself and admit your past mistakes. You could  bring the more mainstream following you currently have over into racial  nationalism, making them more comfortable with the transition.\nPlease don’t make the mistake of believing there is any hope of avoiding  the inevitable pariah status you will undoubtedly enjoy soon enough.  Leverage it and make a name for yourself that will withstand …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -",

Surprise them with a preemptive strike, liberate  yourself on air, truly shocking them while you ride off into the sunrise  of better things and true greatness, denying them the pleasure of  bringing about your ostensible demise. Begin to cover the disgustingly  brutal racial terrorism Whites are subjected to on a daily basis by  non-White American citizens.\nForgive me while I backtrack for a page or two.\nYou rightly criticize the SPLC, but I wonder if you are really aware of  what its actual purpose is. The purpose is to discredit or shut down  anyone who even hints at the possibility of the existence of a White  identity.\nThis is what the hate against Trump for example has always been about.  They see the people who voted for him as the kind that could be  problematic in the future. Potential White nationalists if you will.  People who might not go along with their agenda forever. And if there is  one thing they’re good at it’s nipping things in the bud. You correctly  disagree with the designation of the CIS as a hate group, but I wonder  if you would …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 10\n\n… disagree with that design for other groups I wonder if you  understand that your most extreme White supremacist is in reality only  the equivalent of your average black or jewish person, or any other  non-white for that matter.\nThe point is that 25 years from now no one would question the CIS design either.\nI wonder if you are able to comprehend that the black conservatives you  sometimes have on are only conservative because they very smartly see it  as what’s best for their race. They understand that there is no White  racism and that civic American nationalism furthers their interests for  the black race. This is in direct contrast to White conservatives, who  subscribe to the ideology because they think it’s what’s best for  everyone, and they honestly believe in an unhyphenated American  identity. In other words, black conservatives are actually just  intelligent black nationalists, assuming we had the same criteria for  what is considered a black and White nationalist, which we obviously  don’t.\nTake me for example. I’m on death row for …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 11\n\n… attempting to bring attention to the suffering of the White race  (which is far greater that you’re aware of. And that’s not embracing  victimhood, it’s embracing truth). Am I evil? I don’t think I am. I’m no  more evil than the black supremacist that killed 5 police officers in  Dallas.\nYou’ll remember that Obama qualified/justified his actions in front of the dead’s families directly afterwards.\nThe double standards won’t miraculously go away, and pointing them out  isn’t petty although we are conditioned to think it is. The  persecution hasn’t even begun in earnest yet. We must accept the  inevitable. That’s all I’m asking of you.\nThe same dynamic I mentioned about black conservatives applies to jewish  conservatives as well. They certainly don’t care about the country as a  whole, and their loyalties are more than just divided. They are  actually undivided as they only care about what is best the jews. That  has been the case since time immemorial.\nI have clearly tried to use the drive of ego …\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nPage 12\n\n… to entice you into my camp, but I have good intentions.

			"body": "==COMMANDER ROCKWELL==\n\nBy James Harting (2014)\n>     Rockwell is the father of both contemporary, post-1945 National-Socialism, as well as the modern White Nationalist movement. Movement veterans are familiar with the important, dynamic figure and his career, but to newcomers he is little more than a name.\n>     Here is the authorized biographical sketch of Rockwell that was published by the American Nazi Party in the 1960s. My comments follow.\nWho Is George Lincoln Rockwell?\n>     George Lincoln Rockwell was born in Bloomington, Illinois, the home of his maternal grandfather on March 9, 1918. His father was a very successful headline comedian from 1912 until about 1935. His ancestors were German, French, English and Scottish, numbering among them many Revolutionary War figures, back to Marie Antoinette, the French queen.\n>     Rockwell was in Bloomington only until he was old enough to get out of the hospital, when he was taken on the vaudeville circuit by his parents. He then spent some time in New Jersey, New York and California, but most of the time in Boothay Harbor, Maine.\n>     He attended Hebron Academy, a prep school near Lewiston, Maine, after which he entered Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, majoring in philosophy. In college, Rockwell enjoyed and did well in science and other objective courses, but fought blindly and instinctively against the “sociology” and other similar departments which, unknown to him, were then preaching the Marxist environmentalism and egalitarianism, which have played such havoc with our human, biological sciences.\n>     Leaving Brown in the middle of his junior year, when it became obvious that the US would get into World War II. Rockwell enlisted as a Seaman in the United States Navy in Boston, Massachusetts. By the entrance of the US into World War II on December 7, 1941, he had entered Naval Aviation, and became a cruiser and battleship scout pilot and a fighter pilot. He served aboard the USS Omaha in the South Atlantic and off North Africa during the invasion. He was then sent to the naval photographic school for pilots, and assigned to the USS Wasp and sent to the Pacific. He also became a commander of forward air control operations for Marine Corps assault troops. He was at Guadalcanal, Guam and other Pacific “hot spots.” At the end of World War II he was commanding officer of a squadron in Hawaii, and had earned nine decorations.\n>     Released from active duty, Rockwell attended Pratt Institute Art school in New York, working part time in advertising and commercial art. In 1948, while still at Pratt, he won first prize of $1,000 in the National Society of Illustrators competition for a full page newspaper ad for the American Cancer Society.\n>     While still in the ready reserves as commanding officer of a squadron in Washington, DC, he launched a new magazine, ''U.S. Lady'', for the wives of US servicemen.\n>     In 1949, Rockwell founded the first big national advertising agency in the state of Maine. Recalled to active duty for the Korean War in 1950, he trained Marine and Navy pilots in close support of troops, and then was transferred to Iceland, where he became the commanding officer of a squadron at Keflavik.\n>     About this time he became deeply concerned about the way that all he had fought for in two wars was being turned over to communism.\n>     He noticed that almost all of the convicted communist spies and traitors, such as Julius Rosenberg, Ethel Rosenberg, Nathan Silvermaster, Harry Dexter White (Weiss), Robert Soblen, Morton Sobell, David Greenglass, Harry Gold, Miriam Moskowitz, Fred Rosenberg, and Sam Cohen (chief of the communist spies caught in Canada), and most of the communist intellectual leaders, such as Herbert and Bettina Aptheker, were racial Jews. He was especially shocked to find that Who’s Who in Jewry, published by the Jews themselves, listed many of these atheist communists very proudly as Jews, even though he had believed that the Jews were just a religion.\n>     Observing that Hitler has said that communism was Jewish, and that the Jews were out to degenerate the White race by subversion and race-mixing, Rockwell bought a copy of ''Mein Kampf'' and read it, even though he thought he already knew what was in it from all he’d heard. He was astonished to find that it was actually a brilliant analysis of the mess that Western Civilization has gotten into, and the only plan he’d ever seen to save the White race and its culture.\n>     For a number of years he tried to work with various rightwing organizations, all of whom believed, as he did for a while, that it was necessary to disguise one’s admiration for Adolf Hitler and National Socialism.\nmore...",

			"body": "...continued\n>     Finally disgusted with the emptiness, the weakness, the hypocrisy and especially the cowardice of the so-called “conservatives,” Rockwell determined to ''attack'' at last, flying the Swastika banner which came so close to saving Western Civilization and the White race. “Since our Cause is fundamentally the truth,” he explained to horrified friends, “I do not see how we can win by lying or misrepresenting what we are for fear of the Jews.”\n>     “The only times in the hundred years of the rise of communism that this plague has actually ever been BEATEN, it was beaten not by ‘conservatives,’ but by radicals and fighters whom the enemy calls ‘Nazis’ and ‘fascists,’ and whom they really fear. Only in Germany, Spain and Italy has communism ever been conquered. We are damned fools to be afraid to follow the only examples that have ever worked!”\n>     He hung up a Nazi banner in front of his home and dared the Jews to do something about it. They–and their friends and dupes–came in droves to “do something about it,” but Rockwell survived all the shootings, rocks and other Jewish “arguments.” The publicity gave him such a much needed platform from which to call the attention of his fellow Americans to the increasingly desperate situation of America and our great White family of people.\n>     Speaking at colleges, at great city rallies and to private groups, Rockwell has won a larger and larger circle of responsible Americans who begin to realize that the old pray-talk-petition-and-stamp-licking societies will not save America and our White race.\n>     Rockwell believes that it is now time for the White Man to take America back from the aliens, the minorities and the terrorists now in power under the demagoguery of cheap politicians. To do this we must win not the few in the rightwing, or the upper classes, but the millions and millions of our people. And to win these people we must offer something beside a lot of empty platitudes about freedom and the Constitution. Only National Socialism has a positive and progressive program for all the people, rather than just the upper class, and combines a concern for the purity and protection of the great White race with a fighting determination to stop all further mongrelization of our people.\n>     In five short years, Rockwell has led the American Nazi Party from a tiny and scorned band of roughnecks willing to take to the streets to fight treason and race-mixing, until today the Party has headquarters in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and most major cities, and commands a grudging respect of the enemy, even though there is a powerful censorship of the American right-to-know of what Rockwell is doing, as shown by an article in the Spring, 1965, issue of the Columbia Journalism Review by Ben H. Bagdikian.\n>     The Party publishes ''The Rockwell Report'' (monthly), ''The Stormtrooper Magazine'' (quarterly) and ''National Socialist World'' (quarterly), plus bulletins available to Party members only.\n>     Rockwell is presently organizing the WHITE GUARD–young, White fighting men to help protect society from the Black and Red revolution which has already overwhelmed police departments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Cleveland and other cities.\n\n>     ''(Comments by James Harting)'': For most of his career as commander of the ANP, Rockwell lived a shadowy existence on the fringes of the American political scene. He was misunderstood and rejected by the vast majority of his fellow White Americans, whom he dearly loved. He and his “tiny band of roughnecks” were alternately cursed, ridiculed and ignored by the mainstream media. They fought street battles without end with communist and Jewish thugs who sought to silence them by force, and spent many a night in jail, courtesy of hostile politicians and corrupt police officials.\n>     But throughout it all, Lincoln Rockwell’s warrior spirit of courage, integrity and heroic defiance was never broken.\n>     His persistence finally paid off in 1966, when thousands of White men, women and youth in Chicago followed his leadership in a spontaneous uprising against efforts to integrate all-White workingclass neighborhoods. The uprising culminated in the now-famous White People’s March of Sept. 10, 1966, in which hundreds of ordinary Whites followed Rockwell’s leadership under the sign of the Swastika.\n>     Tragically, within a year Rockwell was dead. On August 25, 1967, this authentic American hero fell beneath the bullets of a cowardly Marxist sneak-murderer.\n>     Yet, although Rockwell’s body died on the black August afternoon, his spirit lives on in the hearts and minds of White men and women everywhere who continue to draw strength and inspiration from his heroic example.\nmore...",
