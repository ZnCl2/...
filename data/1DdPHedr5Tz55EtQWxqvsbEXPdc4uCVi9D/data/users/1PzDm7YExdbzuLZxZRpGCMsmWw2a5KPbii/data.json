It's probably just that.\nThere was a memory leak that was causing huge memory consumption. It's allegedly been fixed now. I'll see if I can make another Zip of it sometime soon.",

			"body": "I was so lazy I never actually worked out. So I came up with a routine that only takes 24 minutes.\nDo\n-Rows\n-Squats\n-Deadlifts\n-Calf raises\n-Military press\n-Bench\n-Biceps\n-Triceps\nThe rules are: you only do each lift for 2 minutes doing as many reps as you can. If you can't do any more reps hold the weights static for 10 seconds and continue. If you can't do even that then put them on the floor or rack them for 10 seconds and continue. The third minute is spent setting up the weights or resting if there isn't anything to do. Repeat every day even if sore.\nThe key to a short workout is to make it as intense as possible, but not enough that you don't want to do it anymore. So measure your energy.\nMaybe it would be better to do 1 minute of each and then rest for 30 seconds, but that is inefficient because setting up the weights probably takes more than 30 seconds, and you add aerobic exertion to the mix while doing it. If you can leave multiple weights set up for every exercise during the whole session then it might work though.",
