I wish I actually had people to play CK2 with for grand goals like forming the HRE/Restoring Byzantium. **If this is what does in the site, then I am so fucked. no place to vent, and I'll be permanently forced to be a mundane faggot** **The backup plan should've been advertised better, It needs to be advertised better if the site makes it through this clusterfuck**",

I, however, still like this site's premise and how any DoS attack would be useless on this site. This place needs to be more heavily advertised as a proper backup when the main site goes back up. We've been too complacent when we shouldn't have even with shit like the April Fools Hack not giving a cause for concern and now everyone's been scattered again badly.",

That's what others have been doing.\nthat'll just keep the clutter and make future peers have to look at it. I'm not even sure if bumping works similar to the clearnet board since post numbers are different for everyone on this site. The more people mute them the less chance future peers that find this site will see the spam and think the board is dead. Just go to the board homepage, not the catalog, and start muting to make things easier.",
