An even better solution is to enable the html5 canvas only on 08chan and *only* when you upload an image. The Tor browser has the luxury of its own browser to do this with and zeronet does not, but a firefox plugin could easily be made to serve this same purpose. Ideally you'd have your own browser exclusively for Zeronet.\n\nFor now though you should re-enable these settings after every image upload. Maybe just have a temporary browser add-on that's just a toggle button for those settings, for convenience? Develop a solution that doesn't use the HTML5 canvas?",

			"body": "ALRIGHT, GUYS, GET IN HERE\nLet's turn this bunker into a home with a to-do list.\n\n#1. Fix image uploads on tor. Open for ideas on this, but not using HTML5 canvas for image uploads is probably the best solution.\n\n#2. Because the [seed] and [mute] functions are so critical to the health and function of this board, they should be emphasized in the UI, and explained via a sticky. Effectively they're the \"bump\" and \"sage,\" or \"upvote\" and \"downvote,\" respectively. Except it's actually relevant because you can self-moderate content this way and blackhole shit content.\n\n#3. Encourage Tor/VPN use and provide guides for PERSEC to make it difficult for an informed poster to be tracked. VPN use is a whole other topic though -- we need GOOD VPNs.\n\n#4. Implement user IDs that use the zeronet IDs, cross-thread. This is intuitive enough for native users to not be tracked this way, as they'd change their ID when appropriate, but lets us spot shills easily.\n\n#5. Add banners and spruce the place up. Make \"SEED CONTENT YOU LIKE YOU FAGS\" banners. Develop culture around self-moderation.\n\n#6. Go full text-board, or create a separate zite that is text-only. Solves the CP issue and the space issue in one go. Possibly make all images \"spoilered\" to prevent thumbnail saving?\n\n#7. Develop a culture of sincerity by taking a hard-line stance against zero-effort posters: \"If you don't put any effort into your post, then I don't want to see your post.\" [M]ute all non-effort posters. If shills are going to shill, they're gonna have to work a lot harder.\n\n#8. Add the thread update number that appears on tabs when a thread has new posts. This is a QOL improvement. This is the [1] you see on a tab when that thread updates with a new post.\n\n\nI'll edit this post to add to the list as more is posted.",

Not because they're particularly resistant to your ideas -- but because people aren't won over by logic and information in the first place.\n\nPeople are won over by social pressure, first and foremost. If your voice is the only dissenting voice and you are alone, people will see your ideas as alarming and terrifying as they imply loneliness and vulnerability, and you will be shunned as though you harbor some disease. Conversely, if your ideas are presented by a larger social group, which provides security with numbers and other means, they will adopt your ideas even with the absence of information and logic, as we see with the modern lemming.\n\nThe reason for this is evolutionary. People do not join social groups for their truthfulness. They do it for security. The sun-worshiping tribe of 1000 is always more alluring than the science tribe of 10.\n\nSo how do you develop this social group? Well, we're already on our way to it. Over time, our community has become much closer by necessity. It quickly becomes necessary to do that geographically as well, to focus our collective social influence onto some population. Machiavelli termed this \"colonization,\" the non-violent takeover of a territory. This is what our enemies are doing to us and it's about time we started fighting back.",

Have you really muted all the boards you aren't constantly monitoring for spam? You might be seeding spam right now on one of the boards you aren't active on.\nYou don't seed things you don't look at. If you don't open those boards, you don't seed them. Common misconception.\n\n>Sure, but that's like arguing you can filter people on 8chan. It's just placebo. It wouldn't be any difference if other boxes are seeding even if yours isn't, it would still show up on everybody's catalog until they manually mute thread by thread.\n8ch used a central server, so the same bandwidth was allocated to shit content as good content. That's where the vulnerability is with spamming. Zeronet relies on users to voluntarily seed content. That means expanding spam threads, for example, expanding spam images. This means that spam will get very little bandwidth and any seedboxes will be easily banned.\n\n>That's not how it works. I don't have your ID, yet I'm seeding your posts.\n>Whenever I switch IDs, my machine is still seeding the posts I made with the previous IDs.\nI think you're misunderstanding, or maybe I'm not phrasing it very well. Because content you publish relies on YOU to propagate it. Suppose you're a seedbox and spamming gore, for example. You post one thread, change IDs, and post another. Your old ID is no longer seeding that first thread -- your new ID is. If someone mutes your new ID, both threads are no longer seeded to that person. You cannot maintain two IDs simultaneously to seed bullshit. So there's always only ever one ID for someone to mute.\n\nThere's also no \"inadvertent\" seeding of content. They need to expand those gore images. They need to open that thread.\n\nInstead, what you end up with is a catalog with a lot of gore at the bottom of it, whose images you cannot load, never being bumped or seeded. It's a non-issue.",

Because hosting sites on zeronet is free, we can simply make another, parallel site, while not shutting the original down. $43,830 is now $87,660, because we could just return to the last one if they stopped spamming it. With each iteration, the bots are forced to seed the rest of the site's content because muting users means they're less effective. So they're literally paying for the deployment of hundreds, maybe thousands of these boards, which costs us nothing to make.\n\nSo how much? A million? If we make just 12 sites, we've exceeded their funding. A billion? That'll take a bit more effort at 115 sites. How many zeronet sites can you make in an hour? A black hawk helicopter costs 1.4 billion. That's 319 sites to meet the equivalent of shooting one of those down. Every year.
