			"body": "Do you have any regular prayers or times you pray and what do you think about when praying? I have found I struggle for words if I try to “wing it” and I really don’t know how to pray at all so I rely almost entirely on existing prayers. I don’t know how people are able to think of what to say all the time. I get intimidated when people ask me to pray for them as if I’m not eloquent enough.\n\nI pray “Lord I believe, help my unbelief” over and over as part of my daily prayers. I often think about the father in the Gospel where those words are found. He had imperfect faith but what he had was enough to seek Jesus out. Then I think about how dependent on God we are that we even need help to believe in his goodness. Another purpose is to ask God for the faith to mean all of my other prayers so that I’m not just reciting words to get them out of the way. Anyway I’m interested if other people here have certain thoughts or mental images when praying and what they are. They can be deliberate or involuntary.",
