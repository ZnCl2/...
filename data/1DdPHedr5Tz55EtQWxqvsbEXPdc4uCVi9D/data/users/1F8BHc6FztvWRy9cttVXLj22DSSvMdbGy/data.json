If you give youtube-dl the -F flag it will present you with a list of available audio/video quality options, from low-bit rate audio and video only, to the high quality options. Then you give youtube-dl the -f flag followed by the format code and download your file.\n\nMany “videos” are just audio only files with some dumb image slideshow on top, often the images don’t seem especially relevant to the video. For those the option to download audio files directly is great.",
