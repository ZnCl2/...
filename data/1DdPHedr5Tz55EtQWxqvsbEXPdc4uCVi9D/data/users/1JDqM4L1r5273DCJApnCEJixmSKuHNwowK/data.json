IT'S CALLED A USER ACCOUNT.\nYou don't even need to have a central administrator with a private key that allows him to update the site. If an update is available, it can be made a available to users by downloading the software manually just like they did for the initial install. This way everybody will gravitate towards the best client and not just the one a site owner is supplying by default. And sites would be able to have pretty much any feature they want and not just whatever ZeroNet allows them to do through its API.",
