But honestly if you're really scared of hosting illegal content then just use TOR+VPN and don't seed anything without personally browsing through it.",

So what? Remember that data is spread far and wide. I can change the ID as much as I want too. I can even delete my data folder  under the Zeronet install files, taking away the original seeds for the things I've posted.\nOf course this brings up the issue we'll have with old or unpopular content eventually being lost. But that's no different than rolling catalogs that cleared out old threads. We can still archive entire pages ourselves if we really want.\n\nSome anons have mentioned bulletproffing strategies like a virtual machine that is in deepfreeze. So every time you start the machine you get a clean slate with a Zeronet install exe on the desktop, then you can easily delete all evidence after you're done browsing. Of course you can't seed with this. But if clean browsing is what you're after, you can get it. There will hopefully be plenty of us that aren't doing illegal shit and can seed the site so it's usable. The entire 8chan userbase should be big enough to collectively host the site with good speeds.",
