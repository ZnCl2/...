Who did that???  Very fucking few.  Archive sites sprang up, and very useful & appreciated ones at that, but still not saved offline.  This site does that automatcally for every one of us.  Every peer has a copy of the text and the pics they viewed/seeded, and it can all be reviewed without a connection to the net.  They can't shut us all down...\n\nAs for the evil/bad content, MUTE it, and it will remove it from your machine...",

You can manage what is stored if you start looking in the data directory.  You can even identify an equivalent of an ID to tie a particular user's posts together (at least until a key change is made).\n\nZero has pluses:\nCan't be DDOS'd because there's no central site to attack, and it doesn't need DNS which would be another attack surface.\n\nText is archived automatically by virtue of the P2P structure.\n\nI don't buy into \"pressure\" of any kind.  Period.  Anons do what anons want.  As long as we cross post across the various bunkers, all is good.\n\nIf there's a Q sighting, word will spread...",

It has more power than anything (well almost).\n\nThat hash is basically the equivalent of the ID in 8chan except that it lasts until you change it instead of changing each bread/thread.\n\nSo what.\n\nIt's actually useful, and what would be nice is a mod that would show it on the board with each post so we can see easily which replies are posted by the same ID.  (We can look now in the data/1DdPHedr.../data/users/*/data.json file to see all posts by an ID.)\n\nChanging it is kind of equivalent to changing your IP (change vpn server) on 8chan to force a new ID except that it's now much easier to change here if/when needed.  Only shills had an (obvious) need to do that.\n\nUnless you have a reason to not want your multiple posts connected to the same user ID, then relax.\n\nMillion dollar question:\nWhy would the shills want you to change it with every post?????  And why do they?????\n\nEasy - because the filtering is by ID.  So if everyone changed their ID every time, no filtering would have any affect anymore.\n\nWe can be sent down path after path after path for all the wrong reasons...\n\nGod bless patriots.
