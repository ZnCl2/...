It doesn't matter what loophole you think you find in some obscure parts of the law, most of the people writing the laws don't even know what's in them.\n\nThe law is whatever the state tells you it is. If it's that you pay 50% income tax, pay speeding tickets or need to pay for permits, if you do not comply they will seize your property and put you in jail, and if you resist THEY WILL SHOOT YOU. That's the law. \n\nStupid faggots.",
