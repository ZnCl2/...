There where printscreens, alot of them, with a (you) behind it.\nWhat I found interesting, unless i remember wrong, is that they included ONLY screenshots from the original OP and then the posts in a complete other thread, it was the thread where supposedly in France some guys where shooting at drugsdealers?\nWhy did they not include the, at least, 5 replies to the original OP? Also, the printscreens I've seen circulating on 8ch after word got out FBI was investigating eveyone replying to that thread, I never saw any printscreen with the other replies (there were more then 5) I had a printscreen on my PC with atleast 7 replies.\nI wonder, if anyone of the people posting in OP, were also Feds",
