The torrent will be a magnet link, no .torrent files, because magnets can be built into the website's html and are reachable so long as a peer has the metadata, while a .torrent file is a fracture point\nFor instance doorcuck made a torrent with his shit, we'd use that torrent. Kiwifarms made a torrent of his stream and everyone is using it, so we use that torrent.  Tarrant's stream has a kiwifarms torrent, we'd link that. Tarrant's manifesto that I've seen has only been shared through filehost links, so we'd make a torrent of that.",
