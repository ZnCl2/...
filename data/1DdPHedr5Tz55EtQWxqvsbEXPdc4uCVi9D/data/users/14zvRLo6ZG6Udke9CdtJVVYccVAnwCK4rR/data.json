			"body": "I see a lot of people talking about practicing \"good opsec\". What do you consider \"good opsec\"? Using Tor? A VPN? You know many sites don't allow you to post or even browse the site with those, right? Does that mean it's impossible to practice \"good opsec\" in those sites?\nSorry but it annoys me when people think they'll be safe from prying eyes when using honeypots like 4chan just because they're practicing \"good opsec\". If Tor and even VPNs are banned on there, then what would be \"bad opsec\"? Signing every post with your full name and home address? Is \"good opsec\" thing some Qtard meme or something?",

Or do you think the probability of a VPN you pay 5 dollars for snitching on you to avoid being brought to court and having to pay tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers is lower than the probability of the 3 default Tor nodes being run by the government (or at least 2 and the third one being solved by traffic correlation)?",
