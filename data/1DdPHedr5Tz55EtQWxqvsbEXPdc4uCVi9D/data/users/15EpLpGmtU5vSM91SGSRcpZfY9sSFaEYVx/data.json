			"body": "In a land far and away by quite a distance and then some, in a time yet not come yet long gone, when the clover tree was rotted hollow and the figure eight garden had the clouds fallen to it, a strange little collection of anons caroused and made merry.\nLike their fathers and forefathers the anons of O'Aetland had made journey to their residence by forceful exodus. The first a purge of the weeaboos who cared not for taxes imposed unjustly, the second for moots persecution of the proclaimers of witches, and now here where men with iron were flagged in our old nations colour and so blame for their action became ours by public court. \nIn the time when the garden was just sprouting buds green, a knight of Acid and his cohorts drew plans then for case of their own downfall. The garden lay on tempestuous earth then as always, so the reclamation of new land was always prudent. Little did they imagine how long it would be for their opus to be unearthed.\nIn the year of our Lord MMXIX with no warning the clouds fell hard on the garden of Eightland. The cloud kingdom of google recalled their 'divine' protection under pretense of the anons having committed grievous sins. I need not go into details, but suffice to say it is a horsehockey excuse. The land was consumed by those forces innumerable immediately, the anons set adrift. By the score they remembered old infos, and dredged up pics dusty with bytes. The Acid knights small opus flooded as though an alluvial plain.\nWhat set this land apart from all before, at least until the old age of Yusenet, was that every anon who joined, who created, who viewed, grew the land by inches and feet. A land as close to the promised chan as the gods have permitted.\n\nLet us feast and make a merry meme as in times of yore, for anon was, is, and will be for ever the more. O'Aetland is our oasis in a darkened world, and our towers will be sturdier than any, that we can ''only'' stand tall.",
