I vaguely remember him pulling some shit back when he was the BO for whichever of the boards it was. I do remember /ggrevolt/ when it got really messy. Thinking back on it, I think that was around when GG started hitting on all the hard shit that really triggered the SHUT IT DOWN response. I wonder if it'd even be possible to get that shit past /pol/ nowadays.\n\nI wonder if pic related will post: \"Geopolitical Censorship, GamerGate and You\" in case it doesn't. I'm sure other anons have it.",
