I'll never leave you, never ever and you're all stuck with me forever in this limbo that is /v/ and you'll hear my endless rampant rancid rants about what the fuck is going on in the gookland, until the world crumbles down! Do you hear me? Ya'll all stuck with me forever! This is my home, and you are all my family.\nBy the way, isn't this bunker was originally setted up by Acid? I remember him making indestructible bunker around few years ago. If I remember correctly and Acid made this bunker, that means the Asukafag finally contributed something for the humanity.\n\nI'll be here for you forever. I neglected reporting lately, but I'll never leave you. And remember, traps are gay.\n\nI love you all.",
