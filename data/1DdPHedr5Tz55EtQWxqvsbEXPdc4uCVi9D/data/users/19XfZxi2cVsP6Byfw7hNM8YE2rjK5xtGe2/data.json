Too bad you have millions flooding in every year lol. How far can you realistically get with lone wolf attacks? A couple thousands per year if not less? Despite all the shitposting on 8/pol/ about wanting to kill jews, obviously not that many people are ready to die or rot in prison for a few minutes of fun and knowing there's a 0.00001% less chance of your granma being raped or whatever.\nIf you want to kill all jews and muds then you'll need to control the government to perform large scale deportation/genocide. And for that you would have to literally fight the US Army (even in Europe, because zogbots will deploy there if there's a large scale event). The US Army won't fight against genocidal maniacs trying to kill all jews? They did go against Hitler, what makes you think they won't do it against whoever tries it now?\nIf you choose to do terrorism then that terrorism should be to demand secession and subsequent consolidation of military power to fight a conventional (or even nuclear) war. Randomly killing a couple jews here and there won't do shit.",

Companies need financing, payment processors, hosting services, accounting, hiring and legal services, they need all kinds of shit. But especially financing and banking services in all of its forms.\nIf they get blacklisted by other companies run by jews (and companies that depend on companies run by jews) they won't get any of that, and they'll lose way more money than the couple buyers for their games and money they'll spend in random diversity shit they'll lose by cucking out.\nThe only way you can remain based without going broke is if you don't depend on any of that. Which basically means having less than 10 employees and not needing large amounts of money to run your ops, or having other companies as clients. Which is why you see a lot of explicitly right wing companies in the trades, because clients are unaware or just don't care, and they don't need other companies to lend money, buy their shit or perform services for them.",
