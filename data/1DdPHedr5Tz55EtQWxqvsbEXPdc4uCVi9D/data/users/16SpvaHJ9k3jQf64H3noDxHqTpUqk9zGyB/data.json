			"body": "How much of this is the public being put at risk so FBI can keep their jobs?\n\nThe FBI seems to have an uncanny talent for preying on the feeble minded and making sure their incoherent mumblings actually translate into concrete punishable acts. YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO LIVE IN AN AREA WITH AN FBI PRESENCE. ONE OF THESE DAYS THINGS WILL GO VERY BADLY FOR THE PUBLIC - AND THE FBI WILL COVER THEIR ASS. THESE MORONS ARE A MENACE.\n\nOn Friday, November 1, 2019, the FBI arrested a self-proclaimed white supremacist named Richard Holzer, who was allegedly planning to bomb Temple Emanuel in Pueblo, Colorado—the second-oldest synagogue in the state.\n\n    Southern Colorado Man Charged With Federal Hate Crime For Plotting To Blow Up Synagogue\n\n    Press release: https://t.co/8bFPqO1bct\n\n    Pictured: U.S. Attorney Jason Dunn, FBI SAC Dean Phillips & Pueblo Police Chief Troy Davenport addressing members of the media pic.twitter.com/nyJOy1he9z\n\n    — Colorado U.S. Attorney (@DCOnews) November 4, 2019\n\nThis is, largely, a good thing. After sleeping on the white supremacist infiltration of police departments all across the country, it's nice to see the FBI is actually taking action against this hugely dangerous epidemic. And there's absolutely no question that Richard Holzer was a white supremacist with violent intentions. As the Justice Department explained in a press release:\n\n    Holzer, who self-identifies as a skinhead and a white supremacist, told undercover FBI agents that he wanted to do something that would tell Jewish people in the community that they are not welcome in Pueblo, and they should leave or they will die. The affidavit states that during a meeting with the undercover agents, Holzer repeatedly expressed his hatred of Jewish people and his support for RAHOWA, shorthand for a racial holy war.\n\nHolzer also told the undercover FBI agents that he had already hired a \"witch doctor\" to \"hex and poison\" the water at the Temple, paying a Mexican cook to add arsenic into the pipes. It's unclear if this actually happened, or if it actually accomplished anything—but clearly, this guy was trouble. After befriending Holzer online, an undercover FBI agent actually went with him to case the Temple to plan for a potential attack. According to the affidavit, Holzer was the first one to bring up the idea to use Molotov Cocktails. He quickly realized that wouldn't be enough to do the damage that they wanted to. So naturally, the undercover FBI agent recommended using pipe bombs instead … which is how they managed to set up a sting operation to catch Holzer in the act of attempting to buy the pipe bombs that the undercover FBI agent offered to provide.\n\nHolzer faces one charge of \"attempting to obstruct persons in the enjoyment of their free exercise of religious beliefs, through force and the attempted use of explosives and fire,\" which is a federal hate crime.\n\nOn one hand, this is a plot reminiscent of the BlacKkKlansman story, complete with a team of undercover agents working to construct a whole elaborate personality. And they got the guy, so fuck yeah. On the other hand, the FBI has a long history of using these exact same tactics to entrap Muslim-Americans—even planting evidence and arresting them when they don't comply with the pressures of the undercover agents.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that white supremacy and violent anti-Semitism are absolutely on the rise right now. So it's not quite the same as authorities targeting Muslims and black people just because of some perceived risk of subversion—because they're part of a minority group that threatens the status quo, either by demanding fair treatment, or simply by existing. But it feels slightly gross and hypocritical to say, \"Well, I'm okay with these tactics this time because I think they did the right thing for the right reasons. I just don't like it every other time.\" Because that sets a dangerous precedent.",

On one hand, they do show corruption and blackmail at high levels. But I'm also quite tired of whores re-litigating their price. Especially when the indignant narration comes from a married/childless spinster:\n\nRobach became engaged to former Melrose Place star Andrew Shue in September 2009, after meeting him at a book party the previous April.[11][12] They were married on Robach's 37th birthday, February 6, 2010, at The Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers, adjacent to the Hudson River.[13] Robach has three stepsons from her marriage to Andrew Shue, Nate (1997) Aidan (1999) and Wyatt (2004).[9]\n\nAmy is not qualified to speak about procreation. And I'm pretty certain that she and her other MSM peers themselves whored at high levels for gain. Such people have no concept regarding the nitty gritty of creating replacements.\n\nEpstein never bought the cow. That's bad for our species. With his money, he could have married them in a polygamous friendly country and those girls would have had offspring. Important, because I sense their sour grapes is in fact really rooted in the reality of being Epstein's discards. And of course I would hope he would refrain from pimping his wives (shaking head- you never know with these guys)?\n\nIt's clear too many powerful people have complicated lives ...... And worse, EVERY MSM news presenter  or reporter you see is likely a freakshow. Why would ANYONE get their facts from people like this?\n\nAnd just fuck the royals! We fought a war to be rid of them. Who cares about inbred nothings? Ditto NYC. Petting zoo for freaks and criminals.",

Go ahead, make more forbidden.\n\n336\nPosted by\nu/Aurondarklord\nunwoke bluepilled shapeshifting MOD\n10 hours ago\nLooks like DevilHS has fired off another salvo in the war for artistic freedom on twitter\nTWITTER BS\n\nFollowing the latest dogpile by the \"WHERE ARE HER ORGANS!?\" crowd over a Captain Marvel lewd, the man who started it all by refusing to budge for the mob has waded into the fray once again:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/mr_devilhs/status/1193368028697772033\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PabloRomeroArt/status/1190777116364877825\n\nSo far, in what DevilHS accurately described as a war \"between erotic artists and crazy people\", it's looking like, to my incredibly relief, art twitter is not just refusing to bend the knee, but actively fighting back to trigger the tumblr refugees into submission before these people, WHO NEVER SEEM TO FUCKING LEARN, manage to turn their new platform into a puritanical circlejerk just like they did to their old one...and inevitably cause the same result, then once again scream and wonder why THEIR porn is being banned and not just porn for people they hate.\n\nI'm definitely starting to feel a change in the cultural winds here, more and more strongly. People are speaking up, fighting back, Get Woke Go Broke is working. But remember: any positive change we are seeing is the result of the fact SJWs promised companies a \"wider audience\" if they bent to their whims, and have failed to deliver it because they don't have the numbers, and they don't put their money where their mouths are. If we want to hang onto any gains we're making, we have to be better than that, we have to actually SUPPORT the people who give us what we want, buycotts are more effective than boycotts.\n\nOh and PS: To any lurking SJWs: NOW do you understand what it feels like to have a character you see as \"for you\" taken away and given to someone else? That rage you feel over fucking FANART that's not even canon, imagine how you'd feel if it were the company doing it to you. If, say, Disney actually redesigned Rey's outfit like DevilHS drew it, and either called Daisy Ridley in and told her \"it's current year and we're chasing a different demographic, so go get yourself a mega boob job and do a fuckton of squats\" or recast her. That's how it feels every time a character WE love gets censored or racebent or wokeified to appease you fucks. Sucks, doesn't it?",

Might make any Zeronet node on Tor truly hard to find.\n\nWould never go so far as to claim anything is buttsniffer proof - but Zeronet is a good effort.\n\nIt would be good if some really hardcore security types waded through Zeronet's code looking for mistakes, then after publishing developed a \"best practices\" tutorial for setting up truly bulletproof nodes.\n\nWe also need to get the EFF more sharply focused on the 4th amendment. It should be damn near impossible to enter homes, and judges should grant perhaps 3ea warrants per year. That would lift the threat of wingnut content being used as an excuse for seizing hardware.\n\nFailing changes in government overreach, the only solution remaining is hyperviolence. It should prey on the mind of any LE that they may not make it home given the abundance of examples where citizens fought to the death with tragic consequences.

I use the list of trackers found on the Syncronite zite on ZeroNet at this address: http://127.0.0.1:43110/15CEFKBRHFfAP9rmL6hhLmHoXrrgmw4B5o/ . This list is updated regularly, and it is much larger than the default list that comes with the ZeroNet software, so it will allow you to have a greater pool of peers with which to potentially connect. This will give you a more robust connection to the rest of the content on ZeroNet. To use this list, simply go to ZeroHello, Click on the three vertical dots near the upper left-hand corner, select \"configuration\", and in the \"Trackers\" box paste the link to a list of trackers that is found on Syncronite's main page.",

You open from the Red interface to the Red interface which lets your relay \"see\" the internet.\n\nOnce this is done, you need only set this box up on the DMZ of your present router. Alternately, you can replace your current router with this one. I've done it both ways. Each method has advantages.\n\nThe coder behind this box has released gooberisms, but he's also very conscientious and actually READS the Spectre CPU flaw papers so he can mitigate those flaws when possible.
