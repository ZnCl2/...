If the people don't feel incredible pride towards their country, they will support enriching themselves instead of enriching the country. If the people are split into many groups, racial/ethnic lines being the usual culprit, then they will desire to raise their own group ahead of the rest and vote accordingly. You don't need to have a lot of nationalism and homogeneity, just enough for population to consider themselves part of the nation first, and part of any other group second.\nIf you don't have those two things, then don't bother trying to implement democracy. It will fail, or will turn into a dictatorship with show elections. Democracy is not a cure-all like some people think it is. In fact, some modern democracies are actually proof of the situational value of dictatorships, since a wise dictator can build the nation to remove factional conflicts and create a sense of nationalism, and then turn the system into a democracy to allow his progress to stay without risk of an incompetent successor fucking it all up. Had they skipped the wise dictator and gone straight to elections, they would have instead gotten the most corrupt dictator.",

They don't have armored cars, they don't have security guards unless they are wealthy (and even then, the guards are only at the main estate and in public), their house probably has a burglar alarm that hasn't been tested since it was put in ten years ago. Marksmanship would expand your options, but you're talking about shooting people who can't shoot back, so why keep it a public affair at all?\nBack on 8/k/, there was a post where someone suggested that you break into people's homes while they sleep, assassinate them, I would add to steal hard drives and files while you're there, booby trap the doors, and leave, and then you just wait until some donut-muncher gets bombed investigating that guy who hasn't left his house for a week. Do that enough times, and they catch on to not come unprepared to strange cases of people sequestering themselves away. How much does it wear on the collective psyche that, in order to maintain order, your house will get smashed up by EoD techs because a neighbor didn't realize you were on two-week vacation? How seriously will people take it that, if you are anti-white, you may not wake up one morning and johnny lawman can't do shit about it? That method of attack takes only a week of prep and a suppressed pistol with minimal training, and some common sense about evidence.\nThis is actually a strategy that Israelis used to beat Palestinian terrorists for a while. If a terrorist leader was too effective, he would be tracked down individually and an attack helo would throw a hellfire missile at him. After the first dozen, the leadership structure was all newbies and retards, which is the kind of problem that destroys organizations permanently.",

This is why PO boxes exist. \nThat's not always possible though, so what happens if your address is already out there? If the enemy does decide to attack your house, then the best course of action is to have it mildly fortified. Doors that can't be picked but can be kicked, windows that can't be opened from the outside unless you break them, et cetera. If he can't get into your house, he will attack someone else's, so it is best that you stop him at yours, and set up for a 1v1. The goal is to wake you up so that you can fight back against the intruder. It's your house, so you know the best ambush points, what parts of the house sound like when they are walked on, what paths the intruder will take to get to another part of the house, and where the intruder's objective (you) is. It's an incredible advantage if you are awake to receive it. Against government forces, it's different, but in a one-on-one assassination battle, the best bodyguard available is always yourself.",

If you engage with him, it is only a matter of time before he gives you a bot test and refuses to engage back until you pass it, except the test is vague and has no discernible right answer. He will even refuse to share what the answer is supposed to be to prevent future AI from figuring it out (despite the fact that he thinks bot AI's are basically sentient, he also thinks they spend their time shilling on forums, the worst possible use of such technology), and as such he also is never able to display someone who passed it, which is why I say that there seems to be no right answer. Similarly obscure is his criteria for bot posts: he can always spot even the highest quality bots, but will never explain how he was able to do it. He is the most annoying and persistent shill that I've seen, and his presence kills every thread that it can. It would be worth it to throw away the bot threads if he went with them.\nOn the targeted bots shilling things on 4chan and similar, we've literally known about that for years. On most threads, there are chaff posts which you learn to glaze over because they have no relevance to the conversation and don't say anything remotely interesting, just 1 post from this ID talking about some bullshit. Those are everywhere, they just are most obvious on 4chan. I think that it's because the borders between topics are very definite, so it's a lot more obvious that the bots are just throwing shit out there to artificially inflate an opinion's following.\nAs for the minority hate threads, those are natural. Either that, or someone made a 4chan bot that can post threads at random intervals and keep them bumped but couldn't be bothered to give the bot enough material to keep it going for more than ten posts. Even then, those are where I got my start on this path all those years ago, so they seem a bit too useful for a shill thread.",
