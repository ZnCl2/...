Don't like a board? Don't join it. Don't like an image someone posted? Mute it. Problem solved.\n\n>slow and consume a lot of bandwidth\nIt works perfectly fine for me\n\n>clearly a honey pot\nOf course it is, accuse one of the few opensource alternatives we have. Good thing clearnet chans are totally not compromised, never cooperate with the authorities and hand over sensitive data.\n\n>You need to config a shit tons of shit just to lurk\nDownload a python script, configure it with tor and lurk ahead. If that's too complicated for you then maybe you should head back to reddit or wherever you came from ",

There's a ton of spam on /pol/ and the only way to get rid of it is to open each individual thread. Adding check boxes next to threads in the catalog so you can mute many at once would also be nice.",
