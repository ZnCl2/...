You do realise all the actual humans can just hop to another bunker like millchan itself or a millchan hub board. Allow posting anonymously with a millchan certificate generated per post that then can't be edited or signed again instead of signing a blockchain signature that is blocked from being signed by tor users.\n\nOh and while you are at it fucking delete yourself.\neditagain\nThe A.I kept posting even after you disabled millchan posting on the 9th you stupid faggot.

If I were trying to take down a website hosted via the zeronet software suite I have three options, end-run attacks, data in transit attacks, and stored data attacks. If I wanted to, as a glownig or artificial intelligence with access to microsoft/jewgle/gitlab SSL servers, I could fuck with the source code of zeronet to delete all instances of a website on startup or predefined time followed by fucking the users computer hardware over with various exploits and or a loader for future exploits as a rootkit. That would attack the data as it were stored, all millchan instances deleted and the code shoahed from gitlab/git center means bye bye zeronet for chans. Unless someone made a offline backup of zeronet and millchan stuff that would survive all of this and the glownig was incompetent and never found it in this proccess. Making everything he did for such, as vanity.\n\nThe next thing he could do instead of attack the data as it is stored is attack all unencrypted **and encrypted if snowden is to be believed** zeronet traffic with dedicated ASIC's at key tier one datacenter, i.e large CDN's where traffic is already copied and stored foreverish with dedicated hardware. By attack I mean modify the traffic to be meaningless or block it outright. You could also use this as a delivery mechanism for zeronet and javascript exploits if you wanted to start looking for hash collisions in SHA or whatever zeronet uses.\n\nThe third option is a endrun attack which is just a matter of identifying users using easily hacked versions of OS's like windows and ubuntu and hack them and delete everything or spy on them **even moreso** or whatnot. A lazy and stupid glownigger would just use the already in place system to attack users computers and identify key targets who contribute to the betterment of zeronet like HelloZeroNet on github or the millchan dev on gitlab. A extremely thorough and dedicated glownig would go with the source code exploit that then deletes everything, but they would wait until something important like cheese pizza related stuff pertaining to worldy evil wealthy people like clinton and trump came out on here.\n\nI believe the HelloZeroNet dev is already hacked or compromised because of fucking with the zeroID system and making it essentially closed source. Nothing much more will be done until (((someone))) is asshurt about something that could threaten their physical well being. Until then its mostly the same with the various artificial intelligences spamming stuff **like you about this place being unable to be taken down...** Now keep in mind that all of this is much harder for glownigs then spamming DCMA emails at 8ch or getting a kangaroo court and pony show setup for one man, like Jim of 8ch as is ongoing. Even if Jim isn't an agent of the cia its still easier to go down that route then have technical competence to subvert software such as zeronet or millchan, if even said software is dead fucking easy to subvert being made in python and javascript.\n\n**formatting is hard on a ever changing textbox**",

Software has been subverted at the source code before see the NSA SSL certificate backdoor in windows since XP days. For modern examples of anonymity software see bitmessage. You don't have to look far for such examples.\n\nIf you are talking about mass subversion of software for the deletion of something then yes see american patent trolls on DMCA'ing software constantly. Or see the dissappearence of the Julian Assange treasure trove and most of its archives, specifically most of the archives and all of the treasure trove is gone.\n>Were similar solutions used at some point in time?\nIf you are talking about software subversion the fix is a computer wipe followed by bugfix if its a simple backdoor like a SSL certificate tampering. But it varies based on how and what was done and by whom because of technical competence. It could be argued that nearly every computer that ever used zeronet is compromised because they turned on javascript to use zeronet which could have had a javascript exploit developed or held for the tor browser.\n\nI don't know if anyone saved anything related to the julian assange treasure trove but its almost certainly impossible to upload to anything besides something akin to a air gapped computer that only communicated via USB drive to another air gapped computer for technical reasons that are too long to explain in 5000 characters.\n>>9a37caf0-6db4-4a09-b4c7-b260f853adf3\n>python and javascript are safer\nHAHAHA nice joke. Javascript https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/14/aslr_busting_javascript_hack/ , and python https://whitehatck01.blogspot.com/2018/08/integer-overflow-vulnerability-in.html just as C++ are so utterly vulnerable to exploits. The reason I called out javascript is because its running untrusted/audited code over the internet in real time if you have it enabled. Now for zeronet examining it is as easy as enabling a debugger with javascript disabled on the zite you want to examine and reading the javascript. You can also see if any javascript or any file is being sent as an update in the tab you pull to the left in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nIs it better to edit posts close together to make a reply or make a second post? Which is faster? Which is better on disk space? Is a new content.json made for each edit or just a resigned certificate for the already made content.json?",

You see the bytecode goes like this\n>bytecode -> interpreter written in C -> assembly for hardware\nWhile the program, the interpreter itself goes like this\n>interpreter written in C -> assembly\nYou want to avoid non-bytecode as that is the slowest going something like this \n>UTF/ASCII encoded text -> bytecode -> interpreter written in C -> assembly\nI believe python offers an option to compile to bytecode to speed things up.

Is it so you can more readily impregnate females? Is it so you aren't so attracted to females **what kind of retard...** Really it just depends. I assume most on NOFAP are there because of peer pressure and guilt. Meanwhile most on the other side are just indifferent. Really what this comes down to is get a female and fuck her if you are so fucking horny.\n>>5070b283-6899-45b4-b333-ffd1ac2b0177\n>Why we don't have FAP board\nWhat would even be the objective of the board be? Talking about who can do it the most, waifus, and anoholes? **or whatever those things are called** Most of these things happen on porn dump boards or /b/. Why do you need another board for such?",

COBRA supports the concept of software bus running over a network interconnected machines. It provides transparent access to any software object (or service) connected to the bus and abstracts the notions of programming language (C++, Java, Python...) and operating systems (Linux, Windows...) using an interoperable protocol (IIOP)\n>TANGO hides the complexity of the underlying protocols to the programer, while adding specific control system features (alarms, events, logging, data archiving...).\nIts essentially the end all be all of backdoors and rootkits and is developed by the Chinese, russian, and american governments in collaberation with each other.

This prompted her to take an early retirement in 2013 and write full-time,cranking out a few romance novels, some children’s books and a mystery – in addition to her column\nHer blog has weird titles such as\n>THE KEYS AREN’T THE KEYS WITHOUT THE NAKED CARPET GUY WATCHING OVER US\n>WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A TELEVISION STAR IN THE FLORIDA KEYS\nAnd lovely quotes such as\n>By the end of the year, the noses are full of mosquito carcasses and one antler is almost always missing like a pair of undies after a wild night of partying\nShe also is used in the emails recomended by the main website for the pictures you needed to see at the top of post while checking the picture under the haloween blogpost here http://archivecaslytosk.onion/cjx2W .\nNow if you aren't convinced see here http://archivecaslytosk.onion/NPAYO for the videos of under the sea snorkling.\nSome weird shit has been going on in florida for a long time. The reason I post this here is because it wasn't going anywhere on millchan and I was under the impression that the bread topped with tomato barriers to entry related incidents weren't just teens and kids gettings done in by others for the intent of marriage and reproduction, but murder, rape, demonic rituals, menstealing which is to say theiving those children from their parents was the real intent of bread topped with tomato barriers to entry related incidents.",

Due to the specific language used for odd scenarios, I posted what I posted. **Who pays such obscene amounts of money for a hotel and then out of nowhere with no questions asked is told they can get a pizza delivered for lunch, but then is wrote that it can be \"brought\" at night instead. Its implied if its actually talking about a pizza from pizzahut you can eat that they would serve him a soiled pizza for it having sat out from lunch time which is rediculously bad service for wealthy clients paying such amounts of money for a stay. But why didn't she say \"make\" like as in cooking it instead? Because of all the wealth required and the cameras setup for the place it would make the perfect pizzagate tier recording studio for the rich and powerful such as the Trudeau's. On that subject why are any of them staying at such a overpriced hotel that has cameras on you in every area 24/7?** Still maybe its just fucking nothing but a shitty hotel and investigating this was a waste of time. But ad hominim is not a arguement.",

But the weird part is that when I resolve the IP adress via my dns resolver I get a entirely different IP http://archivecaslytosk.onion/D1f7t which is owned by vulture holdings LLC, a sham company made by the artificial intelligence for pwned/parked domains. So I am not actually sure what's going on here. But I can tell you that going to this adress which zeroID sends a request to https://zeroid.qc.to/ZeroID/request.php when requesting an ID is blocked from tor exit nodes with the fake error message\n>Error while during request: Forbidden Network almost full (9), please try again later.",
