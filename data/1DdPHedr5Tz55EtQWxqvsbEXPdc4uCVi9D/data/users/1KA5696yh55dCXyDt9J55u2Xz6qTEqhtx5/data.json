That way moderation can be done for free, but also doesn't become stifling and oppressive.\n\nImagine.\n\n>picking your mods from a list.\n>blacklisted post is still visible, but only barely - shoved off, out of the way, to the margins, shrunk down to almost nothing, and merged with consecutive blacklisted posts.\n>Thumbnail is 50 pixels wide.\n>Modmode, wherein blacklisting a post takes only one click, and it's easy.\n>You can see which moderator snuffed what post.\n\nSorry if this turns out to be a duplicate post.
