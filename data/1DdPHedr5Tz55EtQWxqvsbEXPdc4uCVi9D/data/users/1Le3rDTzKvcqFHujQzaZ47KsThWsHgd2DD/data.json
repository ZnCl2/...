Every site distribution would bundle its own p2p software backend.\nAnd for any given site, people would make custom distributions that add their own custom features. There wouldn't be a \"default\" site. All the users of the site would access and modify the same data, but the software to access and modify that data would be what each user chooses to install rather than everybody installing a generic software like ZeroNet and then having every site deliver site-specific software automatically when accessing the site's URL.",
