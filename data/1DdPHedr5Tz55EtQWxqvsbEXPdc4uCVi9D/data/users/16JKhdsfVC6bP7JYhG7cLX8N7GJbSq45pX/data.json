So when you add all these difficulties up - 08chan may be an impossible objective for many.\n\nThere is also a very hard 5GB limit for posting. Beyond 5GB - postings won't sign. So they'll never appear on 08 chan at all. The solution to this is likely simple - just start a new \"posting container\". But if you don't know this limitation (and it's not in the Docs), it can bite pretty hard.\n\nI doubt this affects simple \"seeders\". Those who setup machines just to insure Zeronet stays open. This limit likely affects posters only.\n\nSo I would suggest that your idea of new users making use of proxies is not viable. Those proxies would hit this limit fairly quickly.\n\nI think you must accept that Zeronet and 08 chan are now and will always be under attack by misguided \"dogooders\" .  The current ZeroID system just invites mischief from such people. Although I can't imagine any alternative to your current system - you must find one.",

One for passive seeding (never any posting). This machine could be old and not very powerful.\n\nFor posting, you do need some CPU grunt - since it's generating all those file hashes.\n\nSome will whine about this suggestion. But that's the price for freeing yourself from censors. Censors don't want you to exist at all.\n\nZeronet is a well thought out system, but it needs more acceptance of it's limitations and quirks.

You’d think that the failure of Mr. Mueller’s extravaganza might have chastened them just a little — a $32 million-dollar effort starring the most vicious partisan lawyers inside-the-Beltway, 2,800 subpoenas issued over two years, 500 search warrants exercised, and finally nothing whatever to pin on Mr. Trump — except the contra-legal assertion that now he must prove his innocence.\n\nWhen you state just that, these frothing hysterics reply that many background figures — if not the Golden Golem of Greatness himself — were indicted and convicted of crimes by Mr. Mueller’s crew. Oh yes! The Russian troll farm called the Internet Research Agency was indicted for spending $400,000 on Facebook ads (and never extradited or tried in a court-of-law). Pretty impressive victory there! The hacking of Hillary Clinton’s emails by “Russia”? Still just alleged, never proven, with plenty of shady business around the search for evidence. Paul Manafort, on tax evasion of money earned in Ukraine, 2014? We’ll see about that as the whole filthy business of the 2014 Ukraine regime change op under Mr. Obama gets reviewed in the months ahead. George Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI? Stand by on that one, too; still a developing story. General Michael Flynn, for ditto? You may have noticed that General Flynn’s case is shaping up to be the biggest instance of prosecutorial misconduct since the Dreyfus affair (France, 1894-1906, which badly-educated Americans most certainly know nothing about).\n\nTo set the record straight I’m forced to repeat something that these New Age Jacobins seem unable to process: you don’t have to be a Trump cheerleader to be revolted by the behavior of his antagonists, which is a stunning spectacle of bad faith, dishonesty, incompetence, and malice — and is surely way more toxic to the American project than anything the president has done. Every time I entertain the complaints of these angry auditors, I’m forced to remind myself that these are the same people who think that “inclusion” means shutting down free speech, who believe that the US should not have borders, who promote transsexual reading hours in the grammar schools, and who fiercely desire to start a war with Russia.\n\nThat’s not a polity I want to be associated with and until it screws its head back on, I will remain the enemy of it. In fact, in early November I’m traveling to New York City, where the Jacobin city council has just made it a crime to utter the phrase illegal alien in a public place, with a $250,000 penalty attached. I challenge their agents to meet me in Penn Station and arrest me when I go to the information kiosk and inquire if they know what is the best place in midtown Manhattan to meet illegal aliens.\n\nThe volume of Jacobin hysteria ratcheted up to “11” late last week when the news broke that the Attorney General’s study of RussiaGate’s origins was upgraded to a criminal investigation, and that a voluminous report from the DOJ Inspector General is also about to be released. What do you suppose they’re worried about? Naturally the Jacobins’ bulletin board, a.k.a The New York Times, fired a salvo denouncing William Barr — so expect his reputation to be the next battle zone for these ever more desperate fanatics. Talk of preemptively impeaching him is already crackling through the Twitter channels. That will be an excellent sideshow.\n\nMeanwhile, how is Rep, Adam Schiff’s secret proceeding going? Last week he put out a narrative that US Chargé d’Affaires to Ukraine Bill Taylor fired a gun-that-smoked fer sure in testimony. Except, of course, as per Mr. Schiff’s usual practice, he refused to issue any actual transcript of the interview in evidence, while there are plenty of indications that Mr. Taylor’s second-hand gossip was roundly refuted under counter-questioning by the non-Jacobin minority members of the House intel Committee. Mr. Schiff’s pattern lo these many months of strife has been to claim ultimate proof of wrongdoing only to have it blow up in his face. It’s a face that many Americans are sick of seeing and hearing from, and I am serenely confident that before this colossal scandal is resolved, the Congressman from Hollywood will be fatally disgraced, as was his role-model, Senator Joseph McCarthy, before him.",

			"body": "(Deplatforming is for little people)\n\nOn Saturday night, in Davis County, Utah, a man was arrested for the alleged murder of his mother. The man additionally broadcasted three videos on Facebook showing the deceased.\n\nIronically, it's often alternative platforms that get targeted and deplatformed by media for their content issues – when it's Facebook that has been hosting the vast majority of illegal and violent content.\n\nThe live streams of murders and violence online have recently become a recurring phenomenon. Beyond the already heinous act of the crime, many murderers are publicly showing their actions, which puts platforms between the sword and the wall as they do not have a capable way to prevent this material from being broadcast.\n\nBetween drugs and the internet\n\nThe most recent case is that of Jeffrey Antonio Langford Jr., a 24-year-old man who is being accused of first-degree murder, obstruction of police work, and possession of dangerous weapons while handling substances such as drugs or alcohol. The victim was the mother of the accused, Graciela Laura Holker, 45.\n\nLangford made public a series of videos on Facebook where he shows the mother's body, and where he repeatedly indicates that he had nothing to do with her death, that she committed suicide, and that therefore he should not go to jail.\n\nSuicide or murder?\n\nWhen the officers arrived at the abode, they found Langford with bloodstains and not very sober. The doctors who interviewed him later indicated that he was intoxicated. During his medical examination, the man said he had witnessed his mother shooting herself in the face.\n\nRegarding the live videos: in the first one, Langford is seen with the body of his mother. In the second, the man indicates that she shot herself but that she was not yet dead and he was going to finish the job, and finally in the third video he says wishes to remember his mother with honor.\n\nHe also told police she had first slit her throat with a knife and then said she had shot herself three times, documents state.\n\nThe coroners also indicated that the position in which they found the weapon does not seem to coincide with a suicide.\n\nThis news occurs just after Facebook announced an alliance with London police to develop software that detects transmissions and videos that could contain violent acts – although, that is tailored towards terrorist incidents, and is not going to deal with the wider issue.\n\nhttps://reclaimthenet.org/8chan-8kun-deplatforming-censorship/",

			"subject": "Now even the Census Bureau wants to tackle online “misinformation”",
			"body": "(it's tyranny to count foreigners as citizens while allocating political power. The old 3/5ths rule)\n\nIt's not fake news: the US Census Bureau is worried that “online misinformation” might end up the country's 2020 census results, and is for that reason joining the ranks of those who have made it their business to fight “trolls and foreign governments” wreaking havoc on the internet.\n\nThe question, however, quickly becomes what interest “trolls and foreign governments” have in influencing the results of a US census – and equally importantly, how that can be achieved by means of online misinformation. The AP says that “the stakes are huge” and suggests that the motive would be to “undermine democracy.”\n\nThe way of doing this, meanwhile, would be by using social media giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter “to discourage people from participating in the census, either for political reasons or to game the allocation of resources.”\n\nAnd you won't be surprised to learn at whom the finger's pointed: “Russia and China as well as domestic operators,” said Dipayan Ghosh, of the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nThe AP report notes that “fake posts about the census began popping up days after the US Supreme Court ruled in June that the Trump administration could not ask about citizenship status on the 2020 census.” This question, it is suggested, might discourage people from participating.\n\nThis is the first time in its 230 years of history that the Census Bureau has felt that fake news have the power to influence the census results – but how exactly will the institution fight these powerful foreign forces, aided by “domestic operators”?\n\nThe Bureau is teaming up with Facebook, Google, and Twitter and working with them directly, the report explains.\n\nThe goal is “to help inform people about the mechanics of the census and to stamp out inaccurate information that's swirling around.”\n\n“We can communicate with them quickly and try to resolve, whether it's on public forums or in closed groups,” Bureau's Zack Schwartz revealed.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg probably had little choice but to agree that this is a real problem, and he intends to be solving it the same way his company is trying to solve any moderation and/or censorship puzzle: by combining algorithms with human moderators to detect unwanted content and block it.\n\nTwitter plans to do the same, while the Bureau will work with Apple and Amazon to include its messages in the questions-and-answers format in these companies' voice assistants, Alexa and Siri.\n\nBut, the report concedes, all this is going to be a challenge. “Closed sites,” i.e., private groups such as those on Facebook represent one, and another is the inability to control people in such a way that would stop them from sharing content they want to share – even if they've been told that it's fake.",

			"body": "(when you don't pay YOU are the product)\n\nStartpage.com, a search engine that has been billing itself for a long time as an alternative aiming to trump the dominant market forces on the internet by providing a counter-balance to the all present, privacy-invading mainstream options, is now being part-acquired by System1.\n\nSystem1 is an advertising company – a keyword pay-per-click advertising company, to be more precise.\n\n“One of Startpage's key differentiators from other private search engines is that we partner with Google for our results,” the company said while announcing the takeover.\n\nMore specifically, it is Privacy One Group Ltd. that has invested in Startpage.com – and their business relationship goes back to January 2019.\n\n“Privacy One Group is a separate operating unit of System1, focused entirely on user privacy,” the blog post said.\n\nIf you weren't sure what to make of that, there's this bit from the blog post:\n\n“We know you want to spend less time searching, and more time finding.”\n\nLong story short – an advertising company with a separate operating unit now owns an apparently strongly privacy-focused search engine that partners with Google. And if you spend a lot of your time “searching” – wouldn't it be great to instead be “finding.”\n\nBut Startpage spends no more effort addressing this collection of potentially life-changing or at least life-affecting assertions, as far as any journalist, researcher, or anybody else who spends a lot of time searching in the hope of finding may be concerned. Instead, it's mostly PR copy from here on – Startpage announces it will “continue to be headquartered and operated in the Netherlands” – and that fact alone apparently “ensures all of our users worldwide are protected by Dutch and EU privacy laws.”\n\nBut are they really? There have recently been major questions raised concerning some of the world's biggest social media/tech giants, specifically in terms of the reach national jurisdictions have over them when it comes to protecting, or indeed, policing data and content.\n\nStartpage's mission statement has been to differentiate itself from every another search engine “community” by focusing on user privacy. That meant storing no “personal data: no IP addresses, no personal user data, no search history, no tracking cookies.”\n\nIf you put your faith in this proprietary solution, the company informed you that while other search engines protections end “once you click to another website” – Startpage's proprietary sauce promises to make sure users can continue to browse in private “by viewing websites linked from Startpage's search results with true privacy for as long as they like.”\n\nJudging by the announcement, Startpage has had “a fascinating story and a long operating history” that begun in the late 1990s – to then resurrect in 2017 after merging with Ixquick.\n\nIt was certainly a good time to cite privacy as a selling point for a search company – but it's now 2019, and the outcome seems to be that of a boutique privacy search engine acquired by a pay-per-click ad outfit.",

McSwain announced that Fred Arena, 41, of Salem, New Jersey was arrested this morning and charged by Indictment with making false statements to government agents. The Indictment alleges that the defendant, who is an employee at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and as such is required to obtain a security clearance, lied to obtain the clearance. He also subsequently lied to federal investigators who asked him about his answers to questions on the security clearance paperwork.\n\nAccording to the Indictment, on January 10, 2019, Arena completed the standard Form SF-86 to obtain a security clearance for his employment. On that form, he was required to disclose whether he had ever been a member of an organization that used, or advocated the use of, force or violence to prevent others from exercising their constitutional rights. He falsely answered that he had not. In fact, Arena was an avowed member of Vanguard America, a white supremacist group that fits that description. On the same application, Arena was asked whether he had property repossessed within the past seven years. He falsely answered that he had not. In fact, Arena had previously defaulted on a car loan, and his car was repossessed within the seven year window.\n\n“Lying on federal security clearance forms and to government agents will land you in big trouble,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “Further, the nature of the defendant’s alleged lies – attempting to conceal his affiliation with a white supremacist group in order to obtain federal employment – is extremely disturbing. I want to thank all of our law enforcement partners in New Jersey and Pennsylvania for their excellent work on this investigation.”\n\n“Members of groups that sponsor hate and bias-motivated violence have no place in government employment,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Craig Carpenito. “Knowing this, the defendant in this case, a New Jersey resident, lied to conceal his membership in a white supremacist organization. We are proud to join our colleagues from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in prosecuting him for those lies.”\n\n“Membership in a group espousing extremist ideology is not itself illegal — but lying to the FBI is,” said Michael T. Harpster, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Philadelphia Division. “If the people we interview feel they can deceive us with impunity, critical investigations will be compromised, threatening the very integrity of the justice system. Arena lied about his history in order to obtain a security clearance he should not have had, and he lied to federal agents questioning him. These charges are the consequences of his actions.”\n\nIf convicted, the defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment, three years’ supervised release, and a $1,250,000 fine.\n\nThe case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation – Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Gloucester County Prosecutor’s Office, the Salem County Prosecutor’s Office, the New Jersey State Police and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), with assistance from the Philadelphia Police Department, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Joseph LaBar and Assistant United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey Martha Nye.\n\nAn indictment, information, or criminal complaint is an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.",

We’re lucky to have Tamas Kocsis work on this idea at all. It’s time to recognize just how dependent all of us are on his good graces. Consider for a moment if he tired of the whole enterprise and just walked away?\n\nAnd let’s lower our expectations a little. If Zeronet protects your identity and prevents changes to anything you post – do you really have any beef with these people over usability? I mean, do you really want scarce expertise focused on sniglets or keeping you safe? Also, consider for a moment the traditional life cycle of ALL software. Ie “Feature bloat into oblivion”. Do you really NEED emogie and rich text support?\n\nMost of the software you now own is shit for being “improved” too much ….Let's resist turning Zeronet into a turdcicle.",

			"body": "Frederick Brennan included.\n\nThe family of one of the 22 victims of the August 3rd, 2019 El Paso shooting has filed a lawsuit against not only the suspect of the shooting but also against 8chan – the website that the suspect posted his manifesto to – and Cloudflare, a security company that protected 8chan (and millions of other websites) from online cyber attacks.\n\nAccording to El Paso lawyer James Scherr, who is representing the family of Angelina Englisbee, 86, it's the first lawsuit related to the incident.\n\n“The family seeks this lawsuit to stop the hate, to send a message to people who are going to travel 600 miles or 1 mile to injure, maim or kill someone because of their national origin, their background, their religion, whatever the case may be, just because they live hate,” Scherr said in a press conference.\n\nThe suit specifically singles out three individuals and companies associated with 8chan as being somehow responsible for the El Paso terrorist's killing spree.\n\nThese individuals include Jim Watkins, who is the executive of the company that runs 8chan, Matthew Prince, the co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare; and Frederick Brennan – the original founder of 8chan, but who has since parted ways with the company and has been campaigning for the website to be take offline.\n\nThe suit claims that Patrick Crusius (the alleged shooter), Brennan, Watkins, Prince and Cloudflare “publically [sic] and privately encouraged, promoted, incited, encouraged and inspired ‘white racist nationalism', ‘nationalism', ‘Nazism', and ideological racist fervor, as an unincorporated association, to unite together to fight this ‘invasion' of minorities, particularly persons of Hispanic descent.”\n\nEl Paso police say that Crusius posted a hateful manifesto to 8chan at 10.15 am on August 3rd – and, while according to Jim Watkins it was promptly removed – the message board site remained associated with the incident and resulted in a media campaign to get the website shut down.\n\nAfter the incident, Watkins was invited to defend 8chan in Congress.\n\n“My company takes a firm stand with helping law enforcement and within minutes of these two tragedies, we were working with FBI agents to find out what information we could to help in their investigations,” Watkins said, after 8chan became the center of a media storm by association. “Our company has always worked with law enforcement to help them with their investigations. We have never protected illegal speech as it seems that we have been accused by some less-than-credible journalists.”\n\nScherr said he anticipates subpoenaing 8chan for evidence.\n\nWhile the suit is looking for a jury trial to determine whether the defendants are liable for damages amounting to more than $1 million, Scherr suggests that the case is not one the Englisbee family is “looking at trying to settle or get money out of.”\n\n“We're trying to set a new standard that those people can lose everything financially they have that is attachable to them by law if they are going to do this type of activity,” the lawyer for the family said.\n\nThis also includes even the families of mass shooters he said, noting “many times, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.”\n\nThe suit casts an even wider net and claims Crusius' parents and grandparents, with whom he was living at the time of the shooting, were also negligent “in fostering an environment which encouraged hate crimes” and “in allowing weapons in the home where Crusius resides, despite knowing of his dangerous propensities.”\n\nWhile the broadcasting of horrific incidents is an increasing trend online, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has protected platforms and service providers from liability when it comes to lawsuits such as these.\n\nEven Facebook and Twitch – which have previously streamed terrorist incidents live – have fallen short of being somehow blamed for the actions of the individual that perpetrated the attacks.\nhttps://reclaimthenet.org/el-paso-shooting-lawsuit-8chan-cloudflare/",

Exceptions exist only for exigent circumstances, including an immediate need to address a medical issue or a belief that the child is at risk of harm if the interview or exam is not completed.”\n\nIn fact, the police department’s own guidelines explain that what these officers did was wrong.\n\nTheir guidelines on suspected child abuse cases say: “An officer should not detain a child involuntarily who is suspected of being a victim of child abuse solely for the purpose of an interview or physical exam without the consent of a parent or guardian.” “Child victims should not be interviewed in the home.” And “officers should defer interviews until a person who is specially trained in such interviews is available.”\n\nAll three of these guidelines were broken, according to the lawsuit.",

But then she thought, “Wait, actually, that’s kind of fucked up because he’s the most interesting person I’ve come across, shouldn’t I be open to talking to him?” After dispelling her initial fear, she texted him that it would be “interesting (progressive? Powerful?) for two people who might be the antithesis of each other to go on a Tinder date.”\n\nNot having known conservatives before, Sulkowicz had to play catch up. Early in their friendship, she asked him to recommend one book to help her understand him, and he picked Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind. It’s a book that explains, in evolutionary terms, the human tendency toward political tribalism and the importance, in light of that, of learning from one another’s beliefs. She calls the book “mind-opening.” Its resonance with her new friendship did not escape her.\n\nShortly after, Sulkowicz attended a book talk of Haidt’s. This was for The Coddling of the American Mind, which diagnoses the campus left with the kinds of cognitive distortions that addle the chronically anxious and depressed: a tendency to blow everyday problems out of proportion,\n\nEven the alphabet people are beginning to have doubts about political correctness.\n\nGood",

Can I borrow some duck tape from someone.\n\n    — LoveToFlash (@LoveToFlash) October 30, 2019\n\nAnother person pointed to the apparent double standard when it comes to Democratic candidates' criticism of this Facebook ad policy and their relative silence on broadcast TV stations which have run uncensored political ads for more than a decade.\n\n    What I don't understand is why is it okay for TV stations to run lying political attack ads back-to-back-to-back for over a decade and suddenly this interest in Zuckerberg. Bit of a double standard it seems.\n\n    — JUSTICE FOR ALL!

During his recent testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, Zuckerberg told Congresswoman Maxine Waters:\n\n    “Our policy is we do not fact check politicians’ speech, and the reason for that is that we believe that in a democracy it is important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying. Political speech is some of the most scrutinized speech already in the world.”\n\nDuring the same hearing, Zuckerberg also told Ocasio-Cortez that it’s not right for Facebook to prevent constituents from seeing when politicians lie.",

			"body": "Twitter will ban all political ads, from every country, starting November 22nd, according to tweets by the company’s CEO Jack Dorsey today.\n\nThe changes will affect adverts from political candidates, as well as those running ads based on political issues. However, those running ads encouraging people to vote will still be allowed.\n\nThe full details of the changes will be made on November 15th, according to Dorsey.\n\nFrom Jack Dorsey:\n\n    “We’ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons…🧵\n\n    A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\n\n    While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\n\n    Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\n\n    These challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings. Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility.\n\n    For instance, it‘s not credible for us to say: “We’re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad…well…they can say whatever they want! 😉”\n\n    We considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn’t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too.\n\n    We’re well aware we‘re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.\n\n    In addition, we need more forward-looking political ad regulation (very difficult to do). Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough. The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.\n\n    We’ll share the final policy by 11/15, including a few exceptions (ads in support of voter registration will still be allowed, for instance). We’ll start enforcing our new policy on 11/22 to provide current advertisers a notice period before this change goes into effect.\n\n    A final note. This isn’t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It’s worth stepping back in order to address.”\n\nThe company’s decision comes after weeks of Facebook facing criticism from Democrats  such as Alexandrea Ocasio-Cortez and Hillary Clinton calling on Facebook to censor specific political ads. Dorsey seems to have ended the debate for Twitter by just switching them all off.",

People who you are fighting may love their kids and, you know, share certain things with you.”\n\n“That is not activism,” he concluded. “That is not bringing about change.

			"body": "31 October 2019 at 1:40 am\t\n\n\nA huge influx of money from the ROW into companies like Google, Faceplant, Apple, etc. that keeps the place funded. Lots and lots of OPM (Other Peoples Money) in play.\n\nOne of my kids just got a job at one of the big tech companies (the other one has had one for a while now). They can suck down huge money because their products sell globally without much effective competition.\n\nWHEN, and it is a when, that eventually falters, the place will stove in… Think of Venezuela under Chavez in the early years. Lots and Lots of oil money to keep the Socialism afloat coming from all over the planet. Only when the oil money started to dry up (post “nationalizing” it) as the infrastructure decayed; then the rot showed.\n\nFor California, the process is more complicated. Movies in the LA area are a global money draw. Yet a lot more production is happening outside the area… and for Silicon Valley, competitors are popping up all over. Where, 20 years ago, I did a lot of data center builds, now the big thing is remote data centers in cheaper places. “The Cloud”. Very little interest in building data centers with $0.35 / kW-hr electricity that might or might not be there when needed (electricity and communications are THE two biggest issues in a data center). So you see them being built in places like the Carolinas and Texas. Fab of semiconductors was a really big thing here in the ’80s. Now it’s all gone to Asia & similar. Folks only put “headquarters” and maybe engineering here now. High end folks who get paid high wages, but no worker bees…\n\nSo how much of that can you do? When does that hit the wall? I don’t know. Folks really like the wonderful climate and the “amenities”, so pay up for it. California has always banked on “The Next Gold Rush” and I’ve seen a couple of them come and go. What’s the next one? Will it fail this time? Hasn’t yet…. “So far so good.. this jumping off buildings isn’t so bad!” as we pass the 2nd floor headed toward the cement….\n\nWhere it bites is folks out in the countryside. They have “real jobs” and that’s where I see things degrading. Lots of little “Valley Towns” that are transforming into Mexican Barrios. My home town that was a great place All American Wholesome now is not a place I’d feel safe and shows signs of money stress…. So watch the rural California for decay as San Francisco / L.A. / Silicon Valley will be supported by OPM a lot longer…",

Chinese dictator Xi, Jinping stated during the parade, “No force can shake the position of our country, and no force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation’s steps.” The comments came alongside declarations that the authoritarian Communist state wanted to unite mainland China with Hong Kong and Taiwan ‘peacefully’.\n\nBut being the 70th Anniversary of the establishment of modern China, Big Kooka is tracing the history of the Communist Chinese superstate from its bloody origins in the 1930s to its Orwellian super surveilled current day.",

That's what Tor does - it changes your effective address.\n\nEx: Your real address would be 165.218.123.5\n       The Zeronet seeder would be 189.265.925.2\n       Your Z posting machine address would be 65.289.621.3\n\nEven more possibilities if you connect your Tor circuit through a VPN.\n\nAnd if Zeronet really is using Tor hidden services instead of exit nodes - Everything goes through 6ea IP addresses before reaching you. Three on your peer server, three on yours.\n\nThe word on the street is that Tor is pretty secure. It's the crap connecting to it that has flaws (browsers, Zeronet servers, etc). So if Zeronet is secure...using \"outsourcing\" to Tor for location fuzzing won't compromise it.\n\nEdit: Using Zeronet isn't dangerous as long as no flaws exist in the software. You might be able to build extra fallback protection by using a VPN with a \"Network Lock\". So that even if Zeronet was compromised - the attacker would get only the VPN address. Perhaps going from 99.9% protection to 99.999999%. And don't forget, you obtained your ZeroID through Tor. Should be nothing there to connect you - excepting a sloppy slip. Sloppy slips will always be a problem for secure network users. Another reason to change your identity frequently I guess.\n\nThe newsies don't understand this system - so tend to sell chicken little stories. Gets people's attention whereas \"Zeronet works\" would not.\n\nBEST protection would be every citizen owning a node. It would be like every citizen being armed.",

			"subject": "Boobs are good",
			"body": "and so the historical revisionism has begun again. The new narrative: \"We socially aware people never objected to boobs in games, we never called for sexual content to be removed and just wanted our own space in gaming and no-one ever tried to say you lot are bad for liking boobs in games\"\n\nThought I'd mention this as I've been seeing this narrative passed round a lot among certain SJW types.\n\nIt's once again them going \"The Gamers are lying but we are telling the truth don't trust those toxic lying gamers\". pretty much.\n\nHere's the problem\n\nAnita herself did say she wanted this stuff censored by the industry adopting \"Moral restrictions\" on what can be in games.\n\nhttp://archive.fo/mYiGp#selection-381.0-381.506\n\n    After a brief pause and a laugh, Sarkeesian responded: “I would love for companies to have moral restrictions, but they don’t.” She then dove into a multitude of examples of games or movies wherein female characters are used only as devices to show how depraved a male character is, citing specifically Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood and the Grand Theft Auto series. “Video games are an art form, but they’re made by corporations, and corporations aim to make money,” she explained, noting a corporate flaw.\n\nOh and also Anita did try to imply playing games with hypersexualised content are part of the reason rape hasn't been stopped from happening in the world.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/d1fPRKO\n\n(it won't archive because it's in a drop down section on the site)\n\nNow unless I'm very much mistaken calling some-one a rape apologist is calling them bad people unless being a rape apologist is now a good thing according to SJW?\n\nOh and as for \"We don't want to take your games away we just wanted our own space\"\n\nFrom Laurie Penny\n\nhttps://archive.fo/aUIHG\n\n    The problem is that women are creating culture, changing culture, redefining culture, and those cunts, those poisonous cunts, those disgusting, uppity cunts must be stopped.\n\n.....\n\n    They can’t understand why, just for example, when my friend, the games critic and consultant Leigh Alexander, was abused and ‘called out’ as an unprofessional slut, a lying cunt, morally and personally corrupt, just for speaking truthfully and beautifully about all of this, it was Alexander who was invited to write her first piece for Time magazine, Alexander who got to define the agenda for the mainstream, who received praise and recognition, whilst her abusers’ words will be lost in a howling vortex of comment threads and subreddits and, eventually, forgotten.\n\n.......\n\n    This is a culture war. The right side is winning, at great cost. At great personal costs to people like Anita Sarkeesian, Leigh Alexander, Zoe Quinn and even Jennifer Lawrence, and countless others who are on the frontlines of creating new worlds for women, for girls, for everyone who believes that stories matter and there are too many still untold. We are winning. We are winning because we are more resourceful, more compassionate, more culturally aware. We’re winning because we know what it’s like to fight through adversity, through shame and pain and constant reminders of our own worthlessness, and come up punching. We know we’re winning because the terrified rage of a million mouthbreathing manchild misogynists is thick as nerve gas in the air right now.\n\nThis is a culture war to them. The pieces of media and franchises just land to them in some stupid fight to redefine the world and remake it by trying to take control of media.\n\nHow many people online were on about things like \"It's our franchise now\" or \"Cry more it's ours now pissbaby\" ?\n\nIt's clear something is happening with SJWs. Maybe the long line of things getting Woke and going broke is finally catching up?\n\nMaybe they can feel the tide shifting against them?\n\nThere's been plenty of (mostly) gay muscle furries posting how they \"fixed\" a companies \"gross\" character deign and the company should hire them for turning the characters into either short haired butch lesbian stereotypes or making sure as much of the characters skin is covered as they can get to make them look close to Victorian \"decency\" standards.\n\nBut Hilariously they're still trying to rewrite the narrative that no SJW has objected to Boobs or Bayonatte or tried to push for things to be censored.\n\nDunno why this is happening or where the narrative and attempt to re-write history is coming from but I've been seeing it a lot among SJW types for about the past week or so. Anyone have any idea why now it's started?",

			"body": "-------- Forwarded Message --------\nSubject: \tHalloween is Over and the Jig is up\nDate: \tFri, 01 Nov 2019 14:12:17 +0000\nFrom: \tJames Howard Kunstler <>\n\n\n \n\nAnd so Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff take the Republic into a dangerous defile on a dark day as they engineer a House resolution with rules for a medieval-style inquiry on the existence of phantoms. The phantom du jour, of course, is the fabled “whistleblower,” a CIA ectoplasm identified by everybody and his uncle in Swampland as one Eric Ciarmarella, 33, a former Joe Biden staffer, Obama White House low-level NSC holdover, and John Brennan “asset” deeply involved in Ukrainian pranks during the 2016 election and subsequent disinformation leakage to the media since the early days of the Trump administration.\n\n     The “whistleblower’s” trail winds through every shadowy turn of RussiaGate to the current phantasmagoria of UkraineGate, and connects the principal misdeeds carried out along the way including Hillary Clinton’s devious operations with Fusion GPS, the Comey-led FBI’s illegal entanglement with CIA spying on US citizens (including occupants of the White House), and lately the mendacious maneuvers of House Intel Committee chair Mr. Schiff.\n\n     The notion that Mr. Ciamarella’s identity will remain officially hidden much longer is a joke, since his “complaint” lies at the center of the impeachment process underway, and sooner or later he will be compelled to make public testimony — unless Ms.Pelosi’s House majority votes to rename the USA the Haunted Forest of North America. And when this unmasked phantom finally faces legitimate cross examination his mischief will be plain for all to see. Do you also suppose that Mr. Ciamarella’s revealed adventures in perfidy have not been noticed by the attorney general, Mr. Barr, and his deputy John Durham?\n\n     It seems obvious that the Democrats mad rush to this wholly irregular impeachment happened in direct, proportional response to the encroaching danger to them posed by the DOJ inspector general’s imminent report and the news a week ago that the AG upgraded his “review” of all things RussiaGate to a criminal inquiry, with grand juries assembled to process indictments. In the meantime, Rep. Schiff’s secret proceedings in the House basement seem to have produced little besides evidence that contradicts the premises of his wicked enterprise. One by one, his witnesses have been busted — Mr. Taylor, Col. Vindman, Mr. Morrison, and all the rest — in Mr. Schiff’s quixotic effort to demonstrate that the transcript of Mr. Trump’s phone call to Mr. Zelensky says something other than what can be read plainly in its pages.\n\n     It’s hard to feature how the House might convey their garbage barge of obvious falsehoods to the Senate — the risks are so perilous — but if they dare to, I hope it leads to an actual trial, where due process of law will obtain and, for the first time, a long list of malicious actors in this epic of treachery will actually have to answer for their treasonous activities. Much of what has been documented the past two years about the coup to oust Mr. Trump never made it to the pages of The New York Times, WashPo, and the cable news networks, and may come as a shock to people who read and watch nothing else. For instance, the reportage of Paul Sperry about Mr. Ciamarella at Real Clear Politics this past week, which ripped the mask off this fake pimpernel, has been utterly ignored by those news outlets.\n\n     You could read the desperate anxiety on Speaker Pelosi’s fright-mask face in her various fleeting public statements since August. She might suspect that this long-running enterprise of sedition leads to a political shipwreck more violent than anything seen in the USA since the Civil War. Or just perhaps she is foolishly oblivious, misinformed, and badly advised. If we are fortunate, the damage to come can be confined to the death of the Democratic Party. It’s hard to imagine how they will survive the emergence of the truth about exactly what has gone on at their bidding since the primary elections of 2016.\n\n     The House of Representatives goes on hiatus now for about ten days. There’s a pretty good chance the DOJ IG Horowitz’s report will drop before they return. There’s also more than a fair chance that it will contain a load of damning information about matters connected one way or another to the impeachment inquiry. I doubt the mainstream media will be able to evade reporting on it. There are also indications that the long ordeal of General Michael Flynn’s prosecution is about to end in a debacle for Mr. Mueller‘ gang of attorneys, who have been concealing their turpitudes from Judge Emmet Sullivan’s court since last December. When that case blows up, the reverberations will thunder through every cranny of Washington DC and everything on the battlefield will look different to the people of this land.",

			"body": "Filmmaker Aaron Sorkin's open letter to Mark Zuckerberg published in The New York times was a rallying cry, encouraging Zuckerberg to enable strict fact-checking on Facebook's platform.\n\nHowever, Sorkin's letter itself acted as a perfect exhibit as to the problems with fact-checking as it's been discovered that Sorkin's letter about honoring the truth was full of fake news. \n\nSorkin is well known for fictional stories about real people and his open letter to the Facebook CEO took on the same premise.\n\nWhen you're writing an open letter to demand a powerful organization do more fact-checking, you would think you would take extra care to fact-check your own work before publishing it.\n\nHowever, that's something that it appears Sorkin and even the NY Times didn't bother to do. The piece was full of so many errors the NY Times was forced to rewrite the piece and issue a substantial correction.\n\n    Correction: Oct 31, 2019\n\n    An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which “The Social Network was released. It was 2010, not 2011. The nature of the major lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker was misstated. It was an invasion of privacy lawsuit, not a defamation suit. In addition, information about Americans' use of Facebook as a new source was misstated. In 2018, over 40 percent of Americans said they got news from Facebook; it is not the case that half of all Americans say that Facebook is their main source of news.\n\nPerhaps the most egregious error in the piece was referenced in the Times' final correction. Sorkin's basis for the letter was that it was so important for Facebook to police the content on its platform because Facebook is the “primary” source of news of almost half of Americans. \n\nYet, this turns out to be entirely false. \n\nIn reality, a much smaller percentage said they had found some news on Facebook – upending Sorkin's entire argument and reason for the piece.\n\nFacebook being able to fact-check the content of billions of users in real-time seems like an impossibility when even the paper of record can't manage with a single open letter.",

			"body": "Not only do drones make borders immaterial, but federal officials have also obfuscated the very location of the border. In February of last year, Ricardo Palacios, a 74-year-old rancher in Encinal, Texas, sued CBP for trespassing. His ranch is about 35 miles outside the nearest border crossing, so one would reasonably assume he’s safe in saying he’s firmly on American soil. But when Palacios found and removed a surveillance camera placed on his property by border-patrol agents, he was threatened with lawsuits and criminal charges. CBP, he argued in the suit, has jurisdiction only within 25 miles of the border, not 35.\n\nThe special privileges granted to immigration authorities like CBP are becoming untethered from the geographic border, eroding the rights of people on the ground and, of course, those visible from the air. This is a “border crossing” of its own, a transgression of the constitutionally established boundaries of privacy. These special exceptions encompass enormous swaths of land. If law enforcement can spy on people beyond—and above—its established limits, where exactly does its surveillance jurisdiction end?",

Sellers\n\nWe are clearly entering a Grand Solar Minimum, where “Winter” starts full-bore in November, and may run into March. The Question is how long will it last? years? or decades? and will it set the stage for something deeper, if other natural processes (volcanism, gravitational tilt, solar system angle thru the galaxy, etc) overlap?\n\nConsider that Utah has seen record cold of -43.6 ºF – ‘Perhaps the lowest October temperature ever recorded’ in continental U.S.”\n\nMeteorologist Paul Dorian:  “Perhaps the most amazing temperature recorded in this unusual cold spell for the western US took place earlier today in the remote observing station of Peter Sinks, Utah…the unofficial overnight low temperature there of -43.6 ºF is pretty amazing for this time of year and perhaps the lowest temperature ever recorded in the Lower 48 during the month of October. Nearby Salt Lake City, Utah provided some supporting evidence of the extreme cold as it set a low temperature record of 14 ºF for the date and records there go all the way back to 1874. “\n\nhttps://www.climatedepot.com/2019/10/30/utah-sees-record-cold-of-43-6-of-may-be-lowest-october-temperature-ever-recorded-in-continental-u-s/\n\nThanks to Bill Sellers and Benjamin Napier for this link",

			"body": "Agreed! Mexico is the threat.\n\nDonald Trump has made a lot of exceedingly stupid decisions in the 78,000 dog years he’s been in office, but few compare, in impact and the speed with which they blew up in his face, than the one to withdraw troops from northern Syria, paving the way for Turkey to invade the region and kill our Kurdish allies, leading to one (completely predictable) consequence after the next. Roughly 785 people affiliated with ISIS have escaped; an estimated 100,000 people have been displaced; at least 81 Kurdish fighters and 60 civilians have been killed; the American-allied Syrian Democratic Forces, abandoned by Trump and under attack by Turkey, have teamed up with Bashar al-Assad’s Russian- and Iranian-backed government, giving Vladimir Putin major influence over the region; and approximately 50 nuclear weapons that the the U.S. has stored in the area have now effectively become Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s hostages, which isn’t a great turn of events considering the Turkish president has said as recently as last month that he would like to acquire such ammunition. To be clear, all of this was anticipated; Trump was warned by advisers for months that such disastrous outcomes would result if he followed his vaunted “instincts”—the ones he thinks tell him more than any dumb intelligence memos or briefing books can—and pulled out of Syria, telling the Kurds, who helped us defeat ISIS, that they were on their own because they sat out D-Day like a bunch of bone spur victims. And on Monday, perhaps the most predictable outcome occurred when Trump announced that he would punish Turkey for the bloody mess he created.\n\nIn a statement released on Twitter, the president said that he will “soon be issuing an Executive Order authorizing the imposition of sanctions against current and former officials of the Government of Turkey and any persons contributing to Turkey’s destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.” As a reminder, there’s one person in particular who made a significant contribution to Turkey’s destabilizing actions and his name rhymes with Ronald Grump. According to Axios, the president basically told Erdoğan that the U.S. was fine with him invading Syria, thinking Turkey wouldn’t do it. “Trump basically said, ‘Look, if you want it you own it, but don’t come looking to me for help. You can take it, it’s yours,’” a former senior administration official recounted to Jonathan Swan.\n\nNow that the situation has descended into unstoppable chaos, Trump is naturally acting as though no one could have predicted any of this, and threatening retribution that experts say will do little to stop the unmitigated disaster he set into motion. “I think the likelihood of Turkey invading Northern Syria with U.S. troops there was zero,” Senator Tim Kaine told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on Monday. “And with the U.S. pulling out now, they feel like they have a green light and they're doing exactly what everybody told President Trump that they would do.”\n\nIn addition to vowing sanctions and other measures intended to “swiftly destroy Turkey’s economy,” Trump also spent the afternoon claiming that undocumented immigrants are a bigger threat to the United States than ISIS:\n\n    https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1183823970979713024\n\nAnd making it abundantly clear that reports of a tiny cluster of cells in his chest resembling a human heart were a false positive; in fact, he could not give less of a fuck about living beings that are not Trumps, if this comedy routine is any indication:\n\n    https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1183822494031065088",

And what are his ambitions?\n\nTurning America into the airport.\n\nO’Rourke proposes to gut the Bill of Rights — beginning with the First Amendment and the Second Amendment — to stick the federal snout into Americans’ bedrooms and churches, and anywhere else he detects the scent of nonconformity.",

			"body": "We're all accustomed to everyday users, competitors, regulators, and even governments looking for assurances that their important data would be protected against Google's misuse – but how often does Google have to raise its voice, to make sure its sensitive information is protected out there in the world?\n\nWell – the shoe seems to be well on the other foot here, in a probe conducted in Texas into allegations of the giant's antitrust behavior.\n\nAccording to a report from the Hill, Google is very eager to make sure that third parties, i.e., consultants hired by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to help build the case, “won't leak any confidential information to Google's rivals.”\n\nAnd who knows it better than Google how “sharing” sensitive data with third parties can negatively affect those the data belongs to – Google routinely does it to their billions of users. In fact, its dominance in the tech market in many segments in the US, and in the western world, is squarely built on that “sharing” business model.\n\nBut now that a multi-state probe filed in Texas is underway, Google, formally its parent Alphabet, have their feathers ruffled at the very thought.\n\nGoogle has asked the judge to impose “an order limiting how much sensitive business information the two consultants can obtain and preventing them from working with Google competitors during or after the investigation,” the Hill writes.\n\nThe subtle assertion that Google, in its core businesses, actually has any competitors in the US market aside – the giant's petition cites what appear to be rivals rather than true competitors – America's News Corp and Microsoft, and Russia's Yandex – and consultants who previously worked on these company's cases against Google.\n\nIn the petition, Google says that two of the Attorney General's consultants “work for competitors and complainants.”\n\nBut some observers see this as simply Google's tactic to muddy the waters and delay the proceedings, as it's not at all unusual for the government to “coordinate” with competitors of a company under investigation – after all, this is the same method used in the antitrust case against Microsoft in 2001, brought by the US government.\n\nInternet freedom group Demand Progress executive director David Segal is quoted by the New York Times as saying, “This looks like a sideshow. These are standard delay and deflect tactics by which one of the most powerful corporations in the history of the world are trying to avoid scrutiny.”",

A new contributor, whose first post was published after all of Deadspin’s previous staff writers had resigned, has also been pressured into quitting by Twitter users.\n\nEarlier today, freelance writer and musician Alan Goldsher announced his debut for Deadspin in a now-deleted tweet.\n\n    saved the ratio, gahdamn pic.twitter.com/aCkwke58y3\n\n    — Thomas Cavanagh (@TJCavs_) November 1, 2019\n\nWithin minutes of making the announcement, the replies to the tweet were filled with people accusing him of being a “scab” (a term used to describe people who cross a strikers’ picket and go to work in place of strikers).\n\n    hey the other replies won't load. has anyone called you a scab yet\n\n    — matt // CAB D17 (@Lubchansky) November 1, 2019\n\n    you are a scab forever\n\n    — jonhendrenPeaceful (@fart) November 1, 2019\n\n    Your writing is a cheap imitation of the real thing and you misuse “beg the question.” Just a second rate JV scab seeing playing time because all the talent is gone.\n\n    — Ben (@ma5terblast3r) November 1, 2019\n\nLess than an hour after the original tweet was published, Goldsher had deleted it and announced that an apology was incoming.\n\n    Deleting this tweet. Apology tweet to come.\n\n    — Alan Goldsher (@AlanGoldsher) November 1, 2019\n\nIn his apology thread, Goldsher then announced that his first Deadspin post would be his last and that he was out. He added: “I appreciate that I was pointed in the right direction.”\n\n    I've listened to the room, and I'm out of Deadspin. I hear what you guys are saying, and I respect it. This clearly wasn't a good idea, and I appreciate that I was pointed in the right direction.\n\n    — Alan Goldsher (@AlanGoldsher) November 1, 2019\n\nGoldsher even thanked the Twitter mob for showing him the way the “general public” feels.\n\n    In a weird way, I have to thank you guys for all the insults and cries of \"scab.\" If that hadn't have happened, I would've had no clue that the general public felt this way.\n\n    — Alan Goldsher (@AlanGoldsher) November 1, 2019\n\nSeveral Twitter users highlighted that “Twitter isn’t real life” and questioned Goldsher’s decision to turn down a paycheck after being targeted by an angry Twitter users.\n\n    You're turning down a paycheck because some people yelled at you on Twitter? Twitter isn't real life. Earning money is.\n\n    — Nate Blogg (@BarstoolNate) November 1, 2019\n\n    Twitter mob wins again. At some point people are going to realize the Twitter mob isn't real world. Dude got hired to do a job, did his job and quit/apologized over people on Twitter…sad\n\n    — Paul (@WahooPaulyC) November 1, 2019\n\nOthers said they felt bad for Goldsher and criticized the Twitter brigade for bullying him out of a job where he was “excited to write about sports…on a sports website…where the writers voluntarily quit” and where Goldsher had nothing to do with them quitting.\n\n    He just got cyber bullied for being excited to write about sports…on a sports website…where the writers voluntarily quit because they wanted to write about something else(where they now can). Now they are trying to tank other people's jobs who had nothing to do with it.

			"body": "Hillary Clinton is once again speaking from a position of authority on the subject of data security. That might seem strange, given her past record of recklessly mishandling official emails by storing them on private servers.\n\nBut the topic here was Facebook – specifically, the Cambridge Analytica scandal – and Clinton is presenting herself not a perpetrator of bad practices, but as a victim.\n\nClinton was moderating a panel that discussed a new Netflix documentary, The Great Hack.\n\n“I'm like the hit-and-run victim, who you find on the side of the road,” she said at one point. This concerns the claims that Cambridge Analytica's collection and misuse of Facebook data affected election results in the US presidential race in 2016, which Clinton famously lost.\n\nFacebook's highly problematic practices with data collection and monetizing have been a concern for years, perhaps for as long as the company's existed – yet they were consistently brushed aside by the mainstream media and politicians.\n\nBut now, in the wake of the 2016 election – and more importantly heading into the 2020 vote – giants like Netflix are investing in documentaries that explore the dangers of what one of the filmmakers, Karim Amer, describes as “a broken system.”\n\nDuring the panel, however, Clinton was not merely dwelling on the past – she claims that the practice described in the film “is likely to affect our next election.”\n\nAnd she came down hard on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the controversy of the day – political ads, and Facebook's decision to allow President Trump to run messages that his Democratic rivals deem to be false.\n\n“Mark Zuckerberg should pay a price for what he is doing to our democracy,” Clinton said, while at the same time praising Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for banning political ads on his platform.\n\nA veiled accusation was also made that Zuckerberg might be “conspiring” with Trump by meeting with him, and with some conservative media figures like Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the website Breitbart – and deciding that Facebook would not be the arbiter of truth when it comes to the content of political ads.\n\nShe also had this piece of advice on a subject that she probably knows quite a bit more about than she does about data security. “Propaganda works,” Clinton said. “People act like, ‘Oh I wouldn't be influenced.' That is just baloney.”\n\nHillary Clinton recently said that flashing images on the dark web caused her election loss.",

			"body": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7643251/Charity-hounds-birth-coach-post-saying-women-children.html\n\nIt's just not funny anymore. Women should not be in Parliament, and trannies need to be killed until they shut the hell up.\n\nA woman whose job is to help women give birth made a Facebook post saying that only women birth children. Is this reason enough to “cancel” her from her job as a spokesperson for a charity?\n\nAn online outrage mob led by transgender activists thinks so, and they have been successful.\n\nBefore she made her comments on Facebook, Lynsey McCarthy-Calvert was a spokesperson for Doula UK, a charity specializing in providing trained non-medical help to women during pregnancy and while giving birth.\n\nHer Facebook post was a feminist message, she says, that came in response to a recent trend in the UK of “transgender victories,” including Cancer Research UK removing the word “women” from its cervical cancer awareness campaign, going for the phrase “everyone with a cervix” instead.\n\n“I am not a ‘cervix owner' I am not a ‘menstruator' I am not a ‘feeling'. I am not defined by wearing a dress and lipstick. I am a woman: an adult human female,” was the Facebook post that got McCarthy-Calvert in trouble. She followed up with this:\n\n“Women birth all the people, make up half the population, but less than a third of the seats in the House of Commons are occupied by us.”\nThe online wrath was swift: comments on Facebook accused her of “absolutely disgusting language” and of “forgetting that not only women birth children.”\n\nAbout 20 activists then turned to Doula UK with a letter claiming that McCarthy-Calvert violated the charity's own rules with “trans-exclusionary comments” such as defining a woman as an adult human female.\n\nEqually swiftly Doula UK caved to the online pressure, forcing McCarthy-Calvert to resign as their spokesperson.\n\nShe reacted by expressing her disappointment that the charity gave in to this type of pressure, saying that she resigned believing Doula UK were left “paralyzed” and “terrified” at the prospect of upsetting transgender activists, all the way to “failing to stand up for women's rights.”\n\nDoula UK, however, denied that its decision to force McCarthy-Calvert to step down had anything to do with the fear of themselves becoming the target of what is known as “cancel culture” – the mean-spirited practice of boycotting and shaming people online, and trying to get them to lose their job, for expressing an opinion that's considered questionable by a small group ready to organize itself to pressure people and companies.\n\nInstead, the charity denied that their former spokesperson was driven out, and said they were open to hearing what marginalized groups have to say, and act on it, including by making “changes to the language we use.”\n\nThe Daily Mail story received more than 700 comments, few of which seem to be convinced by Doula UK's explanation, or supportive of the charity's behavior. One comment, that had over 600 upvotes and 0 downvotes, asked a simple question: “This has to be a joke?”",

			"body": "CBS-News carried another bucket of muddy water for the coup team Sunday night with a lead 60 Minutes agit-prop story on Maria Butina, an ambitious Russian cutie who worked the American NRA circuit in the most public manner imaginable to make herself into a sex-bomb celebrity at the exact the moment in history when the US Deep State wished to reinforce the fantasy, as Lesley Stahl put it, that “Russia was interfering in our electoral process.”\n\nOf course, Ms. Stahl and her shifty producers left out half the story: how Maria Butina was manipulated by her FBI-handler and sometime-boyfriend, Patrick Byrne, the former Overstock.com CEO who had been employed by the Bureau over the years on other undercover assignments. They didn’t mention him or seek to understand his role in the operation. But they gave plenty of air-time to the DOJ lawyer, John C Demers, who prosecuted Ms. Butina, and never bothered to ask Demers why Butina was not charged with espionage — perhaps because nothing remotely like that occurred.\n\nHow media giants like Ms. Stahl can keep mouthing this malarkey designed to stoke a new cold war is one of the great mysteries of our national psychology these days. You’d think they’d learned something from the train wreck of the Mueller Investigation, the Brett Kavanaugh fiasco, and the current debacle of Adam Schiff’s imploding Ukraine whistleblower caper — namely, that spouting lies will eventually get you found-out and disgraced.\n\nBut the coup team is now dangerously stuck tripling and quadrupling down on its fairy tale narrative as the reckoning of its dark deeds approaches and its star players await their turns on the witness stand. Half the country has been waiting patiently for authorities-of-standing to put an end to this Hitchcockian campaign of seditious fog that has driven us close to the brink of a second civil war. That half of the country has actually been reading the evidence of this treason and sedition — underwritten by Hillary Clinton and her allies — on the back-channels of the Internet. None of that evidence has been posted through the main media outlets wholly owned by the coup team, gospel to the other half of America, and soon millions of credulous bystanders who got high on three years of CIA-issued RussiaGate Kool-Aid will get the surprise of their lives when they discover how deeply they were played.\n\nThe CIA and the FBI are in a fight for their lives now. The evidence shows pretty clearly that these rogue agencies conducted all the election “meddling” of 2016 and that the RussiaGate hysteria was an engineered smokescreen to hide their tracks and cover their asses when the certainty of a Hillary election triumph nauseatingly resolved unfavorably in the cold, gray dawn of 11/8/16. Despite the chatter about an “insurance policy,” they were quite unprepared for the exposure that loomed.\n\nThey also badly underestimated the resources of what is now a very sturdy alt.media which has managed to weave the real story of what happened over the past three years into a shocking tapestry of massive subversion and treachery. A big part of the true story is how amazingly incompetent the RussiaGate coupsters were. Did they really believe they could conceal the ties between their agencies and Glenn Simpson’s Fusion GPS operation, and its feckless front man, British ex-spy Christopher Steele, and the whole outfit’s connection to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee? Did they suppose they could pass off Stephan Halper and Joseph Mifsud as Russian agents when the two have consorted with US and allied intelligence for decades? The US Department of Defense even holds Mr. Halper’s million-dollar pay stubs and Mr. Mifsud appears in photographs of every Western cloak-and-dagger cocktail get-together of spook officialdom for the last twenty years.\n\nThe latest, and most desperate gambit is the UkraineGate whistleblower, a CIA employee blatantly playing errand-boy for his mentor John Brennan and deeply tied to 2016 election shenanigans emanating from Ukraine, featuring his former employee, ex-Vice-President Joe Biden. This shadowy figure, pegged as Eric Ciaramella, 33, may shortly find himself in a grand jury chamber answering for his role in this charade. Ciaramella has just been hung out to dry by his sponsor, Rep. Adam Schiff in a desperate attempt to dissociate himself from the huggermugger within his House Intel Committee that preceded the falsely blown whistle.\n\nIt’s not an overstatement to say that many of the figures behind this gigantic web of lies and deceit ought to answer charges up to and including treason. The question is whether Messers Barr & Durham have the cojones to cater the banquet of consequences that this huge cast of characters should be made to feast from. Another question is whether these desperate characters and the agencies they represent will go all the way now and attempt to enlist the military brass in an outright overthrow of the executive. There are already",

We’re both mostly centrist with a fair number of “liberal” ideals. Me from the more libertarian side, so not in favor of Central Authority. Him from a more traditional left leaning POV.\n\nBut one place where we’re divergent is in understanding why the old party hard core stays in power. At 79, he thinks Pelosi is past her sell by date. Doesn’t understand why she would still be elected.\n\nI “get it” that lust for power and the desire to graft off a few $Million / year is a powerful drug. Couple that with rules that say the one who’s been in congress the longest gets the power (seniority rules) and then being able to sell that “back home” with a “Re-Elect Me and I’ll have all the power to get the most bacon for YOU! (small vig for me along the way…)” sells well to the Donor Class and the DNC power brokers (and their vig…)\n\nThen Tim is also puzzled why Bernie supporters don’t support Trump on his investigation into Biden since Biden is “in the way” of Bernie. Well, it’s because the far left doesn’t think well, or much, but “feels” a lot and they “feel” murderous woke rage toward Trump because the TLA / Deep State run YSM has told them too. If they were strategic thinkers, they would not be supporting Socialism…\n\nBut that aside, it is fun to see that the WT? Pelosi? Puzzlement Line has now moves well past “moderate left” ;-)",

			"body": "https://meng.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-meng-jayapal-and-garc-a-joined-by-immigration-advocacy\n\nhttps://fortune.com/2019/10/30/new-house-immigration-bills/\n\nCan think of nothing more effective at bringing the fence sitters from their seats than these continuous acts of treason......\n\n\n\nDemocrats joined with immigrants and refugee rights activists at the Capitol last week to introduce a bill that would create a federal bureaucracy for the express purpose of bringing more people into the United States and helping to resettle them.\n\nThe New Deal for New Americans Act would “establish a National Office of New Americans in the Executive Office of the White House to promote and support immigrant and refugee integration and inclusion and coordinate efforts of federal, state, and local governments to support social, economic, and civic integration of immigrants and refugees.”\n\nThe bill if it becomes law would “ban deportations based on public charge determinations, and increase federally funded immigration services like English classes and workforce training,” Fortune magazine reported.\n\nFurther, Democrats and activists want to raise the cap for refugees from the Trump administration current limit of 18,000 annually to 110,000 and freeze immigration application fees — also reversing a Trump administration increase in cost to come into the United States to benefit the U.S. economy and its citizens.\n\nAt a press conference to introduce the legislation, Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY), one of the sponsors of the bill, did not say how the influx of people who impact Americans in the jobs market.\n\nMeng also said she and other Democrats behind the bill – Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill) – were still waiting from a score from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on how much it would cost American taxpayers.\n\nThe issue of immigrants who are here illegally or how to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the country was not addressed at the press conference.\n\n“This is a critical bill at a critical time,” Jayapal said. “This is about who is here and how we make sure they get what they truly need.”\n\n“Trump is closing the doors on people who have the right to be here,” Garcia said. “We as a country are better than that.”\n\n“The treatment immigrants currently receive is not representative of our values,” Garcia said.\n\nEva Millona, director of the Massachusetts Immigration and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, repeated the popular talking point on the left about the need for more foreign workers.\n\n“This bill is extremely important,” Millona said. “As the native born population ages, immigrant workers will be crucial to our economy.”\n\n“It is quite simple,” Millona said. “America needs immigrant workers.”\n\nBut as Breitbart News reported earlier this year foreign workers have now outpaced American workers in terms of job growth for at least half a year, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data reveals:\n\n    While native-born Americans did not increase their labor participation rate at all year-to-year, foreign-born workers saw a 1.22 percent increase in their labor participation rate. Likewise, the number of foreign-born workers in the civilian labor force increased more than five times the number of new native-born American workers who are now in the labor force.\n\n    California's poverty rate is worse than Alabama & Mississippi, says Census Bureau. The major cause of this huge change is immigration policy which spikes housing costs & shrinks wages — and delivers huge gains for investors in real-estate & corp. shares. https://t.co/mEjCP83Hkr\n\n    — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 13, 2019\n\nA report from the Center for Immigration Studies using federal data shows that mass immigration encourages discrimination against American workers.\n\n“You really have to be out of touch with reality to argue that there are no negative effects of immigration on native workers,” said Jason Richwine, a statistician who studied the issue for the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nSome of the other features of the bill include:\n\n    Amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to no longer allow deportation of an individual deemed to have become a public charge.\n    Establish a Federal Initiative on New Americans to coordinate a federal response to address issues that affect the lives of new immigrants and refugees, and communities with growing immigrant and refugee populations.\n    Create a Workforce Development Grant Program to ensure that immigrant and refugee adults have equitable access to education and workforce programs that help equip them with occupational skills needed to secure or advance in employment.\n    Promote civic engagement through automatic voter registration of newly naturalized individuals. \n    Expand family integration by reducing the age of citizens who are able to petition eligible family members from 21-years-old to 18-years-old.",

			"subject": "Elizabeth Warren’s “Meme Team” highlight how much Democrats struggle to understand the art of memes",
			"body": "Oh the lultz.I\n\nf you can't beat them – try to join them. That's one way to describe the relationship Democrats have had with the meme culture over the past couple of years.\n\nThey've gone from denouncing memes as a vile vehicle that helped propel Donald Trump to power, to attempting to embrace them, now that another presidential election looms large.\n\nIn the opposite corner is once again Trump, who, love him or hate him, is by now universally recognized as a social media force to be reckoned with.\n\nHis political opponents and media outlets behind them have for years tried to get the President off Twitter; the platform's decision last week to ban ads promoting “politics and issues” was enthusiastically welcomed by Democrats, who (quite possibly mistakenly) believe that this will chip away at the Trump campaign's social media mojo.\n\nAware of all this, one of the Democratic presidential hopefuls, Elizabeth Warren, has decided to add some meme flare to her own campaign. It's a step in the right direction, but it's going to be an uphill battle to achieve success in this arena, observers are saying.\n\nFor one thing, it shouldn't be a battle at all. Successful memes and campaigns revolving around them are organic and natural – often as much about having fun by expressing an opinion or even just a sense of humor, as they are about marketing that opinion to others. This authenticity, rebellion, and effortlessness is what makes memes popular, and in the end, successful.\n\nAs if to prove their seemingly profound misunderstanding of memes, US mainstream media recently fact-checked as fun photo-edited image of Trump bestowing a medal on a dog who recently helped track down the ISIS leader, which Trump himself retweeted.\n\n    AMERICAN HERO! pic.twitter.com/XCCa2sGfsZ\n\n    — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2019\n\nThe visually crude edit is an integral part of why the meme's funny in the first place, but that point went right over the heads of Trump's media detractors, who, as The Daily Wire points out, published articles about the president “disseminating a doctored image created by a right-wing propaganda site.”\n\nWith this attitude in mind, it's not surprising that there's little that seems organic or natural about the effort of the Warren's Meme Team, which describes itself as a grassroots organization.\n\nThey have put together a 9-page document (mirror) that painfully overthinks the meme phenomenon and reads almost like an attempt to find a scientific formula for a successful meme-driven social media presence.\n\nAs if for added credibility, the “plan” is littered with emojis that stand in stark contrast to the tone of the document.\n\nWill it succeed?\n\nIndependent US journalist and political commentator Tim Pool's answer to this question is a hard “no.”\n\n“The meme war will once again be won by the right and anyone who bets otherwise would be a fool,” he says.\n\nIn a YouTube video Pool unpacks the reasons why Democrats and leftists attempting to incorporate memes into their campaigns represents almost a case of cultural appropriation – as the very nature of their ideology is different from that of Republicans and conservatives.\n\nThe left, he argues, is driven by a grim pursuit of political correctness even at the price of bullying and ostracizing (“canceling”) people for stepping out of ideological line – also known as the outrage culture. It's an exhausting and joyless effort – and some of the more astute figures on the left, like Barack Obama, are now speaking out against “woke outrage” – likely as they realize it will eventually backfire.\n\nOn the other hand, a successful meme often requires the creator to take risks and push the boundaries of humor. According to Pool, the left simply doesn't have what it takes to engage in “a meme war” as it's constrained by its endless quest for political correctness and the stamping out of “harmful jokes.”\n\nTo prove this point, the commentator mentions a recent op-ed published in the New York Times that recognizes the importance of memes, but misses their point entirely.\n\nInstead of getting out of their comfort zone to embrace the true nature and the rules of the game of memes, the article speaks in favor of using them to double down on “righteous progressive outrage” on issues such as climate change, inequality, and corruption.\n\nBut, as Pool pointed out in his YouTube video – “If you can make memes that are funny and fun, but you want regular people to make them, you run the risk of those people being ‘canceled' for being offensive.”",

Now according to many of you reactionaries, SJWs should be freaking the hell out and trying to ruin the entire cast lives. After all Mel Brooks often had Hitler in his movies and you all clam that his movies couldn't be made today. And yet I haven't seen anyone get angry about this. No protests, no attempts at canceling anyone's career, no outrage, it got less of a reaction than the original Producers which got boycotted by Jewish groups because of Spring Time for Hitler. So, ya, this kind of proves all your bitching and moaning about how Social Justice and Feminist ruining media to be completely horseshit.\n\nRedius\n3 points ·\n3 hours ago\nSaw the trailer, thought it looked funny, being german, I must see every movie about Hitler especially when Americans are directing it.\n\nDid you know: 6 out of 8 Movies about or with Hitler in it are made in America?\n\nThat's a bit like, as if your cellmate reminding you about your crimes while jerking off to a picture of\none of his victims.\n\nAnyhow: OP is trolling. There is \"rage\" and all this shit, unemployed xylakants are doing in their free\ntime. Because making Comedies about Nazi are bad or something.\n\nMaybe I start making movies about the native American genocide and only show them in the US.\n\n​\n\nSo I just wanted to say, Thank You. Thank you to all the over sensitive bitches who just deeply desired to prove me right by spending the last few minuets doing nothing but complain about this post. Your attempts to save face our hysterical and just serve to prove me right.",
