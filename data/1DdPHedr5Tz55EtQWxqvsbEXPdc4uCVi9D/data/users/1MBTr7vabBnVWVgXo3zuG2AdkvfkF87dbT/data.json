The newest version has many new features and bugfixes.\nBut the most important bugfix is that in the version this board is running ==content that is muted is still shared because of a bug==.\nSince the site owner doesn't seem particularly technical, an official update does not seem to be very likely to happen in the near future. '''There probably is a way to override the official version and run the new version client-side'''\nThis mechanism would also allow users to patch their own software to add new features.\nSome of the bug fixes and features that I can think of:\n-Currently Zeronet opens too many Tor circuits, banning us from the Guard node.\n-No option to disable BO blacklist by default.\n-I don't liike the rotating placeholder, too distracting.\n-Announce to trackers more often. When all trackers all lost re-announce takes too long.\n-No way to limit number of total connections, which can overload Tor and cheap home routers.\n-Of course, the anti-fingerprint features preventing posting bug with Tor Browser,  but that's already fixed in the new version of Millchan.\n-No way to sage. Not sure if that's on the new Millchan version.\nI'm going to begin reading the docs to see what I can dig up. Anyone who wants to help? https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/",

People who have it on \"Disable\" should be a very small minority.\nIf you really want to take advantage of those people's speed you can just run Tor as a standalone service, in which case it'll go through an exit node. No need or benefit for using a VPN (unless your VPN offers a hidden service to connect to -something that's not very common I think- and is faster than the Tor exit node).",
