They'll probably give you less information than the ZeroID that's now required, and they're something the US goverment ''always'' had access to on 8ch. The whole article reeks of lefty posturing.",

It's much more of a ban than a mute, and the permanent ID should probably be replaced with a more anonymous method like proof of work where the work required to post is based on a setting of the board. I also fear that because the information is available to look up anyone's post history across the site, people who do do that and make a fuss about it will start to come in and turn this place into a more traditional forum. Since >(1) posting was accepted on /v/ I don't think there are many people left who actually want an anonymous forum.",

This was done in order to combat spam, but hopefully it will only be temporary.\n\n==How Do I Post==\nYou'll need to go to ZeroID http://127.0.0.1:43110/1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/ and register a username. Afterwards, on the top right of 08chan there should be a circle with the ZeroNet logo inside; click and drag it to the left to reveal 08chan's ZeroNet menu. Scroll down until you see the \"IDENTITY ADDRESS\" field and click change. In the popup window that appeared, click your ID that you just registered (somename@zeroid.bit). Dismiss the menu by clicking and dragging the ZeroNet logo to the right.\n\n==Why Is No One Posting in My Thread==\nOnly the people who've downloaded a self-signed thread before the switch to ZeroID can see and post in them. Anyone who hasn't downloaded it will not be able to do so. As such, if you want more people to see something post in a new thread or make one.\n",
