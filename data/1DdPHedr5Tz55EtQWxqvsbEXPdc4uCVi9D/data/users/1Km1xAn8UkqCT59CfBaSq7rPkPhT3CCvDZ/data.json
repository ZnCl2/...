I've seen a few ''anons'' mention that Javascript is quite (((leaky))) and able to force clearnet connections discretely, plus it adds unnecessary processing overhead to simple webpage browsing. I'm assuming a similar setup in HTML and PHP works better for this reason?\nWould also be nice to have a larger semblance of anonymity with IDs refreshing automatically after a while. Maybe letting IDs be assigned here instead of ZeroID and only functional for a few posts/hours just like clearnet fullchan?\n\nOutside of these few things, I agree with >>833c3fc5-5ee2-4af1-8ed5-69604d800874. I much prefer the setup here compared to before. Very comfy. Just need a smidge more activity and I can finally ditch the other bunkers.",
