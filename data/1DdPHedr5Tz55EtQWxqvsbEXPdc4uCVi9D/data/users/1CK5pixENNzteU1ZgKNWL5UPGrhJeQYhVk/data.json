Overcoming or bypassing these systems is. \n\n>>cf0e2699-f2b1-4756-adc9-90179e56f97c this also raises concerns about cycling as transportation. Do they have plates or do they just use their faces? \n\n>>fd490b5e-c7fa-4cd2-9470-e8a037600242 I totally agree. I plan on migrating here permanently. Zeronet really needed a catalyst to increase its popularity due to the very nature of it and now we have that. I'd encourage anyone who's capable to try and contribute to the source code on github. It's written in python so it's a great beginners project. I'm going to start messing with it myself after I get some bearings in it. It's a cool idea and I want to support the community.  https://github.com/HelloZeroNet?tab=repositories\n\nAlso, don't forget there are other sites here. Use Kaffiene, a Zeronet search engine, to help you:http://127.0.0.1:43110/kaffiene.bit/\nI'm thinking of using Zeronet for a git repo,  similar to this: \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1MCfWoCtcbPXYc3rhYhKeSAWVpzAQYyWKS",
