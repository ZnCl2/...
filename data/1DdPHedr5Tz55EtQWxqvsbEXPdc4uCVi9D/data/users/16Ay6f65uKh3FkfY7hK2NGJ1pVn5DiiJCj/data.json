They weren't risky '''at all'''. Jobs just somehow put together the money to have a good team of developers and engineers polish them as a finished consumer product and make them a little easier for normalfags to use, along with throwing enormous marketing campaigns at people to convince them their products were hip and trendy.",

Currently quantum computers are so powerful that you need to apply statistical methods to find the minute speedups provided by it to know whether they are actually any faster than a regular computer. It's not clear useful quantum computers will ever be developed.\nAnd even if they are, it's possible to design QC-resistant public key cryptography methods.",
