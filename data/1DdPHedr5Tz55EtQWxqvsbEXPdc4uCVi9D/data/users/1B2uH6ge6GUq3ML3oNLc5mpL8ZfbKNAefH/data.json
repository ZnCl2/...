All the links that I found on the clearnet don't seem to work or link to degenerate shit that's not 8chan. \n\nEDIT: Well, never mind. It took an eternity to load, but I did find the correct address after all. Sorry for being a noobfag.\n\nhttp://oxwugzccvk3dk6tj.onion\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1DdPHedr5Tz55EtQWxqvsbEXPdc4uCVi9D/?:users/13E1NfoEM9eYfxk3mZQTLW5qYBekTp5W7v:v:e0a6634e-bb76-4cb6-9c34-719011e548da",
