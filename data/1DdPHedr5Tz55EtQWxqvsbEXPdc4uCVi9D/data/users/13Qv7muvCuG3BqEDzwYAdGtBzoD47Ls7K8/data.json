Since it uses BitTorrent, aren't files transferred in packets? There would be no easy way to learn exactly where each packet fits and exactly who is the originator for each packet. Plus, ZeroNet requires a post to be seeded by 5 other peers, so each post has 6 peers immediately seeding it upon posting.\n\n>>d96ddf37-b463-4f1e-9384-945a52d7bcd0\n>How does ZeroID allow them to link posts with IPs?\nIt doesn't.
