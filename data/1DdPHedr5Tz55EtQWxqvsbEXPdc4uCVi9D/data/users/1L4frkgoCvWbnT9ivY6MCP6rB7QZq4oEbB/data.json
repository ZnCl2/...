In that case, enable TOR for all connections and if you want to be even safer, use the TOR Browser Bundle and you should be pretty safe.\n\nAlso, enable the \"Help distribute new files\" option for this site if at all possible to make it easier for everyone.",

You can select the servers and a few of them give you direct connection to the TOR network as well without having to run your own node.\n\nThey use OpenVPN and you can download the connection profiles to run using the regular OpenVPN client or from your router instead of their software if you want.",
