Also there is an inactive ID authority that require e-mail verification before identity is active.

Simply as >>f813708a-34f0-478f-b4e1-199042c61381 says:\n> \"Previously you used self-signed certs, so you pretty much allowed everything on the board ...

So old ones will work, but new users will have to use zeroid.bit ?

			"body": "note for readers, i think the Tor ports mentioned in the above zeronet.conf may be different on Windows/Linux.\n\nRegarding \"trackers =\" variable, i am wondering whether it is good idea to \"hardcode\" these in config file. I would think better for ZN to discover new up to date trackers on its own? Or these trackers are mainly bootstrap ones added by zeronet maintainer? Myself i add trackers via UI: http://127.0.0.1:43110/Config\n\nRegarding \"trackers_file = \", people have to visit site 15CEFKBRHFfAP9rmL6hhLmHoXrrgmw4B5o in order for ZN to use it i think.\n\nRegarding \"*connected_limit\" (Max connected peer per site (default: 8)) and \"workers\" (Download workers per site), why do you think it is good like this (for Raspberry)? Why not to set more workers and why to reduce number of connected peers per site?",
