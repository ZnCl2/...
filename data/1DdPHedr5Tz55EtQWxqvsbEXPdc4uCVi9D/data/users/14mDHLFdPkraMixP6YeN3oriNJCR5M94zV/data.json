And I doubt that there is a files list sent to everyone, but rather a request for a file. ZeroNet would have been stupidly inefficient and slow that way.\nSomeone would have to have an updated list of every ID's list of files they own, and constantly update it. There is already over 13GB of data here, so if you multiple that by let's say 2000 IDs with 13GB, that's 26,000 GB or about 25.39 TB after everyone seeds everything. This list is also constantly updating and changing. Someone needs a huge database, and work with tons of assumptions. Heck writing something that does that would cost CIA boomers their yearly allowance.\n\nGiven enough time, there might be a sequence of data that can identify every one of us, but even still, I don't think feds or the CIA have the autism to do that. The fucking feds kept the (you)'s in their report.\n\nBesides, you can just go delete a couple random files every now and then.\n\n",

Research seed ratio based proof-of-work for posting, which would allow decentralized anonymous posting without additional CPU usage\n>19. Add pinktext support\n\nAlso, one more note.\n\nAs of now, anyone not connected to a VPN or using Tor to post here is declaring their IP and what they own, so to mitigate or eliminate that without sacrificing a lot in speed is a crucial step in this site's future.\n\nIs it possible t hash IPs at some step that will truly anonymize everyone?\n\nIf not, is it possible that instead of pseudoanonymity we have now, the IPs get shuffled? Every peer will act like a spokesperson of another peer. They won't declare their IP, but only what that peer owns, and then download requested files to memory and send them over. Nothing is stored in the hard drive. \n\nSo, every peer will act as a relay for another peer which will increase bandwidth use, but is kind of anonymous.\n\nSo, the first thing a connected user will do is look for a relaying peer. Every peer they ask will accept if they aren't already hosting for someone. If they are hosting, they will decline. Once the newly connected user runs out of peers to ask, they will ask again previously asked peers.\nThe first one they ask will have to check with others how many they are hosting. If one person is hosting two, they will decline. This is to prevent exploitation of the system since you can only have odd or even number of users connected, there cannot exist more than 1 peer who dual hosts.\n\nIf a user disconnects, they will connect whoever they are hosting to the peer who was hosting them.\n\nThis is only applied for uploads. I don't think it is necessary for downloads, but correct me if I am wrong.\nIt will be as if everyone in a hall just switched IDs with someone else. If there are plenty of people connected, it will be hard to pin down everyone's IP.\nMaybe randomize relays and peers every now and then as well.",
