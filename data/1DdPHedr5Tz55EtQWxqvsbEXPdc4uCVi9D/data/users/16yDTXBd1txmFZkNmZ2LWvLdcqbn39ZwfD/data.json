This conspiracy, which basically says that Epstein was silenced for someone's protection, I believe will become a real \"mainstream\" conspiracy. People on all sides are obviously aware that the headlines are false and that something fishy is going on, and they are all scrambling to blame \"whodunnit\". This is a classic whodunnit case and nobody believes he actually committed suicide. THe moajority of the population will belive in a conspiracy theory. Again, people on all sides believing the same thing.\n\nDiscuss.",
