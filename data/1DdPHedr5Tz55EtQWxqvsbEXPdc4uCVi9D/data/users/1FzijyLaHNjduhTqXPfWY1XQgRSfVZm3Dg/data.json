Since zeronet doesn't allow you to change your number of connections, you instead isolate connections more, so you don't get banned from tor nodes because you're spreading your connections harder.\nThere's a donwnside do that, starting tor connections is slow, so if you're starting a tor connection for everything you do, then everything you do slows down.\nYou can isolate tor connections by destination IP for instance, that should make every zeronet peer you have use a different connection.\nRead the manual.",
