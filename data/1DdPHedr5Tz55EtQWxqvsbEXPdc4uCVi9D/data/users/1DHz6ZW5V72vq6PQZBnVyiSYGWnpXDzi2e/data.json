Bush’s speechwriting team. One-time staffer Ziad Ojakli also worked for Bush and then moved first to Ford Motor Co. where he was a vice president then to Softbank as senior vice president.\n\nFormer aide Tom Keller is the president of Keller Partners & Co., a boutique lobbying and government relations firm. Former media aide Tim Goeglein, who also worked in the Bush White House, is a vice president at Focus on the Family in Washington.\n\nOutside the Beltway, former aide Curt Smith is the director of the Indiana Family Policy Council.\n\n“If Dan Coats is not a good man, there are no good men,” said Goeglein during a stop at the Heritage Foundation to talk about his new book, American Restoration: How Faith, Family, and Personal Sacrifice Can Heal Our Nation.\n",

Plant a *small* seed, change the subject. In a different convo, water that seed a little bit, change the subject. Plant a new small seed. People have to have time to process information.  Some people take a lot longer than others. If you just gently plant & water seeds, then they will start asking you questions that you can answer (in short form). \n\nOverloading them leads to a large mental wall slamming down and resistance in the future. I think this is where people go wrong when trying to red-pill family members. In some ways, planting those seeds and gently watering them helps us, too because we learn to gauge people and what works and doesn't.\n\nJMO",

Secondly, if you try to force the issue they will resist ever more strongly the more you push.\n\nIt's really a delicate process because that seed, like all seeds, grows both downward (roots in the unconscious) and sprouts upwards (to the conscious). Understand that their unconscious is struggling, and their conscious will reject what you say. But if you are gentle and let those seeds grow in their mind, it will happen. It takes time, and it, like all of this, doesn't happen on your or my timeline-desire, it happens as their mind can allow it to grow.\n\nIt's really, really difficult to be patient.

Gavin Newsom is “unconstitutional.”\n\n“Though states may exercise some control over elections, they cannot do so in a way that burdens a candidate’s First Amendment rights,” Trump's lawyer William Consovoy said in the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.\n\nThe law is aimed at Trump, who has refused to release his tax returns despite repeated demands from Democrats.\n\nNew York recently passed a law giving congressional committees access to Trump’s state tax returns. A judge last week blocked New York from turning over Trump’s state tax returns to congressional Democrats while Trump’s challenge to the law plays out.\n\nIn California, even if the law holds up to a legal challenge, Trump could chose to not compete in the state’s primary. He likely won’t need the state’s delegates to win the Republican nomination with no serious primary challenger.\n\n",

Bette Bolivar's name was redacted from the documents, the deep sea diver was the commanding officer of the Salvor at the time. Safeguard-class ships such as the Salvor are usually only assigned six officers, and Bolivar's biography matches that of the female officer described in the documents.\n\nA Navy spokesman contacted by the Washington Examiner would not confirm or deny that Bolivar was the officer referenced in the report.

Q posts are structured in a way to lead from point to point, but an analog of one idea to another, not necessarily (always) linear.\n\nFor example - words in single quotes, words in double quotes, re-read vs re_read, words that have Initial capitals, to Both Capitals, to ALL CAPITALS, stuff in (parenthesis), stuff in [brackets]\nALL of those things have meaning(s), should be linked together and analyzed together:\nall lower case > Initial Caps > ALL CAPS\n'single quote'  > \"double quote\"\n\nSequence or progression is important or it wouldn't have been used!\n\nI don't know if you were there or saw the 3 different Mayday posts/requests, but they were very interesting. I do NOT buy into the premise of the 3rd one, but they were very good exercises in what I think was meant to be a productive thinking process for analysis of Q drops. I'm going to start a thread on it - and cross post your posts and  the initial analysis so it will be together there, and will link here so others will know.\n",

			"body": "Q posts use the '''Socratic question method''' to prompt the reader to think in a non-linear, analogical and allegorical manner. We are meant to draw conclusions in multi-layered manner: multiple meanings exist and News unlocks the map.\n\nThere have been several occasions where mysterious \"Mayday\" posts were made, same Socratic method of questions were used. Whether or not that poster was legitimate is unknown and not necessarily relevant, ''but'' they provided an excellent exercise in using analogical and non-linear thinking to \"decode\" those posts, which can (and should) be applied to Q posts overall.\n\nWithin Q posts, there are various methods used to call attention to words or phrases, which are repeated throughout different posts, sometimes in an increasing sequence: lower case > Initial Caps > ALL CAPS, 'single quotes' > \"double quotes\", showing a word that has multiple definitions and calling attention to that.\n\nAnons have done an amazing job of digging but our decoding of the larger body of Q posts, especially in relationship to each other has been lacking, and may limit our intended understanding of the plan and what is occurring today. This thread will use those Mayday posts and analysis to have a new fresh look at Q posts, news, photos and tweets to try weave together in a coherent manner what we are supposed to learn and understand.\n\n",

Which of his attorneys was responsible to turn over the flight logs/evidence that was mysteriously 'sanitized' to remove their name? What attorney is screaming the loudest right now? DERSHOWITZ Now that legal precedent has been set, evidence Dershowitz (and others) have kept is now open to be used against them (though names redacted in court: Individuals 1, 2, 3). That BRIDGE has been damaged.\n\nRE-APPLY:\nRachel Chandler, in her assigned role, took many photos of both victims (\"models\" = children available within the ring) and \"clients\" (perps) freezing them all in place and time to create documentation used within/by the ring for control purposes (extortion). Rachel Chandler is one bridge, linking people, places, times, events. She made this explicit by including herself in the first photo, though her face is obscured by the flash (intentional). In her role, she is the black to the victims' white, opposite roles (behind camera, in front of camera; accomplice vs victim, position of some power vs powerless).\nIn the photos of \"models\" (victims trafficked) there are symbols/items that convey codes to those that know (wristbands of a certain color, positions of hands/other body parts, fe); photo of surveillance monitors shows large operations with many rooms, catering to different desires (like Eyes Wide Shut) of different people. Surveillance monitors' feed is recorded and provides documenation as well. The documentation provided by still/video, as well as pattern of behavior, travel, statements etc, helps to create a solid case (stable bridge between data points) against perps - assertion of reality after answering questions correctly. People implicated in the ring (perps or accomplices) do/will spin illusion: deflection, denial, falsification, blame-shifting etc, especially difficult to coordinate if their BRIDGES are no longer functional (no more attorney-client privilege): insecure/unstable bridge -->assertion of illusion (false narrative). Ezra Cohen-Watnick is likely a bad actor (plant) placed to be a different kind of bridge between previous admin, ring, rogue intel so that they could be apprised of investigations (and progress) and countermeasures could be taken.\n\n\nGRAPHIC: https://media.8ch.net/file_store/cd74eab73c7a7e568d632f30c1fcbedb1de70cc319d0e3fff73b789ae02a0483.png\nhttps://postimg.cc/bsC9pGDx\nQ 3131\n",

Scavino posts cryptic photo on facebook with never before seen meme of Trump and \"THE END\" showing in the mirror.\n\nThe scavino one is weird cus the photographer is showing in the shot... so it's obvious that they didn't crop it on purpose. Read between the lines, it's go time anons.\n\nSauces:\nScavino pic - https://www.facebook.com/DanScavino/photos/a.1963839477165112/2353659208183135/?type=3&theater\n\nTrump tweet - https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\nLook at his retweet from around 7amCT\n...................\nSCAVINO PHOTO - what do we see?\nScavino pic w/ photog showing is reminiscent of Rachel Chandler's Self Portrait Marfa journal.\n>pic related\nThe photog showing themselves IN the picture is very intentional. Who is the photographer here? Looks an awful lot like RC!! (see >>ab637c21-929c-4e53-a8be-7b1054eedb18 first photo)\n\nThe images around the bottom of the mirror and up the side are added in later (not reflections) obviously of people and places - too small for me to really see clearly. BUT - there is a large, large photo with POTUS on it with arm outstretched, black background and the word \"The End\"\n\n-Some are outside (top left- 3 people),\n-one on bottom left corner & center look like in oval office, and\n-bottom right looks like medal of honor ceremony or something\n\nPhoto right behind man at desk - that's (POTUS with very messy hair?) and someone with dark hair, glasses & a beard and a woman who looks like Sara Huckabee Sanders. What's on the tv screen behind the man with messy blonde hair?\nBehind that photo, on its side is a POTUS tweet - visible text says line 1- Thanks-many, line 2- character write, line 3- it's fun.\nPOTUS TWEET: \nThanks- many are saying I'm the best 140 character writer in the world. It's easy when it's fun.\n7:23 AM 10 Nov 2012\n\n'Monster' energy drink on the desk - NOT Diet Coke, which is what POTUS normally drinks\nThere is a POTUS' name on the white hard hat on the right.\nAbove the large photo of POTUS (\"The End\") there is a monitor with 4 network news channels, sort of like RC's with the multi-channel surveillance re: Epstein... able to watch multiple \"channels\" at the same time.\n\nThere's more to be seen, but better eyes will have to look!\n\nINITIAL APPLICATION:\nPerson sent to document (photographer) man at desk (working hard) - POTUS communicates with us by various means (tweets, photos), is for the People (hard hat) and working hard to rebuild our Country (Presidential seal high on wall behind photog) with many other people (people outside photos, people in Oval Office photos, etc.) in different positions, with a lot of surveillance (monitor on wall with 4 different rooms/scenes) / knows what's going on and tries to let us know in different ways. Photo 2 men, woman are in that same room, with the mirror on the wall and the 3 people all watching the monitor (looks like 1 channel, very blurry).\n\nWhat about that POTUS tweet?\nTWEET TEXT: \n>As we commemorate #DDay75, let us give thanks for the valiant Allied Soldiers who helped turn the tide of the Second World War on that fateful day.\n\n\nWhat jumps out immediately:\n>thanks to the valiant Allied soldiers\n>helped turn the tide\n< 3rd meme war\n>fateful day\n\n\nAPPLY:\nPOTUS is thanking his valiant soldiers in the Alliance (all those anons out in the world who follow Q, anons/autists & awesome people), who are helping to turn the tide in this 3rd World War (meme war, and war against the /cabal/) on this fateful day (the day they thought they could strangle us by cutting off 8ch!).\n\n==RE-APPLY==\nPOTUS sees a lot and is behind Q, is letting us know he's watching, appreciates our efforts as his allied soldiers in this fight, is working hard to communicate with us in unconventional (but brilliant) ways. He hopes we understand the comms and think it's also fun, we are a bunch of characters, men and women, both outside (the system) and inside (undercover Patriots). POTUS is reaching out to tell us this is not the end for US but for them.",

Lindsey Graham, leading separate inquiries into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, have obtained an audio deposition of Joseph Mifsud, the mysterious Maltese academic who claimed Russia had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe revelation about Mifsud came from The Hill’s John Solomon, who spoke with Sean Hannity on Fox News last Thursday. Solomon’s widely reported bombshell last week was that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz had criminally referred former FBI James Comey to the DOJ because of his alleged leaking of classified information in his memos and a lack of candor with investigators, but the DOJ declined prosecution.\n\nBut this tidbit about Mifsud made fewer headlines. \n<snip>\nMifsud’s alleged attorney Stephan Roh said in late July that Durham intended to interview Mifsud. He said that if an interview failed to pan out, Durham's team at least wanted to view a recorded deposition Mifsud gave in 2018 on his role in the Trump-Russia controversy. Roh said he would provide at least one page of the deposition to Durham's investigators.\n\nSolomon told Hannity that Durham’s team “obtained an audiotaped deposition of Joseph Mifsud, where he describes his work, why he targeted Papadopoulos, who directed him to do that, what directions he was given, and why he set that entire process of introducing George Papadopoulos to Russia in motion in March of 2016.”\n\nSolomon called the meeting between Papadopoulos and Mifsud “really the flash point, the starting point of this whole Russia collusion narrative.” And Solomon said Graham “has also obtained the same deposition.”\n\n“So you now have the Senate and a federal prosecutor,” Solomon said.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_dj-3eqPNvo \n",

Such societies offered social and self-improvement activities as well as life and disability insurance at a time when neither was common. \nHer motivation was two of her best pupils, whose mother had died without insurance, and their father had placed the children with well-to-do families to care for the children but the daughter was a domestic servant and the son a stable boy. As West saw it, the youngsters had been torn from their family and denied a formal education because life insurance was unavailable for women.\nOver the next 56 years, West devoted herself to her mission. As state organizer for the Ladies of the Maccabees, she built its membership from 319 in 1892 to 5,770 in 1894. The organization, later renamed the Women’s Benefit Association, had 75,224 members in 42 states by 1900. Four years later, it had nearly 150,000 members and 40 employees at its Port Huron headquarters.\nhttps://phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/maccabees.htm\n\"In less than 12 years, (it) was no doubt the great business movement of women in the world,\" Yates wrote.\nThe rapid growth led the Maccabees to build a second temple in 1904 at the intersection of Huron and Pine Grove avenues. The original temple, built in 1892 at Huron and Bard, was noted for its hive-shaped brass domes. It became the Algonquin Hotel in 1906 and was destroyed in a fire in 2000.\nPort Huron's mayor declared a public holiday on Oct. 22, 1915, when the cornerstone was placed for the association's headquarters on Military Street. The structure, with an exterior of Indiana limestone and Corinthian columns flanking its entrance, would be dedicated two years later. \nA sign in West's office gave the motto - \"Hard Work and Ever At It\" - that she embraced until her retirement at age 81. She died in 1954.\nThe Woman's Life Insurance Society, as the association is known today, is still based in Port Huron. Janice Whipple, who took over in 1990, is only its sixth president in more than a century. \nTHE PHOTO ANON POSTED IS OF THE \"FIRST KNIGHTS OF THE MACCABEES BLDG, PORT HURON, MI (not Ladies of the Maccabees)\nIn 1926, they established their headquarters at the Maccabees Building in downtown Detroit, Michigan.\nIn 1960, the Maccabees relocated to a new building in Southfield, Michigan - a suburb of Detroit.\nIn 1986, they built new 251,000-square-foot office building, also in Southfield.\n\n< life insurance (husband/father dies)\n\n>bees = Knights of the Maccabees (men)\nDrones\n\n>Who are the farmers who take the honey?\nWorker bees\n\n>Who created the Maccabees?\nThe Knights of the Maccabees was founded in London, Ontario by members of the Order of the Foresters.

The first convention was held on August 7, 1878.\n\n>Independent Order of Foresters\nThe Independent Order of Foresters is a fraternal organization, now based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and operating under the brand name Foresters Financial\n\nForesters traces its origin to a British Friendly Society, a mutual organization caring for the sick. The original Foresters groups allegedly banded together for mutual aid and protection in 14th-century England, in or near the ancient royal forests which belonged to the monarchy.[2] Although the older history cannot be proven, there was a society called the Royal Foresters in the 18th century. Membership originally was gained by combat, first with quarterstaffs, then with swords and finally with cudgels, until initiation by combat was abandoned in 1843.[3]\n\n-->The Foresters foundation principal was the \"Fatherhood of God,\" particularly as expressed in the Ten Commandments. In 1847, the Foresters choose for their motto \"Liberty, Benevolence, and Concord.\"\n-->The officers of a Court are: Court Deputy, Physician, Chief Ranger, Past Chief Ranger, Vice Chief Ranger, Organist, Recording Secretary, Financial Secretary Court Treasurer, Orator, Superintendent of Juvenile Court, Senior Woodward, Junior Woodward, Senior Beadle, Junio",

The Forest Charter of 1217 had set the titles of the various officers in charge of different aspects of the forests, all of which were royal preserves subject to oppressive laws that burdened any peasant caught hunting in them. Id. at 17.   According to Forester history, guilds and fraternities began organizing during the reign of Richard II (1377-1399) to care for the sick and alleviate suffering. (Fraternally Yours: A History of the Independent Order of Foresters, Warren Potter and Robert Oliver (Queen Anne Press Ltd., London, 1967).) Purportedly, because of the lack of justice for the poor or uninfluential, people who were refugees from justice, or the lack of justice, took to the forest in the manner Robin Hood had taken to Sherwood Forest. Id. at 17.  The earliest documented record of  a society of foresters is the 1790 formation of the first Court of the Royal Ancient Order of Foresters. Id. at 18. The claim to a medieval origin seems like a exaggerated attempt to claim parity with Freemasonry. \n\n The early 20th century Canadian Order of Forester's ritual is representative of Forestry. Perhaps as part of the Order's bid for parity with Freemasonry, the greater part of the Foresters initiatory ceremony is set in the period before David ascended to the thrown of Israel, while he was a fugitive from the wrath of King Saul: The candidate symbolically travels from Hebron to David's camp in the Wilderness while being taught the principles of Forestry - Liberty, Benevolence and Concord - and reflecting on the Fifteenth Psalm. The Officers of the Court are: Junior Chief Ranger; Chief Ranger; Vice Chief Ranger; Chaplain; Conductor; Secretary; Senior and Junior Woodwards; Senior and Junior Beadles; and Guards. In the Initiator Ceremony the Chief Ranger represents David; the Vice Chief Ranger, Joab; and the Conductor, the Priest Abiathar. If costumed during the ceremony of Initiation, The Chief and Vice Chief Rangers wore Ancient Jewish military dress; the Junior Past Chief Ranger, Hebrew Prince or Chieftain; the Chaplain and Conductor, Priests of the tabernacle; the Secretary, Levite or Scribe; the Woodwards, Beadles and Guards, Hebrew soldiers.  The emblems of the Initiatory Ceremony are the Table of Shew Bread, from which David was fed by the High Priest while a fugitive from the hatred and tyranny of King Saul, and the bow and arrows. Not until near the conclusion of the ceremony is the purported connection of the order to Robin Hood (Robert of Huntingdon) explained to the candidate by the Chief Ranger. Ritual of the Canadian Order of Foresters, Right Worthy High Court of Canada (The Examiner, Printers and Bookbinders, Peterborough, Ont., 1902).\n\n Disagreement exists as to when Courts of the Ancient Order of Foresters arrived in America. According to Ballan Stead's history of the order, Stead claims that the first court was instituted at Philadelphia with a second Court (The General Washington Court No. 1361) coming into being in 1841 at Brooklyn. Id. at 30. Supreme Chief Ranger and founder of the Order in Canada, Dr. Peter Martin Oronhyatekha (Mohawk for \"Burning Sky\"), maintained the first court was Court Brooklyn No. 4421 which was instituted in 1864. Id. at 24 and 30. The seeds of the American branches secession were sown as early as 1871 when requests for the establishment of a Subsidiary High Court were rebuffed by the High Court in England. Id. at 34. Resentment at being denied a measure of self rule rose to such discontent that by 1874 independence was proclaimed and the Independent Order of Foresters was born.\n By 1875, the emergent Independent Order of Foresters was well established and had forty-nine Courts in eleven States, with two additional courts for women working the Miriam Degree and a ritual adopted for a uniform rank which was named the Glenwood Degree. Id. at 38. Until 1879, the Independent Order of Foresters did not require a medical examination before accepting a member. Id. at 39. A Juvenile Order with the lower age limit set at twelve years old was established in 1889. Id. at 69. Until 1891, all meetings of the Supreme Court were held in Canada. Id. By 1895, there were Courts in seventeen of the United States. Id. at 74. Although women were admitted into the Foresters in the United States, the Canadian domain did not admit women until 1898. \n\nMembership grew, particularly in CA. IOF began merging with other \"fraternal benefit socieities\":  Royal Templars of Temperance, Modern Brotherhood of America, The Order of Scottish Clans.\n\nIn 1834 the Royal Foresters formed a Friendly Society, the Ancient Order of Foresters (AOF).[4] The IOF in the United States became independent of the AOF in 1874,[5] and as of 2014 operates a separate UK division, Forester Life, based in South London.",

Of Mohawk descent, born in 1841 at Six Nations near present-day Brantford, Ontario, Oronhyatekha (\"Burning Sky\") was baptized Peter Martin and later attended Oxford, where he became medical doctor. \n\n>Oronhyatekha and the Prince of Wales?\nOronhyatekha (10 August 1841 – 3 March 1907), (\"Burning Sky\" or \"Burning Cloud\" in the Mohawk language, also carried the baptismal name Peter Martin), was a Mohawk physician, scholar, and a unique figure in the history of British colonialism. He was the first known aboriginal Oxford scholar; a successful CEO of a multinational financial institution; a native statesman; an athlete of international standing; and an outspoken champion of the rights of women, children, and minorities. \n\nOronhyatekha was selected at the age of twenty by the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy (consisting of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora Nations) to give the welcoming address to the Prince of Wales during his visit to the New World.

			"body": ">>9eb4bed4-7645-43e2-8f79-3012ee2b362e\n>Who was Oronhyatekha?\nChristian name: Peter Martin\nMohawk man, highly educated (Oxford), energetic and successful in business (mltinational financial institution), a physician and  a native statesman; an athlete of international standing; and an outspoken champion of the rights of women, children, and minorities\n\nBy 1881 he had become Supreme Chief Ranger of Foresters, the organisation's international CEO, a position that he held for a record 26 years. In 1889, he moved to Toronto, where the IOF headquarters had relocated. During his tenure as SCR, he transformed the order into one of the wealthiest fraternal financial institutions in the Victorian world; today, it counts more than one-million members in North America and the European Union. Oronhyatekha was an active Orangeman and served as County Grand Master of Middlesex Country Orange Lodge\n\nHe belonged to the International Order of Good Templars, several branches of the Masonic Order, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Knights of the Maccabees, and the Orange Order. He was the Worshipful Master of Richardson Masonic Lodge in Stouffville, Ontario in 1894.\n\nIn the 1890s, he purchased an island across from Deseronto which he renamed Foresters' Island. Here, he built a second family home, an IOF meeting and dining hall, a bandstand, the Isle Hotel and cottages for guests, and a wharf at which boats from the mainland could dock. While the hotel seems to have been open for all guests, not just IOF members, he hosted huge IOF gatherings each summer to celebrate its anniversaries. \n\n[T]he one achievement of which Oronhyatekha was most proud was the enterprise his contemporaries regarded as his only significant failure. In 1904, he created an orphanage on the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, It opened for operations in 1906, and Oronhyatekha described it as his life's crowning achievement. \n\n'''APPLY:'''\nLocal man, highly educated (in England), was ''the bridge'' between various organizations internationally, bought an island for members' use, started a \"child help\" facility.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine issued a 17-point plan to address gun violence on Tuesday that includes background checks for nearly all gun purchases and a so-called “red flag” law that would allow courts to take firearms from people reported as potentially dangerous.\n\nTrump, though, has previously endorsed expanded background checks only to reverse course after hearing from the National Rifle Association, whose membership comprises an important piece of his political base.\n\nAfter a shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school in 2018 that killed 17 people, Trump publicly endorsed a host of gun-safety measures opposed by the gun-rights group, only to retreat following a private dinner with the organization’s leaders. The NRA, though, is currently experiencing leadership and financial turmoil, and it isn’t clear if it’s lobbying the White House to remain firm against any new restrictions on gun purchases.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n......................\nBy POTUS \"marrying\" gun control to a comprehensive immigration plan the Ds will never pass means there won't be moar gun control.",

Authorities said officers patrolling the area arrived on the scene and shot the gunman dead 30 seconds after the violence began.\n\nIn addition to the nine people killed, including Betts' sister, more than two dozen others were injured in the attack, which came 13 hours after a shooting spree that claimed 22 lives in El Paso, Texas.\n\n'VIOLENT IDEOLOGIES'\n\nThe assailant in Texas surrendered to police and has been charged with capital murder in what authorities are treating as a hate crime and an act of domestic terrorism. Most of the victims there were Hispanic.\n\nFederal agents have found no clues suggesting the Dayton gunman was influenced by the rampage in El Paso, said Wickerham, the agent in charge of the FBI's Cincinnati office.\n\nHowever, he said, \"the individual had a history of obsession with violent ideations, including mass shootings, and expressed a desire to commit a mass shooting.\"\n\n\"We have uncovered evidence throughout the course of our investigation that the shooter was exploring violent ideologies,\" Wickerham added.\n\nNevertheless, much remained unclear. The agent said investigators were still seeking to determine what particular ideology may have influenced the gunman, \"who, if anyone, helped him or had any advance knowledge of his intentions to conduct this attack, and why he committed this specific act of violence.\"\n\nWickerham also echoed previous statements by the city's police chief, Richard Biehl, that there was no indication so far that the shooting spree was racially motivated, even though six of the nine dead were African-American.\n\nAuthorities have previously said Betts was known to have been a troubled youth in high school, at one point drawing up a \"hit list\" of students he wanted to kill or otherwise harm.\n\nThe Dayton Daily News, citing the recollections of former classmates, reported that Betts had been suspended from high school, and detained by police, over the hit list. But it said Bellbrook police said it had no record of such an incident.\n",

They would sever ties months later as new accusations of sexual abuse were levied against the financier, while weeks later the now-defunct Webstie Gawker published his \"little black book\" containing over 1,000 names of prominent individuals and their contacts. \n\n    Within months of the Bequia sailing from Little St. James, Staley cut ties to Epstein, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The banker was in the running for the top job at Barclays, a position that required interviews and approvals by U.K. regulators. The wisdom of breaking from Epstein became apparent when the British press reported on their relationship. -Bloomberg\n\nWhile not accused of participating in any of Epstein's illegal activities, Staley - who visited Epstein at his Palm Beach office while the Epstein was on prison work-release, has come under fire by those who want to know exactly how close the two were. By all accounts, Epstein played a pivotal role in Staley's rise while running JP Morgan's private bank - referring wealthy clients to the banker and helping to arrange the bank's 2004 acquisition of Highbridge Capital Management. \n\nStaley left JPMorgan in 2013 before joining hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management. In December 2015 joined Barclays as CEO.\n\n    Going back about two decades, Epstein regularly brought Staley business when he ran JPMorgan’s private bank and the two were close professionally, according to a person familiar with the matter. One of those introductions Epstein made was to hedge fund billionaire Glenn Dubin, the New York Times reported. -Bloomberg\n\nStaley aside, Epstein somehow managed to maintain his relationships on Wall Street despite his sex-offender pedophile lifestyle, including billionaire Leon Black, former Israeli Prime Minister (and current candidate for the job) Ehud Barak - and was able to secure preferable stock allocations in dozens of IPOs. Via Bloomberg: \n\n    Apollo Global Management’s Black met with Epstein at the company’s New York offices. Black dispatched Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan to attend a meeting at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion with representatives of Edmond de Rothschild Group to discuss how the two firms could work together more closely, people with knowledge of the meeting said. Florence Gaubert, a spokeswoman for Edmond de Rothschild, said she wasn’t aware of any meeting and that the bank has no business links with Apollo or Epstein.\n    BV70 LLC, a charity controlled by Black, donated $10 million to Epstein’s foundation Gratitude America, even as the New York Attorney General’s Office questioned whether another of Epstein’s foundations was complying with state registration requirements.\n    Epstein invested in a partnership started in 2015 by Barak, prime minister from 1999 to 2001, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein's travel became far more frequent in 2015 - as he flew between New York, the US Virgin Islands, New Mexico (where he owns a compound), and Paris. \n\nIn 2017, filings for Epstein's Gratitude America charity reveal investment income of $899,417 from 52 trades - most of which involved IPOs. Clearly nobody had a problem associating with the pedophile or his money. \n\n\"The IPO trading is evidence of Mr. Epstein’s level of access to the offerings,\" said Jacob Frenkel, chair of government investigations and securities enforcement at Dickinson Wright.\n\nEnter the Miami Herald\n\nIn 2018, Epstein became truly radioactive after the Miami Herald published a series of reports beginning in November - titled Perversion of Justice. Not only did the Herald catalogue Epstein's many accusers - the series focused on the sweetheart deal he was given by former Trump Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta despite dozens of accusers levying claims. Acosta resigned last month amid the controversy. \n\nMeanwhile, Deutsche Bank fired Epstein as a client earlier this year, and has been actively assisting the case against him, according to court filings. \n",

Here’s why we can’t.\nBy Alyssa Rosenberg Opinion writer\nAugust 7 at 5:32 PM\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/07/qanon-isnt-just-conspiracy-theory-its-highly-effective-game/\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190808014733/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/07/qanon-isnt-just-conspiracy-theory-its-highly-effective-game/\n\n“It is addictive in the same way that a game is,” says Travis View, a researcher who studies QAnon. By contrast, “conventional political participation” is oriented toward far more mundane processes, and “That all has the impact of what, hopefully getting a state assembly member elected that you feel at best ambivalent about?” View suggests that “Q offers something a hell of a lot more. You can sit at your computer and search for information and then post about what you find, and Q basically promises that through this process, you are going to radically change the country, institute this incredible, almost bloodless revolution, and then be part of this historical movement that will be written about for generations.”\n>terrified that this is true and all their plans come crashing down around them, ashes people will only remember with spite and derision\n\nThis promise of world-historical significance also justifies the time that QAnon believers spend deciphering posts and promoting Q. Even as the game-like qualities of QAnon draw in believers, ''they vigorously deny that they are participants in live-action role play:'' After all, if they were, why would the media and the government pay so much attention to them?\n>skips of actual obvious answer\n\nIt’s one thing to try to debunk QAnon and white-supremacist ideas, whether by trying to prove that John F. Kennedy Jr. is definitively dead or to combat demographic narratives of “replacement.” It’s quite another to figure out how to offer adherents of QAnon and other distorted worldviews experiences that will be as thrilling and fulfilling as conspiracy games have become. As View put it, we’re living not in a marketplace of ideas but in a “marketplace of realities.” And the tools of gaming have given disaffected people the ability to bend our reality to theirs, whether we like it or not.\n>oh fuck they're doing it, we're losing control of the peasants!\n",

But one cannot help but stare at a train wreck.\n\nAnd the article, titled “Black families once lived off their southern farmland. Their descendants are struggling to hold onto it,” is certainly a glorious train wreck. It contains 15 separate corrections. The list of errors is almost as long as the article itself, clocking in at an impressive 579 words.\n\nThe very first thing the reader sees when he goes to the article are the following lines: “Corrections: A previous version of this article contained many errors and omitted context and allegations important to understanding two families’ stories.

According to the official, the U.S. is looking for ways to mitigate China’s ability to “glean from that activity” once it begins operating the port in 2021.\n\n“It’s a work in progress. We woke up late to the problem. We didn’t take the opportunity to bid on the Haifa project when that was open and that was a mistake,” the official said. “And now we can continually work with our Israeli colleagues to mitigate any issues that may have slipped under the bridge so far and to prevent future ones.”\n\nHe said that any regulatory mechanism should monitor in particular technology and critical infrastructure investments. “You’ll certainly be looking at '''things like 5G,''' that we would in consultation going forward continually could review and redefine what counts as a sensitive technology, as it’s constantly changing.”\n\nThe official remained optimistic about Israel’s willingness to implement supervision, and credited the close relationship between the Netanyahu government and the Trump administration.\n\n“We’ve been very encouraged by the responsiveness of the Israelis,” the official added. “It’s difficult, it’s a process. I’m not saying that this is an easy walk in the park. But I think that the Israelis understand the nature of the problem and the necessity of getting it resolved.”\n.....................\nUse up the US and then go on to another host country; if Israel uses Chinese 5G, then US would have to stop sharing intel with them, to be consistent with the policy across the board.",

The researchers believe the vulnerabilities are \"of the utmost importance and require attention.\"\n\nSee also: LokiBot malware now hides its source code in image files\n\nThere are three methods of attack which exploit the problems. The first allows hackers to use the \"quote\" feature in a group conversation to change the identity of a sender -- even if that person has not participated in a group chat. \n\nThe second is the alteration of a reply, which the researchers describe as \"essentially putting words in [a contact's] mouth.\"\n\nThe third is the sending of a 'private' message to another group participant which is actually masked as a public message, and so when responded to, everyone in a conversation can see the content. \n\nCheck Point attempted to reverse WhatsApp's algorithm to decrypt data and communication. The team was then able to see the parameters sent between the desktop and mobile version of the platform, and this information allowed them to develop the tool and conduct the attacks. \n\nFull technical details of the decryption and spoofing tool, as well as possible attack vectors, can be found in Check Point's blog post.\n........................\nTrying to get out in front of some damning news?

Wexner would only say some of the funds Epstein had taken were actually returned.\n\n“This was, frankly, a tremendous shock, even though it clearly pales in comparison to the unthinkable allegations against him now,” Wexner wrote today. “All of that money — every dollar of it — was originally Wexner family money.”\n\nEpstein was also deeply involved in handling the funds for Wexner’s other charitable endeavors, including his organizations Arts Interests, Health and Science Interests, International Charitable Interests, and The Wexner Children’s Trust.\n\n<SNIP>\n\nWexner, whose company's brands include Bath & Body Works and Pink, claimed in his letter he had trusted Epstein with so much of his money because others had “vouched for and recommended him as a knowledgeable financial professional.”\n\n“I am embarrassed that, like so many others, I was deceived by Mr. Epstein,” Wexner said. “I know now that my trust in him was grossly misplaced and I deeply regret having ever crossed his path.”\n\nThe business relationship between Wexner and Epstein extended across two decades. By 1991, Epstein had obtained power-of-attorney over many of Wexner’s business ventures and nonprofits. Though Epstein bragged he only took billionaire clients, Wexner is his only known billionaire client. Epstein reportedly made hundreds of millions of dollars through his relationship with Wexner before their relationship went south.\n\nWexner said the alleged deception was revealed when he started to disentangle himself from Epstein following allegations against Epstein of sexual abuse more than a decade ago. Wexner says he confronted Epstein about the accusations but Epstein “vehemently denied” them.\n\n<SNIP>\nMoar info about Wexner/Epstein relationship & excuses at original article.

The left is angry that a Trump-supporter would dare to visit Baltimore and help improve the situation\n\n    .@baltsunopinion: Whatever he says his motives were, Scott Presler’s presence in Baltimore reinforces the tired image that the poor people in this city can’t take care of their own neighborhoods. https://t.co/EleeVh4ZPm\n    — The Baltimore Sun (@baltimoresun) August 6, 2019\n\nPresler was quick to reply:\n\n    \"I can't even imagine what would cause a person to be mad at us for helping to clean up Baltimore.\n\n    Instead of criticizing us, how about putting on some gloves to pick up trash\"\n\n*  *  *\n\nAs we deatiled earlier, hundreds of MAGA supporters participated in a massive cleanup effort earlier this week in West Baltimore, inspired by President Trump's tweets, along with a conservative activist who organized the event in Rep. Elijah Cummings' district.\n\nAccording to WBAL-TV Baltimore, 300 volunteers on Aug. 5 took to the streets of northwest Baltimore, cleaning up trash from alleyways in an \"Americans Helping Americans\" event organized by conservative activist Scott Presler.\n\nStarting at 7 am at the intersection of North Fulton Avenue and Westwood Avenue (highest per capita homicide rate in the country), hundreds gathered to lend a hand in \"Making Baltimore Great Again.\" About 12 hours later, volunteers collected more than 12 tons of trash, almost 1 ton per hour, in a massive cleanup effort in hopes to revive the dying city.\n\nMany of the volunteers were from other states, such as Ohio, and North Carolina, and most of them traveled from abroad because they heard about the cleanup effort on Presler's social media channels.\n\n    \"I never intended it to turn into a national event.

The site was allegedly used by a man charged with the killings of 20 people and injuring 26 in a rampage in El Paso, Texas, last week.\n\n“The first thing we want to know is the influence of 8chan in the Philippines,” Lt. Col. Elpidio Ramirez, chief investigating officer in the case, said in an interview.\n>kek, yes every single flip is on 8ch!!!\n\nMr. Ramirez said police had sought cooperation from Mr. Watkins and 8chan’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, who also resides in the country. '''The scope of the investigation focuses on 8chan’s influence in the Philippines''' and was triggered after the site was linked to the El Paso shooting. Authorities are operating independently from a separate inquiry in the U.S., Mr. Ramirez said.\n\nDoes that even make any sense? How influential 8ch is in the Philippines?!?\nOf course not, but that's the public initial angle (we're doing something!!!)\n\nWhat other sites are reporting as the reason for the investigation:\n==8chan Owner Jim Watkins Facing Summons to Testify Before Congress, Child Porn Probe in Philippines==\nTom McKay Tuesday 10:25pm\nhttps://gizmodo.com/8chan-owner-jim-watkins-facing-summons-to-testify-befor-1837017839\nhttps://archive.fo/0Dvk0\nHowever, according to Wired, Cybercrime Division at the Philippines’ National Bureau of Investigation chief Victor Lorenzo said that his agency is looking into 8chan—which has long insisted it is subject only to U.S. law because its data center is located there—and N.T. Technology after hearing from his American counterparts. ''While Lorenzo said he was concerned about the site’s role in spreading violence, he also said that his agency is investigating whether 8chan’s role in facilitating the spread of child pornography violates the Anti-Child Pornography Act.''\n\n“Considering that the Philippines was tapped as the epicenter of child pornography materials, we are interested in this issue,” Lorenzo told Wired. “If you are going to visit his site, he is actually trying to promote, or catering to, child pornography, and it is a serious offense here... Considering that the registration is here, we have jurisdiction.”\n.........................\nWe are ALL against cp, but that's the angle that they are taking against Jim Watkins & 8ch.",

As a result, we've removed them from our platform. We've also made a product change that should help prevent other companies from scraping public location pages in this way,\" said an Instagram spokesperson, following a Wednesday cease-and-desist letter sent to the Hyp3r. \n\n    The existence of the profiles is a stark indication that more than a year after revelations that Facebook users' data was exploited by Cambridge Analytica to fuel divisive political ad campaigns, Facebook's struggles in locking down users' personal information not only persist but also extend beyond the core Facebook app. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook but operated as a mostly separate business, has been largely insulated from the privacy backlash and scrutiny that has rocked its parent company.\n\n    But the wealth of the data contained in people's fleeting Instagram activity, from family-vacation snapshots to restaurant appetizer photos, can provide valuable fodder for a variety of outside actors, who can repurpose the information in ways users never expected or agreed to. -Business Insider\n\nWhile the amount of data Hyp3r scraped is currently unknown, the firm has publicly bragged about having \"a unique dataset of hundreds of millions of the highest value consumers in the world,\" of which more than 90% is sourced from 1 million+ Instagram posts per month, according to the report. \n\n     Hyp3r made unauthorized use of Instagram data in three key ways:\n\n        It took advantage of an Instagram security lapse, allowing it to zero in on specific locations, like hotels and gyms, and vacuum up all the public posts made from the locations.\n        At these locations, it systematically saved users' public Instagram stories — a type of content designed to vanish after 24 hours —including the individual photos that users shared in the stories, in a clear violation of Instagram's terms of service.\n        It scraped public user profiles on a broad basis, collecting information like user bios and followers, which it then combined with the other location information and data from other sources. -Business Insider\n\nFurthermore, Hyp3r uses image-recognition software to determine what users are depicting. \ncont'd\n.........................\n>then they should have no problem with getting the info of the El Paso shooter's info, since he uploaded his \"manifesto\" to IG first...\n",

Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri said in a statement.\n\n\"White nationalists time and time again have used the exact language of this President to condone their violence against immigrants, Muslims, and other minorities,\" said Cleaver, 74, a former Kansas City mayor and ordained United Methodist pastor. \"If the President truly wants to stamp out these extremists, then I call on him and his administration to label these white supremacist groups, investigate them, and name the El Paso shooter exactly what he is: a terrorist.\"\n\nThe president has repeatedly denounced white nationalism but Democrats blame him for incidents linked to the movement, including the El Paso, Texas shooting, which claimed 22 lives.\n\nCleaver made the request in a letter sent Thursday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nCleaver asked the Treasury Department to label the El Paso shooter a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist.”\n\nCleaver said far-right extremism is increasing in the United States and noted testimony in July by FBI Director Christopher Wray that white supremacy is behind a rise in domestic terrorism.\n\n\"The growing threat of white nationalist violent extremism can no longer be ignored,” Cleaver said in a statement. “As the leader of the nation and all Americans, it is incumbent on the President to protect Muslims, Jews, immigrants, and other minorities from white nationalists,\" he said. \"By formally labeling this individual a terrorist, it allows the Treasury, State, and Justice Departments to use the full set of tools at their disposal to attack this problem head on, which is exactly what this President should be doing.”\n.............................\n\nSo, we're now at the point of creating \"lists\" of POTENTIAL \"white nationalists.\"\n1) They would have to define the term, and \n2) it's not illegal to have unorthodox thoughts\nThe muddying already exists: you are a \"racist\" if you don't hate yourself for being white, no hatred of others is even necessary.\nThis is the future they want, but they are not going to get.

			"body": "==Getting Rid of 8chan Isn't Going to Get Rid of QAnon==\n'''Some longtime watchers of the conspiracy say it's grown to the point where it doesn't need 8chan or even Q anymore.'''\nby Mack Lamoureux\nAug 8 2019, 3:49pm\nhttps://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/qvg4jx/getting-rid-of-8chan-isnt-going-to-get-rid-of-qanon\nhttps://archive.fo/8ZxZU\n\nThe incidental deplatforming of 8chan has not dealt QAnon a fatal blow. The many followers of the conspiracy, similar to the YouTube vlogger mentioned above, aren't going to let anything—even their main figure going away—stop them. \n\nQAnon supporters are \"frustrated at best,\" Travis View, a co-host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast, told VICE. \"They've been trained to believe that everything that happens is part of the 'plan' so they are able to roll without [8chan] for the moment.\"\n\nLike a child taking off their training wheels, View believes the group has grown past the need for Q. \"Ultimately, the QAnon community doesn't need Q,\" he said. \"Even if Q went dark, they would still spin new conspiracy theories with the framework and thought-terminating cliches (like 'trust the plan') that Q has provided them.\"\n\nThe \"trust the plan\" mantra can be found in almost all the content posted by both the true QAnon adherents and the grifters who have climbed onto the movement. ''When Q disappeared for weeks before, it was the same—the followers never lost their faith.''\n\nRick Ross, a cult expert, told VICE for a previous story about QAnon that the community bears the hallmarks of a cult. And because it's unfolding online, it becomes hard to penetrate. Followers \"spend all their watching time Q material on YouTube, dialoguing with different people online, and becoming consumed by that world online,\" Ross said. Even if Q goes away, that community will still exist.\n\n__Mike Rothschild__,a freelance journalist who has written extensively on QAnon, told VICE he interviewed several Q followers who told him that \"even if Q never posted again, they had more than enough to work from.\" Several QAnon followers who spoke to VICE reiterated this notion, with one follower saying, \"We carry on despite any and all setbacks.\"\n\n''Rothschild doesn't believe that 8chan is gone for good but even if it is and Q never posts again he believes the movement will carry on''. \"Q followers are too far gone and too invested to walk away from the movement,\" Rothschild said. \"Many have lost families and friends over this, and Q is a large part of their identity. They will still believe in Q, even if Q never makes another drop.\"\n\nA recent video posted by View on Twitter and retweeted widely shows a woman talking about what QAnon means to her. \"Q is you and Q is me. Q is logic. Q is a plan to save the world,\" the woman said. \"Q is not a secret but Q is secretive. A carefully crafted secret education that anyone can have access to.\"\n\nMany online have commented on the video's quasi-religious nature, including Rothschild who says he believes Q is \"evolving from a conspiracy theory into a religion.\"\n\n\"The Q community's reaction to periods of silence from Q is proof of that,\" Rothschild said. \"They still believe, still research, still make memes, and still wait for 'the storm' to come, even through long absences and disconfirmations.\"\n\n''QAnon has grown bigger than Q and there may be no putting this modern monster back in the box.'' As Views puts it, the absence of a leader doesn’t always mean the end of a movement.\n\n“After all, the fact that Paul the Apostle hasn't written any new material in a while didn't stop the growth of Christianity.\"\n\n",

I think Twitter, Google (and by Google I actually mean Alphabet), and Facebook are profoundly evil corporations that epitomize Lord Acton’s admonition, “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” They have eluded liability under the safe harbor provision of the Communications Decency Act and ruthlessly targeted conservative voices they think are hitting too close to home. They have even blocked the parody site Babylon Bee because the jokes were too close to being actual news.\nThey have branched out from merely ripping off your personal information and selling it for a profit to actively interfering in the politics of the United States. A prime example of this is the decision by Twitter to suspend the Twitter account of Mitch McConnell’s reelection campaign for encouraging violence when it tweeted a video of leftwing wackos, at least one of which appeared to be very chummy with Elizabeth “Ol’ 1/1024” Warren, at McConnell’s home shouting obscenities and threats of physical harm. This behavior is not new. During the 2018 campaign, Facebook pulled ads by Elizabeth Heng because she made reference to the fact that her parents had escaped from the Khmer Rouge genocide.\nIn short, I’m 100% in favor of the Department of Justice’s Anti-Trust Division putting them out of business. I’m in favor of sending as much of their staff to prison and homeless shelters as can be done legally.\n<snip>\nThough 8chan and Gab represent an extreme example, they provide a good model for why creating a social media network that allows free speech within the constraints of what is legally permissible rather than what is socially acceptable to a 26 year-old gay trans woke hipster in a long-term relationship with xis gerbil (NTTAWWT) is simply not possible. 8chan was shut off from internet access by a vendor. Not by market forces. By a vendor. A new vendor was found. The new vendor was shut down by one of its vendors for providing services to 8chan. There was a time when this might have been called “restraint of trade” but if you say the wrong thing, then no one cares.\nIf you think this can’t happen to conservatives, you’re delusional. Look at how the concept of “white supremacy” has been broadened to include all of Donald Trump’s supporters and donors:\n\n    \"For those of you funding Donald Trump's re-election campaign, you may want to take note: Because you keep writing checks to this president, it's on you…because you are funding this white supremacist campaign…It is your money that is funding this white supremacy.\" —@JoeNBC pic.twitter.com/w0kxC0KJAk\n    — Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) August 5, 2019\n\n    Moments ago on @DeadlineWH:\n    .@jacobsoboroff: \"Is the president a white supremacist?\"\n    Beto O'Rourke: \"He is.\"pic.twitter.com/zZZNQRnRox\n    — 11th Hour (@11thHour) August 7, 2019\n\nYou, my friend, are a white supremacist to these people. And your right to political speech is just as endangered by Vichy Republicans as it is by the left.\nIn this case, 8chan needed a service vendor to allow it to operate on the internet. That vendor walked. The replacement vendor was dependent upon a third party for leased servers and they were shut down because they provided a service to 8chan.\nThe fact is that in the current environment, you can’t start a competing social media network that allows opinions that the left finds offensive unless you have the financial wherewithal to own, outright, all the hardware, software, and can provide all the necessary services to keep that network online if Big Tech disapproves of what you’re doing.\nAnd, if you can, how do you stay in business? Who controls most of the internet advertising sales? And if an internet service company can be shut down because of its unpopular client, how many companies will permit their ads to appear on your network after Google warns them off?\nNo, my friends, there are two ways forward. Either we comply with situationally malleable rules designed to shut us down and accept our role as serfs or we use every tool at our disposal to either tame or destroy these corporations which are literally trying to rule the country.",

Critics have insisted there is little evidence to substantiate those claims beyond individual anecdotes.\n\n    \"Twitter’s hostile actions toward Leader McConnell’s campaign are outrageous and we will not tolerate it,\" Jesse Hunt, a spokesman with the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n    \"The NRSC will suspend all spending with Twitter until further notice. We will not spend our resources on a platform that silences conservatives.\"\n\n*  *  *\n\nAuthored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,\n\nIt appears that President Trump is getting ready to bring down the hammer on the big social media companies.\n\nAccording to Politico, the Trump administration is in the process of drafting an executive order that will “tackle Silicon Valley’s alleged anti-conservative bias”.  And it is very much in President Trump’s own self-interest to do this.  Social media played a key role in helping him win in 2016, but since that time we have seen an unprecedented wave of censorship on the major social media platforms, and most of that censorship has been directed at conservative voices.  If President Trump doesn’t do something, it is hard to see how he will win in 2020, and of course that is precisely what the leftist executives at the big social media companies want.\n\nUltimately, it would take an act of Congress to do everything that needs to be done, but President Trump should be applauded for trying to do what he can on his own.  Apparently Politico was able to speak to three separate sources that are familiar with the drafting of this new executive order, and after speaking to all of them Politico came to the conclusion that the Trump administration is very serious about “wielding the federal government’s power against Silicon Valley”…\n\n    The White House is circulating drafts of a proposed executive order that would address allegations of anti-conservative bias by social media companies, according to a White House official and two other people familiar with the matter — a month after President Donald Trump pledged to explore “all regulatory and legislative solutions” on the issue.\n\n    None of the three would describe the contents of the order, which one person cautioned has already taken many different forms and remains in flux. But its existence, and the deliberations surrounding it, are evidence that the administration is taking a serious look at wielding the federal government’s power against Silicon Valley.\n\nIt is not clear if such an executive order would hold up in court, and undoubtedly there will be legal challenges right away.  Of course those legal challenges will take a long time to play out, because we all know how quickly our legal system moves.\n<snip>\nIn the end, it is very simple.  The leftists that run the big social media companies hate what we believe, and they don’t want us to get the truth out.  The don’t believe in a free marketplace of ideas, because their ideas always lose.\n\nSo the only way that they can win is by shutting us up, and that is precisely what they have been attempting to do.\n\nThe social media giants built multi-billion dollar empires by giving everyone a voice, but now that they have such a dominant position on the Internet they have decided that many prominent conservative voices should be completely silenced.\n\nThey want to control what ideas people are exposed to, thus shaping the overall direction of the country as a whole.\n\nIf they are allowed to get away with it, they will greatly alter the political future of America far beyond the 2020 election.\n\nSomething needs to be done immediately, and so let us hope that President Trump gives this executive order some really strong teeth.\n",

Combined, Facebook and Alphabet Inc. ’s Google earned 60% of all digital advertising revenue in the U.S. last year, according to eMarketer.\nThe news-licensing deals between Facebook and news outlets would run for three years, some of the people said.

Roughly 63 percent of black Americans and 61 percent of Hispanic Americans said they would be more likely to support an anti-illegal immigration presidential candidate.\n\nMore than seven-in-ten working and lower-middle-class Americans, as well as 71 percent of suburban voters, said the same.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the Harvard/Harris Poll found that nearly seven-in-ten swing voters, along with 64 percent of all U.S. voters, said they are less likely to support a 2020 presidential candidate who supports more immigration to the country.\n\nThe Washington, DC-imposed mass immigration policy — whereby more than 1.5 million mostly low-skilled foreign workers are admitted to the U.S. to compete against Americans every year — has been a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational conglomerates, as every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an occupation’s labor force reduces Americans’ hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans’ overall wages by 0.8 percent.\n\nCurrently, there are anywhere between 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living across the country, the majority of which live in California, New York, Florida, and Texas.\n\nThe poll surveyed 2,214 registered American voters online between July 31 and August 1.",

Binney says that President Donald Trump is being framed and that we the people are subjected to the constant surveillance and tracking authoritarian regimes are known for.\n\nListening to Binney speak with Michelle Holliday with Portfolio Wealth Global.com, it sure seems like there is little we can do.\n\nIn this interview, Binney horrifyingly describes how his former employer, the government agency known for it’s spying, has built a massive system to track, monitor and record phone and Internet communications of U.S. citizens and other people around the world. Binney resigned from the National Security Agency in 2001 to protest the growing domestic mass surveillance and privacy violations. He was a senior NSA crypto-mathematician largely responsible for automating the agency’s worldwide eavesdropping network. He was one of the two co-founders of the agency’s Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center.\n\n>“[Former Vice President Dick] Cheney wanted to know everything about everybody that could possibly be a political issue,” said Binney.\n>“Stellar Wind is the spying program on everybody in the United States,” and it all began right after 9/11.  Americans are now under 24-hours per day surveillance by their own government. \n\n>“If you become a target, the implication is, they will retroactively analyze every phone call, every email, every financial transaction, everything electronic that you’ve ever done. And like for example in the case of Elliot Spitzer, when he was going after the bankers for defrauding people in the 2007/2008 financial crisis, he was actually going to criminally prosecute them. They [elitists] had to protect their bankers so they had to get rid of Elliot Spitzer. So what was the cause for Elliot Spitzer to be investigated? There wasn’t any, ok?

He is not making light of drug cartels.\n\nYou would think otherwise, though, based on recent reporting.\n\n“Mitch McConnell wants to raise money off the nickname ‘Cocaine Mitch.’ Yes, really,” the Washington Post tut-tutted in a headline.\n\nThe article itself includes quotes from experts whose opinion amounts to: That is not funny.\n\n“McConnell Fundraising With ‘Cocaine Mitch’ Shirts in Kentucky, State With Third-Highest OD Rate,\" reported New York magazine’s Intelligencer.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nHere is the backstory to these scolding headlines: Failed West Virginia senatorial candidate Don Blankenship in 2018 attacked McConnell's family. In one ad, the then-GOP candidate said, “One of my goals as U.S. senator will be to ditch Cocaine Mitch.” A second ad saw Blankenship say, “Swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people. While doing so, Mitch has gotten rich. In fact, his China family has given him tens of millions of dollars.”\n\nBy “China family,” he means McConnell’s wife, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao.\n\nThe second ad concludes: “[We'll] ditch Cocaine Mitch for the sake of the kids.”\n\nThe “cocaine” storyline dates back to 2014. Back then, Colombian officials discovered cocaine aboard a bulk carrier in the service of a New York shipping company. The shipping company belongs to Chao’s family. Not McConnell or ever Elaine Chao herself. Her family. That is the entire basis for Blankenship’s “Cocaine Mitch” nickname. The “China family” stuff was racist icing on the stupid cake.\n\nThe senator’s campaign has since appropriated Blankenship's idiocy for its own purposes. It now markets products that say \"Cocaine Mitch,\" turning a smear campaign into a positive. Smart. Embracing an attack or an insult is one of the surest ways to kneecap an assailant. If that assailant also happens to be a weird racist, even better.\n\nIf you can believe it, though, members of the press have taken offense to the “Cocaine Mitch” campaign swag. \n\nWhile McConnell’s “campaign was high-fiving supporters, drug policy experts said McConnell downplayed the drug-addiction crisis in the nation, which is particularly acute in his state,” the Washington Post said this week in the trolliest of concern trolls.\n\nIt adds, “And that story line of McConnell’s perceived insensitivity is what made it into the national press.”\n\nMy, did that storyline get \"into the national press\" all by itself?\n\n“The Bluegrass State had the nation’s fifth-highest age-adjusted drug overdose death rate in 2017, according to federal data,” the Courier-Journal added on an even more somber note. “That year 1,566 Kentuckians, or 37.2 people per 100,000, died of drug overdose, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.”\n\nIt added, “The Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy attributed 51 of those deaths to cocaine.”\n\n“[S]ome are speaking out against the shirts, suggesting they are inappropriate or hypocritical,” said ABC News. More than half of the report is dedicated to giving the senator’s critics a platform.\n\nSpare me the fake concern.\n\nImagine taking this tone when President Barack Obama joked about birtherism. Imagine accusing Obama of making light of racism. Imagine quoting \"experts\" who say Obama's jokes come even as people of color suffer every day.\n\nMcConnell's family faced dumb, racist attacks in 2018. He is laughing it off now. Good for him. Journalists should do their jobs and leave the scolding to Democratic partisans.\n",

The majority of the unsealing will be performed by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska on remand, but make no mistake, this is quite a flood today.\n— Adam Klasfeld (@KlasfeldReports) August 9, 2019\n\nThe document release stems from a 2015 defamation lawsuit in New York brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre against Epstein's 'Madam' - Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre says Maxwell helped Epstein traffic herself and other underage girls to sex parties at the billionaire pedophile's many residences. \nThe case was settled in 2017 and the records were sealed - leading to an appeal by filmmaker and author Mike Cernovich, who was later joined by the Miami Herald and several other parties including lawyer Alan Dershowitz - who has sought to clear his name in connection with Epstein's activities. \n>This appears to be the email that Alan Dershowitz asserts exonerates him from the allegations.\n\nMail on Sunday reporter apparently writing to Giuffre about Dershowitz: \n>\"We all suspect Alan is a pedo and tho no proof of that, you probably met him when he was hanging [o]ut w JE.\" pic.twitter.com/K4WPAflZ99\n— Adam Klasfeld (@KlasfeldReports) August 9, 2019\n\nWhile Epstein's ties to former President Bill Clinton and other famous figures are well known, much has been made about the relationship between President Trump and the pedophile financier. \nUpon being questioned over the accuracy of a 2011 article by journalist Sharon Churcher claiming that Donald Trump was a \"good friend of Jeffrey's,\" Guiffre was asked to clarify Churcher's possible misquoting that \"Donald Trump was also a good friend of Jeffrey's,\" and that Trump \"Didn't partake in any\" of -- \"any sex with any of us but he flirted with me.\" \n\"It's true that he didn't partake in any sex with us, and but it's not true that he flirted with me.

Ultimately it decided to stop providing its services to the site, leaving 8chan vulnerable to crippling cyberattacks. Cloudlfare’s chief executive, Matthew Prince, wrote that 8chan’s “lawlessness” had “contributed to multiple horrific tragedies.”\n\nIf 8chan was a mole, it was whacked.\n\nSo the site used Epik, another infrastructure company. The mole re-emerged! Briefly. Voxility, a company that provides computing services to Epik, was criticized for helping to support 8chan, so it dumped Epik, indirectly whacking 8chan again.\n\nWhat now? Well, someone will almost certainly give 8chan a new lease of life. That might be on a crummy server in Russia, or elsewhere.\n\nEven so, it may not come back full throttle. Leaders of the House Homeland Security Committee have called on Jim Watkins, the owner of 8chan, to “provide testimony regarding 8chan’s efforts to investigate and mitigate the proliferation of extremist content.” So it’s possible that 8chan may yet see its hyper-free-speech sensibilities crimped, at least a little.\n\nIf that happens, it’s likely to drive a hard core of alt-right users elsewhere. That’s clearly not as easy as it once was, but an 8chan alternative could surface.\n\nAnother possibility: “These kinds of communications could move into encrypted environments,” like Telegram or WhatsApp, said Andrew Sullivan, the president and chief executive of the Internet Society, a global nonprofit. “What happens then is you can’t whack the mole, because the mole doesn’t come out of the hole.”\n\nSuch marginalization “could reduce the reach of these communities,” said Rasmus Nielsen, a professor of political communication at Oxford University. But “it could increase cohesion inside the hard core,” he added. It’s hard to know what might be the dominant force.\n\nAll told, the takedowns have created immense uncertainty. And that raises a profound question: '''Who should be making such big decisions about what stays online?'''",

This is probably still appropriate given 8Chan's record, he said.\n\"I'm as uncomfortable as they [Spark] are about it. They do really need to find a new way to manage hate-speech and extremist content on the internet,\" he said.\nHe said the situation was an unusual one for Spark - a commercial entity - to find itself in.\n'''\"It's much like the Telecom of old to decide which phone calls you can and can't make,\" he said.'''\nIn a statement Spark called for the government's help.\n\"Appropriate agencies of government should put in place a robust policy framework to address the important issues surrounding such material being distributed online and freely available.\n\"But in the absence right now of such a policy framework . . . '''we believe the right thing to do right now is for us to block access to 8chan.'''\"\nMr Breslin said ''the risk was someone would now turn around and say 'okay you blocked 8Chan because of hate speech, now I want you to block this other website because it allows people to access something else.' It might be hate speech, it might be pornography, it might be something that speaks out against a religious group or ethnicity.''\n\"You start down a certain track of Spark or any of the other ISPs being forced to decide what is and isn't acceptable for the NZ public and that's not their job at all. They really shouldn't be doing that.\n\"That's the job for the public of New Zealand to decide this is acceptable, this is not, these are the people who are responsible that these are the standards and these are reinforced through our laws.\" he says.\nHe said the government needed to make a decision about who should be regulating.\n\"The government should be mandating some entity, presumably the chief censor's office, to oversee this kind of content. Having your ISP, a commercial body, to decide what you can and can't watch, is really not ideal. In the ideal world we would have a nationwide standard and this would be applicable, you could appeal, there'd be a process.\n\"None of that's in place at the moment. In effect, we're relying on Spark and the other ISPs to do the right thing, and that's always a very difficult spot for any company to find themselves in,\" Mr Breslin said.",

			"body": "==Why deplatforming 8chan '''can be effective==\nEvidence shows that banning hate sites reduces their reach'''\nBy Casey Newton @CaseyNewton Aug 8, 2019, 6:00am EDT \nhttps://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/8/8/20759995/8chan-deplatforming-extremism-white-house-censorship\nhttps://archive.fo/co9Y8\n\nWhile politicians trade press releases on the subject, the practical fate of hate-promoting tech platforms has fallen to the invisible hand of the marketplace. Over the past 72 hours, we’ve seen 8chan go down, come back, and go down again, as various internet infrastructure companies learn of the site’s existence and chase it off their customer rolls. (Its current status is: up? I think?)\n\nMost people I know assume the site will eventually find stable service providers somewhere. But that has led to a debate: does kicking 8chan off any individual service provider make the world a better place, or not?\n\nDoes deplatforming down help, or doesn’t it? Will Oremus calls the move “better than nothing” but still finds it ineffective:\n>he inability of any single private internet company to kill a website means that deplatforming is a battle in which victories tend to be short-lived. And that’s leaving aside the harder question of whether it really works, in the sense of not just blacklisting a given person or domain, but actually limiting the virulent spread of their ideology.\nAnd yet, we now have good evidence that forcing hate figures and their websites to continuously relocate is effective at diminishing their reach over time. Angela Chen explains why:\n>After a group of tech companies kicked InfoWars founder Alex Jones off their platforms, initial interest in him spiked, but a year later, he had mostly disappeared. One 2017 study found that Reddit’s decision to ban communities like r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown led to less hate speech on the site, says study coauthor Eshwar Chandrasekharan, a PhD candidate at Georgia Tech. The reason: extremely motivated users will follow a community or personality to a new place, but less-engaged members drop off completely.\n>Similarly, the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer used to be a central organizing space for the far right. Since it was dropped by web-hosting company GoDaddy two years ago, its influence within the movement has significantly waned, says Becca Lewis, a researcher who studies online political subcultures. “If 8chan stays down, there’s reason to believe that that would have a big impact on what we see in terms of online organizing in the far-right movement,” she adds. \n\nThat’s good enough for me. I’d rather that Congress pass gun control, but I’ll take the deplatforming of 8chan in the meantime.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Thompson offers a useful framework for '''how to think about deplatforming'''. On one end of the spectrum — what he calls “the stack” — are consumer-facing platforms like Instagram and Twitter that anyone can post to. On the other are infrastructure providers like Cloudflare whose role is to provide basic access to the internet. Thompson argues that consumer platforms should moderate aggressively so as to attract the broadest possible audience — while infrastructure companies should try to limit their moderation to what is legal, so as to promote the maximum about of speech.\n\nThompson writes of Cloudflare’s decision to ban 8chan: “User-facing platforms are the ones that should make these calls, not infrastructure providers. But if they won’t, someone needs to. So Cloudflare did.” \n\nI think that’s the right framing — and the right decision on Cloudflare’s part.\n\nThe problem is that we have so few consumer-facing platforms that the “stack” Thompson describes looks increasingly flat. ''When your options for broadcasting to a large audience are limited to a small handful of companies, they start to look a lot like infrastructure.'' Which is precisely why politicians are making so much hay about “bias” on the platforms — they simply don’t have many other good options.\nBreaking up the tech platforms would cause any number of difficult problems for executives. But it could also give them more freedom to do the moderation their users want to see.\n\nHOW TO THINK ABOUT DEPLATFORMING: \nhttps://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-moderation/\nhttps://archive.fo/mwUkB",

			"body": "==El Paso Shooter Kills 8Chan?==\nAugust 9, 2019\nhttp://cerebraloverload.com/el-paso-shooter-kills-8chan/\nhttps://archive.fo/SiMHT\n\nIn addition to the deaths, another tragedy has occurred. This tragedy has all but murdered one of the last bastions of true free speech on the internet. The shooter allegedly wrote a manifesto and someone published it to the anonymous online forum 8Chan. There’s been zero confirmation that the shooter, himself, wrote it and 8Chan’s owner has confirmed that there’s no way the shooter uploaded it. But that didn’t stop their third-party provider, Cloudflare, from pulling 8Chan’s DDoS protection and DNS services, killing the site.\n\nIt’s been almost a week now and there is still no hard confirmation the shooter wrote the manifesto. It’s only “been reported” that he wrote it. So what’s the hold up? Has anyone asked him? If he used some kind of VPN or other means of cloaking his IP, why? Why would he hide if he legitimately thought he was going to die? All of these questions have no answers. So why would Cloudflare kill 8Chan when it still hasn’t been confirmed who wrote or uploaded the manifesto? What is for sure is that Cloudflare has an upcoming IPO and it probably doesn’t look good for them to be providing services to a site like 8Chan. Love it or hate it, 8Chan is the wild west for free speech on the internet… and politically correct corporate overlords have no time for freedoms.\n\n/QResearch/\n8Chan was also home to the extremely popular /qresearch/ board. Now, whatever your thoughts on QAnon, one thing is for sure, it’s definitely one of the most interesting internet happenings of all time. Which is probably why it made Time Magazine’s list of 25 Most Influential People on the Internet. I personally think Q is 100% legitimate. It still hasn’t been debunked (after 3 years) and there have been plenty of “proofs” that create “coincidences” that confirm its legitimacy. What I’m not sure of though is the motive behind it and whether it’s a good or bad happening. I will always be skeptical of government agencies (including anonymous or covert teams) talking about “change” and carrying out operations under the cover of darkness.\nSo is it possible that the El Paso shooter was a false flag operation? Could it have been done without the shooter’s knowledge? By that, I mean could some of these same shady alphabet agencies encouraged him to do it? 8Chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, even says in the video above that the manifesto was not uploaded to 8Chan by the shooter. So who uploaded it and why? Did they do it to intentionally to give legacy media a reason to tie the shooter to 8Chan, giving their third-party providers reason to shut them down? Also, why are there multiple witnesses that are on camera reporting multiple shooters all wearing black?\n\nNow, thanks in large part to legacy media, when I say “false flag,” many people may think that I mean that it was a hoax and that people didn’t die. That is not the case. False flag simply means that the reason and people behind the shooting are not what is being pushed in the mainstream media narrative. It does not mean it’s a hoax or that people didn’t die.\n\nNow think about it, what would really be necessary for a covert intelligence agency, with seemingly limitless funding and capabilities, to pull of something like this? I’d venture to say not very difficult at all. Why would the shooter wear ear protection if he was planning on being killed?\n\nThe Result\nThis shooting inadvertently (?) accomplished four main goals for the establishment:\n\n    Cloudflare got the political ammunition they needed to completely de-platform 8Chan, and subsequently QAnon, in preparation for their IPO (sellout),.\n    Democrats, globalists, and anti-gun advocates were given yet another reason to attack the 2nd Amendment and gun owners, demonizing them and giving them little hammers to use in the continuous chipping away of your right to protect yourself.\n    It gave Democrats and far-left “intersectional social justice warriors” another reason to further demonize straight white men in the eyes of society.\n    They were also able to change the news cycle back to bashing Trump, saying he caused the shooter to kill those innocent people with his “violent rhetoric.”\n\nAlso, what sense does it make for him to kill innocent people to push his “message” when it just gives his “enemies” even more of a reason to continue saying what they’re saying? Just from an objective standpoint, it’s completely counter-productive to his stated goals. It actually furthers their goals. People tend to stop listening to what you have to say when you shoot and kill innocent people. One cannot condemn the government in one breath for “imperialistic wars that have caused the loss of tens of thousands of American lives and untold numbers of civilian lives” and then think they’re justified killing innocent people on the other.\nAnyway, when are we going to figure out what happened with the Las Vegas shootin",

We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!”\n\nIt’s a shame about the deaths, in other words, but they never would have happened if immigrants didn’t keep trying to come here, and if Democrats would just let me stop them. “So, this atrocity,” as Nicole Hannah-Jones aptly summed up his view, “was caused by immigration.”\n\nHaving essentially blamed the victims for their own murders, the president was happily and enthusiastically acceding to what authorities think are the alleged killer’s specific demands.\n\n>So for the cost of a simple act of terror, you can have a President respond within one business day with an official policy motivated by your actions to keep out non-whites?\n\n>Great freaking deterrent to white nationalist terrorism. https://t.co/0y3fVdeVHM\n>    — Tiffany Bond (I) 🦞🇺🇸 (@TiffanyBond) August 5, 2019\n\n“This attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” says an anti-immigrant online manifesto that authorities think the accused gunman posted. It echoes the “invasion” rhetoric commonly employed by the president at his rallies and on Twitter. In fact, much of the language overlaps with that of the president and his supporters, including repeated entreaties to “send them back.”\n\nThe idea here is that some sort of bipartisan immigration reform would stop the epidemic of white-supremacist violence in the United States. But of course that makes sense only if you believe that racist killers have a legitimate complaint — that we shouldn’t have Latino immigrants, and that, therefore, they do bear some of the blame. (Never mind that people of Hispanic descent existed in El Paso long before that region was part of the United States.) This was the idea, too, behind Trump’s common warning, reiterated last month, that if migrants didn’t like the detention centers along the border, they could simply not come.\n\nmore divelling nonsense at link",

Amazon shut down the website, according to BuzzFeed News.\n\nWhat Epik says: After Voxility cut ties with Epik, Alex Stamos, Facebook’s former chief security officer, asserted that Epik is also using AWS, OVH, and Linode.\n\n<    https://t.co/7yXcwWHiDg is down at this moment, but https://t.co/0qNQFoe4pz is back. They have moved their nameservers into three IaaS providers: @awscloud, @OVH and @Linode.\n<    I wonder if Epik's use of those providers is compatible with their terms of service. pic.twitter.com/J6oM0KgIYA\n<   — Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) August 6, 2019\n\nGeekwire asked Epik CEO Rob Monster about the company’s use of AWS. He said Stamos’ tweet was not accurate.\n“We have used them for years and have not changed how we use them in years,” Monster said via email Wednesday, referring to AWS. “They host one of our redundant DNS nodes and we have them as one of our remote backup sites.”\n\nIn a phone interview with GeekWire on Tuesday evening, Monster said 8chan paid Epik on Monday for domain registrations. A domain name search on ICANN shows that Epik is the registrar for 8ch.net. Monster said Epik would help 8chan sell the domain names, if needed.\n\n'''Big picture''': From social media sites to cloud providers, ''' ''internet gatekeepers are grappling with how to moderate hate speech while avoiding the appearance of censorship.'' ''' When Cloudflare announced it was cutting off 8chan, the company’s CEO Matthew Prince said, “We continue to feel incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of content arbiter and do not plan to exercise it often.”\n\nIt has put sites like Twitter and Facebook in a difficult position, too. ''They’re frequently under pressure to remove posts containing right-wing extremism while simultaneously fielding accusations of anti-conservative bias.'' President Donald Trump is particularly skeptical of how social media sites treat conservatives. The White House plans to host top tech companies to discuss the rise of violent extremism online this Friday, The Washington Post reports.",

But the post piqued his interest, and he wanted to know more. So he did what your average teenager would do: He followed several accounts related to it on Instagram, searched for information on YouTube, and read up on it on forums.\nA year and a half later, Alex, who asked to use a pseudonym, runs his own Gen Z–focused QAnon Instagram account, through which he educates his generation about the secret plot by the “deep state” to take down Donald Trump. “I was just noticing a lack in younger people being interested in QAnon, so I figured I would put it out there that there was at least one young person in the movement,” he told me via Instagram direct message. He hopes to “expose the truth about everything corrupt governments and organizations have lied about.” Among those truths: that certain cosmetics and foods contain aborted fetal cells, that the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash was a hoax, and that the Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings were staged.\nInstagram is teeming with these conspiracy theories, viral misinformation, and extremist memes, all daisy-chained together via a network of accounts with incredible algorithmic reach and millions of collective followers—many of whom, like Alex, are very young. These accounts intersperse TikTok videos and nostalgia memes with anti-vaccination rhetoric, conspiracy theories about George Soros and the Clinton family, and jokes about killing women, Jews, Muslims, and liberals.\n\nRecent posts by @the.new.federation, which has more than 38,000 followers, include a post likening Representative Maxine Waters to an ape, one that labels an image depicting prison rape as “how socialism works,” and several suggesting that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died months ago and is “better off dead.” Yesterday, it asked, “If Muslims can behead Christians, why can’t we do the same to them?” That post has 2,088 likes.\nA post from @unclesamsmisguidedchildren, which has more than 559,000 followers, implies that John Podesta is partially responsible for the New Zealand shooting. That post has more than 8,300 likes. A post made four days ago includes a video promoting the conspiracy that more than 22 Islamic terror camps operate in the United States and are likely responsible for the shooting in Parkland, Florida. It has been viewed more than 200,500 times.\n\n    Thank G-D! I have a 19 yr old and we keep seeing more GenZ’ers being awake and following #QAnon movement‼️\n\n    🙏🇱🇷✌️🇱🇷🙏 https://t.co/0eoQYJYga6\n    — Qatzman ♋️ (@katzman_69) December 31, 2018\n\nIn an email, an Instagram spokesperson told me that the company and its parent, Facebook, “continue to study trends in organized hate and hate speech and work with partners to better understand hate organizations as they evolve.” The spokesperson added, “We ban these organizations and individuals from Instagram and also remove all praise and support when we become aware of it. We will continue to review content, accounts, and people that violate our policies and take action against hate speech and hate organizations to help keep our community safe.”\nSince 2016, social-media companies have come under fire for allowing white supremacy and other extremist ideologies to spread. YouTube’s algorithms have been shown to push people further toward the fringes; a New York Times headline called the site “the Great Radicalizer.” Facebook is notorious for allowing anti-vaxxers and other conspiracy theorists to organize and spread their messages to millions—already, the top two most-shared news stories on Facebook in 2019 are both false. Twitter, too, has been criticized for being slow to police the misinformation that spreads on its platform.\nBut Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are not where young people go to socialize. Instagram is.",

Investigators questioned former Orange County police officer Nicholas Tartaglione, suspected of killing four men in a cocaine distribution conspiracy, in connection with the incident. The former cop claimed to have not seen anything nor touched Epstein. \n\nNeedless to say, today's news is highly suspicious. \n\n<    Even the time of day in this story is shocking.

Epstein told authorities he was beaten up and called a child predator, they said.\n...........\nSo question is: Did he off himself or was he eliminated?\nHe had no cellmate at the time of his first \"injury\" - El Chapo was 3 doors down and a photo of him in his cell was published, there is only one bed, so Epstein had no cellmate. The crooked cop was mentioned in stories at the time.\n\nAlso, no other stories on Epstein are mentioning how he died. CNN says (above) that he was rushed to hospital \"in cardiac arrest\"\n>heart attacks can be deadly\n?\n",

It’s after-hours, actually but it was really cool … sex … like.”==\n\n\nShe adds, “''But you don’t have to have sex, just naked people walking round. It’s really cool.'' I ran from it last time. I wasn’t expecting it, but this time I watched it. I didn’t know it happens, but it’s really f—ing different. Yeah, it happens — ''we’re hitting one tonight in Queens.''”\n\nWhen asked about whom she was traveling to the party with, she added, “He’s just my friend, he’s not even my boyfriend … he’s married. I know, I feel evil, but I can’t help it … We didn’t even hook up, but it’s kind of fun, but anyway … but I don’t want anyone to know, you know?”\n\nIt is not clear which sex party Mueller — who has physical custody of her twin 10-year-old sons with Sheen — attended in the Hamptons, and whether she actually went to another in Queens. Last summer, Snctm, an elite erotic club based in Los Angeles that reportedly counts Gwyneth Paltrow and Bill Maher among its fans, threw a black-tie “Masquerade” event at an opulent private Hamptons residence on Aug. 5. The erotic “Eyes Wide Shut”-style event, we’re told, was limited to only 99 guests.\n",

The FBI declined to comment about its investigation.\n\n“I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody,” Barr said. “Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered.”\n\nNeither the Justice Department not the inspector general's office immediately responded to the Washington Examiner's request for further details.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons released a statement on Saturday stating that the jet-setting financier and sex offender was found “unresponsive in his cell” located in the Special Housing Unit at around 6:30 a.m. this morning following “an apparent suicide.” Officials said lifesaving efforts were immediately undertaken and that emergency medical services were quickly called. Epstein was brought to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nEpstein reportedly hanged himself, and a gurney carrying Epstein's body was wheeled out of the Manhattan Correctional Center around 7:30 a.m. this morning, according to reports.\n\nAccording to a representative for NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner who spoke with the Washington Examiner, \"there is no official cause of death yet\" as \"the medical examiner has to do their job.\"\n\n\"We are investigating the cause of death and we have an open case,\" the representative said.\n\nThe 14-page indictment against Epstein alleged that he sexually exploited dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005 and perhaps beyond. Some of the victims were ostensibly as young as 14 at the time the alleged crimes occurred. Epstein allegedly “created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit\"and “maintained a steady supply of new victims.\"\n\nEpstein was reportedly found nearly unconscious on his cell floor with marks on his neck back in July, but it had never been officially confirmed by authorities whether he had attempted to take his own life, whether he’d been assaulted by another inmate, or whether it was a ploy to change prisons.\n\nEpstein was subsequently placed on suicide watch, but there are numerous reports that when he was found dead Saturday he “was in his cell but was not on suicide watch at the time of his death.”\n\nThe Manhattan Correctional Center did not immediately respond to questions from the Washington Examiner about the circumstances of Epstein's suicide and how it was allowed to happen.\n\nHorowitz has handled high-profile investigations before. Last summer, the watchdog released a 568-page report on Midyear Exam, the DOJ and FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's improper private email server. And the inspector general is expected to release the results of his investigation into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the Trump-Russia probe sometime around Labor Day.\n\nEpstein's apparent suicide followed the unsealing on Friday of 2,000 pages of court records by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit connected to the defamation lawsuit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s on-again-off-again girlfriend and longtime associate whom Giuffre has accused of helping Epstein abuse her and other women when Giuffre was underage. The records included allegations by Giuffre that Maxwell instructed her to have sex with the U.K.'s Prince Andrew, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, and former Sen. George Mitchell as well as money manager Glenn Dubin and MIT professor Marvin Minksy, among other high-profile figures.\n\nBefore Friday, Epstein’s flight records spanning from 1999 through 2005 had been made public, but new flight manifests ranging from November 1995 through August 2013 were released Friday. The records show Epstein crisscrossed the globe accompanied by tycoons, celebrities, employees, friends, and politicos.\n\ncon'td",

They might be on Twitter. They might be on Facebook. They might be ordering coffee at a Starbucks. They might be plotting some sort of far-right apocalypse. They might just be talking about movies on reddit. There’s no way of knowing.\nWe should all be terribly worried.\nAt least, according to The Guardian, who headline today:\n\n    “8chan: ex-users of far-right site flock to new homes across internet\n\nFirst off, of course, 8chan was not a “far-right site”, it was a site with some “far-right” people on it.\nThere are hundreds of boards on 8chan, with thousands upon thousands of different posters. Boards could be created by anyone to discuss anything.\nThe vast majority were dedicated to perfectly ordinary topics. Video games, fashion, cars, movies. There were many much more specific, fetishy, niche and weird…but not “far-right”. The site didn’t have an ideology except “free speech”.\nThe general shifting of “free speech” from something we all take for granted to being described as a “far-right agenda” is one of the most worrying trends in modern politics.\nThe article is actually funny, not least for the total lack of web literacy on display:\n\n    “Former members of 8chan have scattered across the internet after the far-right site was shut down over the weekend\n\nThis is simply ridiculous to anyone who knows anything about the nature of 8chan et al. There are no “members”. That, indeed, is the whole entire point of the place. It is anonymous and temporary. No usernames, no registration, no “membership”.\nThe press has a long history of simply not being able to grasp the way the internet works (as in the famous “Who is this 4chan?” CNN interview or Fox’s “internet hate machine” piece), but this is such basic ignorance of the topic at hand that I almost can’t believe it’s genuine.\nIndeed, it might not be. It might be that portraying “8chan” as some sort of organized community plays into the media’s need to generate fear. This generates, “the problem”, which sets us up for…\nThe Reaction\nHaving established that 8chan’s “far-right” “members” are out there in the ether, being terrifying, the article needs to get some feedback on what that means.\nTo do this they go to two “consultants”:\n\n    •Joan Donovan, who runs the Technology and Social Change (TaSC) Research Project\n    •Ben Decker the CEO of “Memetic Consultancy” (sic. It’s actually “Memetica”).\n\nThey are portrayed as two essentially different voices, as if we’re getting a spectrum of opinion. But the most cursory check on Donovan and Decker shows they are both research fellows at the Shorenstein Institute of the Kennedy School of Government. They aren’t separate. At all.\n(NOTE: In fact, Memetica, Shorenstein, and other NGOs currently talking up the need for internet censorship are a ripe subject for a full-on exposé, and will be in the near future)\nNot at all surprisingly, being research fellows for the same institute at the same university, Decker and Donovan absolutely agree on pretty much everything.\nPrimarily, that shutting down 8chan was a really good idea, but won’t – on its own – solve the “far-right” problem.\nApparently, all the people that posted on 8chan will NOT flee the internet forever, but will now just go and post somewhere else. Why anyone would need two Harvard-trained academics to tell them this, I don’t know.\nWhere will they go?\nWell, other scary places of course. Like the “far-right forum” Gab, or back to 4chan or reddit. Some of them will be “absorbed” by the social media giants (meaning they will post on Twitter and Facebook), and some will post in discussions on encrypted message services like Telegram and Discord.\nFor some reason, Gab is a real bugbear for centrists, being regularly attacked simply for existing. Its one claim to infamy is that the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter apparently had a Gab account…this, apparently, makes it a far-right social network.\nNiche and independent networks are always attacked by-association in this way. The Dayton shooter and “MAGABomber” both had twitter accounts, and the Christ Church attack was live-streamed on Facebook…but they are not shut down.\nThe Solution\nHaving established that shutting down 8chan was brilliant, but more is needed, our two NGO representatives set out what else needs to be done:\n\n    “One way to prevent 8chan users from migrating to alternative social media spaces like YouTube and Facebook would be to build a moat around the platforms to prevent inbound links from these sites,”\n\nThis is total, complete nonsense. \nMOAR @ LINK",

As has been Epstein’s pattern,'''” she wrote.\n>shock the conscience\n>failed attempt\n>Epstein's pattern\n<She knows what will come out\n“Jail suicide[s] are rare. We had a few in my community.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).\n\n“We need answers. Lots of them,” wrote Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n“I agree @AOC,” Gaetz said. “Chairman @RepJerryNadler should prioritize a Judiciary investigation into how Jeffrey Epstein died in federal custody (in Nadler’s own neighborhood!) over the Kavanaugh confirmation (which already happened), and the Russia hoax (which never happened).”\n\nkek - Gaetz is good",

Prosecutors claimed that Epstein “enticed and recruited” minor girls to” engage in sex acts with him” and that he would then “give the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.” Some of the victims were as young as 14 at the time the alleged crimes occurred.\n>Little St. James is in US jurisdiction, but his house in Paris is not.\n\nAdditionally, prosecutors alleged that an unnamed “''New York-based employee''” and ''two unnamed assistants in Palm Beach'' would help with scheduling some of these encounters, and that Epstein would also contact some of the victims directly. Investigators allege '''Epstein conspired with others to traffic minors for sex'''. \n>NY employee was from his \"modeling\" company M2\n>unnamed assistants in PB do not reference Ghislane Maxwell, so there are other women involved\n>the sex trafficking is necessarily international due to one girl he bought in the Ukraine; if he has activities in Paris or elsewhere, it will really get big",

Now? She is frantic. Apparently she was drawing more attention than even she could have anticipated. Because with everything going on, she never imagined that even Russian oligarchs would find her “too hot to handle”. After all, their relationships went back decades. Billions of dollars changing hands, and secrets that could change history of more than one nation.\n“She” is a woman we will refer to as “MARI”. The best way to describe Mari is as a middle-aged foreign-born woman raised in a life of privilege, wealth, global luxury — and a legacy of criminal immorality that warps the mind just to fathom it all. Her own father had been a scandalous man in every way that would be the center of a million stories of his own. The things she witnessed and even suffered growing up would be enough to drive anyone insane.\nUnfortunately, she decided to carry that torch herself. She has perpetuated that hell on her own.\nShe became the partner, co-conspirator, and confidant of a man who has grown to be one of the most disgusting, perverted, rapist animals of our current era. (We’ll just call him MONSTER). His crimes and reach have been well documented for many years. And through it all, Mari has been right there. In fact Mari has been of equal responsibility in that monster’s crimes. She has been his procurer, his partner, and when the mood hit her — even a willing participant. She is no victim.\nBut most of all, Mari has been in charge of the cover ups, lawsuits, and protection of both Monster and herself. Most of all, Mari has found herself trying to use the information (the proof) she has, as a bargaining chip to save herself, even against the most powerful people in the world.\nWhen many questioned how the Monster was able to facilitate relations with so many powerful people, they rarely saw Mari in the shadows. It was usually her “hands” at work, using contacts and relations of her family. Her dad’s old business friends (and enemies) and many of his government friends — they all knew her charming social style. They also knew of her bent to the wild side, and her “anything goes” attitude; along with the discretion it required.\nMany people had forgotten (or maybe didn’t know) of Mari’s family and their relations with foreign leaders. Especially third-world dictators. Mari was actually the missing link in a bizarre nexus of people who otherwise may never cross paths. From Hollywood celebrities, to global corrupt military leaders, to technology businessmen — Mari knew so many of them. Her father had paved the way, so it was easy for her to follow.\n\nThis is why, when the sexually criminal actions of Mari and Monster, began to be a “thing” among the rich and powerful — they needed more privacy. So it was Mari who found a very secluded island for their activities. This place and its many crimes have been documented many times (including by our pals at CDAN and in the mainstream press). But what is not as well known is this other foreign locale; nearly a country almost to themselves.\n\nIt was within a country ruled by a nearly-insane dictator, under the guise of Socialism. That dictator has now died, but his protégé has carried on. This nation was also ground zero for a constant flow of vulnerable victims from dirt-poor families that could be easily “erased” if the need be. Best of all for their plans — it was within close jet distance from their private island; and in the same hemisphere as the USA. No need to make refuel stops, so less paper trails. It provided no shortage of cover stories, including “humanitarian work” and “environmental work”. All within an easily-bribed corrupt government happy to provide protection. Funny thing, that for a socialist country? They sure enjoyed the millions they got paid, under the table, to protect the criminals.\n\nThe criminals were Monster, Mari, and their guests.\n\n1/?",

It is very easy to connect the dots between this country; a legendary political family from America; and a super-tough lawyer (or two) who are the weak links in the cover up for Mari and the Monster’s actions. It was part of the lawyers’ spin plans back when the Monster was first accused. Little did they know that many years later, those same news quotes and even Youtube videos, would rear their heads to point the way to lead people to connect the dots. So obvious is it, that Mari has contacted the lawyers and told them to warn the political family of their exposure. But those same lawyers aren’t happy to take her calls now either.\n\nNor is the Hollywood A-Lister with a history of friendship with banana-Republic rulers. That A-Lister was a guest of Mari, as a tag-along with a member of that political family. The A-Lister, for all of his own nasty history, enjoyed the party favors at the foreign hideaway; but he drew the line at partaking in sexual activities. (Which says a lot with that guy’s history).\n\nIn fact, the A-Lister (who is either an actor or director, or maybe even both), was disgusted by what he was offered by his hosts; and the few things he saw himself. So he partook of partying/drugs, but not the underage sex crimes. According to the A-Lister, he is very scared about the people he did see there and what it could mean if it all came out. Not just as a witness for legal reasons, but scared for his life. Not his career — as this is a guy who revels in controversy. He is literally afraid for his own life. Maybe he should’ve been more scared…not for himself but for those poor victims…back when he was partying on site with them all.\n\nSo now we come in back where we began.\n\nThe Monster is dead, and regardless of how, who, and whatever — he is actually dead. Cheating justice for all the victims. But there are many, many, many loose ends left out “there”. After this untimely, yet very predictable, demise of her Monster crony; Mari is now frantically trying to secure a meeting with a Russian oligarch she knows well. A man who has spent millions and many years trying to whitewash his reputation and hide his own past. Trying to keep himself far away from scandal and appear as just another billionaire global businessman. The last thing this guy probably wants is to be affiliated with Mari, or mentioned in the same story. But he has no choice really.\n\nMari has proof of many of his old dealings, going back all the way to her own father’s era. Her father (a monster himself), had helped the oligarch in the late 80's-early 90’s. Her father who was murdered, despite findings of “suicide”. Her same father whose murder was alleged to be ordered by Russian oligarchs for his waste of tens of millions of their money he was supposed to be laundering. In fact, this Russian oligarch and Mari have many similar friends — in politics; Hollywood; and in sitting government positions today.\n\nThe Russian also knows that Mari is clever enough to be sure that if she meets an untimely demise? Much of that proof will certainly be made public. That would be a disaster for the Russian, and many of the most powerful people in politics (both sides of the aisle); global business, and entertainment/media. None of them want that.\nSome have speculated that Mari’s father never actually died, by suicide nor by murder — and that some of his former associates in foreign government security services had helped arrange his disappearance. It is with that in mind that Mari has contacted this Russian lately. According to the Russian oligarch, there is no way she can make it out of her current situation in one piece. The best she can hope for is to arrange a “suicide” or “murder” of her own that will allow her to slip off the map undetected. She still has tens of millions of Monster’s money along with her own to help her vanish.\n\nBecause if she can’t do it? Many others will make sure she does die, for real.\n\nThose who can be brought down by what Mari can reveal — they want time to stop her fail-safe backup leaks, BEFORE they leak (in case of her demise). Meanwhile, Mari must certainly want to rapidly wrap up her future plans before she’s locked up and cannot. According to the Russian oligarch, he’s avoided this as long as possible. He has to decide what to do. So he has reached out to London and Washington to help him decide. But even he is afraid of the answer.\n\n(PART TWO to follow).",

			"body": "==Barr to Epstein co-conspirators: You 'should not rest easy'==\nby Jerry Dunleavy | August 12, 2019 12:34 PM \nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-to-epstein-co-conspirators-you-should-not-rest-easy\nhttps://archive.fo/zFv3Z\n\nAttorney General William Barr said Monday he learned of “serious irregularities” at the Manhattan prison where accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein died Saturday.\n\nBarr vowed that the investigation will continue and warned that Epstein’s co-conspirators “should not rest easy.”\n\nDr. Barbara Sampson, New York City’s chief medical examiner, said Sunday evening an autopsy had been completed and that the medical examiner’s final determination is pending further information.\n\nBarr, speaking at an event for the Fraternal Order of Police in New Orleans this morning, said that he was “appalled” to learn of Epstein’s apparent suicide and revealed the Justice Department was “learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation.” The Bureau of Prisons said Saturday that Epstein was found dead in his cell that morning.\n\nHe promised that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and the FBI, who are both investigating the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death, will \"get to the bottom of what happened.\" \n<snip>\nBarr said that the Justice Department would continue its investigation of Epstein’s alleged child trafficking conspiracy despite his death.\n\n“Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice, and they will get it,” he said.\n\nProsecutors believe that Epstein had help committing his crimes, and there are believed to be many other alleged Epstein victims. The 14-page indictment unsealed in July references co-conspirators.\n\nEpstein, the already convicted sex offender and jet-setting financier, was alleged to have “sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls” at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005 and perhaps beyond. Prosecutors claimed Epstein “enticed and recruited” minor girls to “engage in sex acts with him” and built a “vast network of underage victims.”\n\nProsecutors alleged that an unnamed “New York-based employee” and two unnamed assistants in Palm Beach would help with scheduling some of these encounters, and that Epstein would also contact some of the victims directly. Investigators allege Epstein conspired with others to traffic minors for sex.\n\nProsecutors said Saturday that their investigation \"remains ongoing.\" \n\nEpstein's apparent suicide followed the unsealing on Friday of 2,000 pages of court records connected to the defamation lawsuit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, whom Giuffre has accused of helping Epstein abuse her and others when Giuffre was underage. The records included allegations by Giuffre that Maxwell instructed her to have sex with the U.K.'s Prince Andrew, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, and former Sen. George Mitchell, among other high-profile figures.\n\nEpstein’s arrest in July marked the second time he had been investigated for sex crimes. Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney for Southern Florida who resigned as Trump’s labor secretary, reached a controversial agreement in 2008 with Epstein’s attorneys in which Epstein was allowed to plead guilty to two state-level prostitution solicitation charges.\n\nEpstein served just 13 months in a Palm Beach County jail with work release, paid some restitution, and registered as a sex offender. The secret agreement was reportedly struck before investigators finished interviewing all the alleged victims. And that sweetheart deal included criminal immunity for a number of potential co-conspirators of Epstein.\n\nVIDEO OF BARR SPEAKING: https://youtu.be/01mK6QNegPg",

We are the only guests out here at the moment. We were enjoying lunch when we saw over a dozen people getting off their speedboats and landing on the island'\n\nA former air traffic controller at the island's airport told Vanity Fair: 'On multiple occasions I saw Epstein exit his helicopter, stand on the tarmac in full view of my tower, and board his private jet with children—female children. One incident in particular really stands out in my mind, because the girls were just so young. They couldn’t have been over 16.'\n\n==kek==\nHidden messages: The temple has been of great interest to members of the QAnon community, who had been talking about the island long before Epstein's arrest\n\nEpstein had erected 'No Trespassing' signs throughout around almost all of Great St. James due to the area's popularity with tourists.\n\nLocal laws make all land below the tide or bush lines public property, so Epstein couldn't legally kick people off those lands, but he was being vigilant about making sure no one wanders onto his property.\n\nHe had made Little St. James his primary residence, but in June the helicopter that shuttles the millionaire and his guests to and from the airport was listed for sale online, with an asking price of $1.8 million\n\nEpstein also sold one of his private jets in June. His other was seized when he was arrested in July after landing back on US soil following three-week trip to Paris.\n\nIn total, Epstein's properties are valued at close to $150 million. \n\nThere is the Paris bolthole where he spent the weeks before returning to the US and getting arrested on the tarmac as his plane touched down at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. \n\nThe $9 million pied-a-terre is located on one of the nicest blocks in the City of Lights, and Epstein traveled there frequently, often spending a few months at the apartment each summer. \n1/2",

A tranche of 2,000 pages was disclosed by the US courts released last week, and in them Miss Roberts said she 'met Naomi Campbell at a birthday party of hers on a yacht in the South of France'.\n\n'She is a friend of Ghislaine's, but she was a real b**** to me,' Miss Roberts said. Later, the same document stated: 'I met famous friends of [Epstein's], such as Al Gore, Heidi Klum, and Naomi Campbell.'\n\nHer lawyer Sigrid McCawley asked: 'When in 2001 did you go on a six-week trip with him?' Miss Roberts replied: 'I don't remember exactly when it was but, it's the one where we went to Tangier, Morocco, England... France.'\n\nMiss Roberts wrote about another encounter with Miss Campbell – a year later – in a manuscript of her memoir, which was also included in the court documents. They all attended the grand opening of the Nikki Beach Club in St Tropez where Miss Campbell was hosting her birthday in 2002.\n>moar at link",

Of those, 15 are now in custody, and law enforcement has made contact with the remaining four defendants. In February 2019, DEA made the first arrests related to Operation Mad Hatter, and today’s arrests stem from activity uncovered during the ongoing investigation. Ten defendants had been arrested throughout the investigation, and the remaining five were arrested this morning, completing this phase of the operation.\n\nDuring the course of Operation Mad Hatter, investigators have seized 17 kilograms of methamphetamine, 4 kilograms of cocaine, 249 grams of crack cocaine, over 1 kilogram of heroin, over 200 diverted prescription pills, over $107,000 in assets, and numerous firearms.\n< moar at link\n\n\n'''Relevant Q post''':\n10/3/18\t\n>>3317104\t\nhttps://8ch.net/qresearch/res/3316613.html#3317104\n\nhttps://archive.fo/SBDmD#selection-42029.0-42039.1\t\n\nQ !!mG7VJxZNCI  \n10/03/18 (Wed) 16:42:03 d24699\n\n>https://foia.state.gov/Search/Results.aspx?collection=Litigation_F-2016-07895_47\n>[Pg 20 - Assange Arrest]\n>By: Marty Torrey [Mad Hatter]\n\nARCHIVE:\nFOIA MAIN PAGE: https://archive.fo/kST5B\nPG 20 DOCUMENT: https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/Litigation_F-2016-07895_47/F-2016-07895/DOC_0C06153474/C06153474.pdf\n\n\nAlice = Hillary\nMarty Torrey = Mad Hatter\n>It was the Mad Hatter's tea party, Alice was not in control",

			"body": "==Three Big Questions About Jeffrey Epstein’s Wealth==\nJohn Carney12 Aug 2019\nhttps://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/08/12/three-big-questions-about-jeffrey-epsteins-wealth/\nhttps://archive.fo/KI3Iw\n\nThe mysteries surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s wealth pose a new challenge for investigators following his death: how do you freeze assets and preserve wealth for his alleged victims when so little is known about the sources or locations of his wealth?\n\nEpstein, who was ''charged with sexually abusing __hundreds__ of adolescent girls'' in New York and Florida, was found dead in his jail cell on Saturday. While Epstein’s death was initially reported as an apparent suicide, the medical examiner in New York has said further investigation is needed before he will declare suicide as the cause of death.\n\nAttorney General William Bar said on Monday that Mr. Epstein’s death would not halt the ''investigation into people who allegedly helped him recruit and traffic young girls.'' Several women have alleged that ''female associates of Epstein actively recruited and managed'' girls as young as 14-years-old to perform sexual services for Epstein and his friends.\n\n“Any co-conspirators should not rest easy,” Barr said. “The victims deserve justice and ''they will get it''.”\n\nAttorneys for some of those victims have announced plans to file civil suits against his estate. And it is likely that federal prosecutors will file cases for civil forfeiture against the estate’s assets. But tracking down Epstein’s wealth and preserving it may be difficult because so much about Epstein’s fortune remains unknown.\n\nHere are some of the questions that still need to be answered.\n\n''' ''How much wealth did Epstein have?'' ''' Epstein owns a huge mansion in Manhattan, a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, an enormous ranch in New Mexico, an apartment in Paris, a home in Palm Beach, Florida, and two private planes.  The New York Times estimated that his real estate holding alone are worth around $200 million. Upkeep of the properties and the planes would amount to several million each year.\n\nIn his plea for bail, Epstein listed his wealth as around $500 million–far less than the billions he was said to have possessed prior to his arrest. That could be because his wealth was exaggerated or declined in the aftermath of his 2007 arrest and the financial crisis. ''Or it could be that he has hidden his wealth.''\n\n''' ''Where is Epstein’s financial wealth?'' ''' Jeffrey Epstein had investments and accounts with Bear Stearns, his former employer, for years after he left that firm. These included tens of millions of dollars invested in hedge funds owned by Bear. Documents uncovered by McClatchy and the Miami Herald show from at least 2000 to 2007 Epstein was chairman of a company called Liquid Funding Ltd, a Bear Stearns subsidiary that lent out billions to hedge funds and others while selling its own debt to investors.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase purchased Bear Stearns as the storied investment bank collapsed in March 2008. The New York Times has reported that Epstein was a client of J.P. Morgan Chase until 2013. It’s likely that the bank essentially inherited Epstein as a client when it acquired Bear. A spokesman for the bank could not say whether Epstein was employed in any way by the legacy Bear outfits after the takeover.\n\nAt that point, it seems Epstein moved assets and currency trading business to Deutsche Bank, where Mr. Epstein was a client from 2013 until June 2019. Deutsche Bank is currently cooperating with investigators.

We are the news now.\n\n==GOP lawmaker shares 'tip' about 'illegal coup' against Trump==\nby Daniel Chaitin\nAugust 12, 2019 04:46 PM\nUpdated Aug 12, 2019, 04:53 PM\nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/gop-lawmaker-shares-tip-about-illegal-coup-against-trump\nhttps://archive.fo/sYqlj\n\n\nA Republican member of Congress tweeted about an \"illegal coup\" against President Trump on Monday, responding to an account that has spread conspiracy theory content.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar of Arizona said on Monday he has a \"tip\" about how FBI agents have \"colluded\" with British agents and Democratic operatives.\n\n\"I have a tip. I think high level FBI agents may have colluded with British agents and Democrat operatives to initiate an illegal coup against @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS. I mean at least this bears a cursory review. Perhaps. Maybe,\" the congressman tweeted from his verified account, tagging Trump's accounts.\n\nA number of Republicans have alleged Trump was the target of covert plan to boost his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton and later undermine his presidency, raising questions about the origins of the counterintelligence investigation that focused on the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. With the completion of former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia, which the president dubbed a \"witch hunt,\" Trump's GOP allies have championed Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham who are now reviewing the Justice Department's and FBI's conduct during the Russia investigation.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to his office for comment about the tweet. Afterwards, Gosar tweeted a follow-up message. \"Some of you are missing the sarcasm here. Attached is the Mueller report. It starts with a meeting by @GeorgePapa19 and a British spy in London. Yet that remains uninvestigated by the FBI. Hence the tip,\" he said, tagging former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and linking to CNN's posting of Mueller's redacted report.\n\n>Some of you are missing the sarcasm here. Attached is the Mueller report. It starts with a meeting by @GeorgePapa19 and a British spy in London. Yet that remains uninvestigated by the FBI. Hence the tip. https://t.co/EoPvMgZG5w https://t.co/1YGgONzlom\n    — Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) August 12, 2019 \n\nGosar has been a Republican congressman from Arizona since 2011. He won reelection last year after six of his siblings released an ad campaign endorsing his Democratic challenger David Brill.\n\nHis tweet Monday was a retweet of Majestic 12, an unverified account with 27,000 followers and a pinned tweet about QAnon and \"the Plan.\"\n\n>I have a tip. I think high level FBI agents may have colluded with British agents and Democrat operatives to initiate an illegal coup against @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS .

See something, say something,\" the tweet said, which appears to be a reference to QAnon, along with a link to the FBI's \"submit a tip\" page.\n\nQAnon is an online movement that originated on 4chan message boards with posts by an anonymous person going by “Q,” who claimed to be a government official with top-secret intelligence clearance and who made a variety of ''evidence-free claims'' about Trump covertly battling a series of deep state plots and global conspiracies.\n\nMuch of what the Majestic 12 account has tweeted about in the past few days relates to the apparent suicide of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which has spawned a wide array of conspiracy theories.\n\n\n",

			"body": "==Jeffrey Epstein before he died: 'The only thing worse than being called a pedophile is being called a hedge fund manager': FOX Business exclusive==\nBy Charlie Gasparino Published August 13, 2019\nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/features/jeffrey-epstein-exclusive-hedge-fund\nhttps://archive.fo/nog8S\n\nOne of the many tragedies in the Jeffrey Epstein saga is that we will never get to hear Epstein publicly explain himself. His alleged victims will never get their day in court and we will never know how he made his millions to further what the federal government says was a criminal sex trafficking ring, or possibly, how he could live with himself knowing the totality of his life had brought him to a dank jail cell awaiting a trial he was likely to lose.\n\nI can’t offer the true closure that any of his alleged victims need because as we all know, Epstein is dead, having hanged himself in his jail cell last Saturday. But in a small way, I can provide some insight into what was bouncing around inside his head as the judicial vice began to close on him earlier this year.\n\nThat’s because I was one of the few reporters to have spoken with Epstein in recent months, just before he returned to the U.S. on July 6 to be arrested on new federal charges of operating a multi-state sex trafficking ring involving underage girls.\n\nI have never met Epstein in person, though I knew of him well. He was a money manager to the ultra-wealthy – he had homes around the world, private jets and friends in very high places (policymakers, major academics, former president Bill Clinton and the current president, Donald Trump, among them), or so I was told by his associates on Wall Street.\n\nI had sources who were close to him while he was at Bear Stearns decades ago and later when he managed private money. His clients included billionaire retailer Leslie Wexner, who runs L Brands, the parent of Victoria’s Secret, and a few select others who were said to have allowed him to trade their wealth through the firm and several other big banks.\n\nThey described Epstein as super-rich with mansions in Manhattan, Palm Beach and one on an island he owns in the Caribbean. Rich people hired him because he was great at understanding the tax code for his clients. He was also fun to be around (Epstein was known to date models and society women).\n\nLike most of the world, I would find out that Epstein also had a dark side, having been accused of engaging in sex with underage girls at his Palm Beach mansion between roughly 2005 and 2007.\nAfter taking a plea deal for one count of procuring a minor for prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution, he spent some time in jail, though apparently not enough. Since his release from prison in 2009, he’s faced victim lawsuits and intense media scrutiny over what was seen as a light sentence crafted by his dream team of lawyers that included Kenneth Starr, Alan Dershowitz and Roy Black, as well as spineless prosecutors.\n\nDespite reading about his case over the years, I never felt a real need to cover Epstein’s sordid legal contretemps primarily because I didn't know what I could add to the story. That changed earlier in the year when several news reports, primarily in the Miami Herald, brought a new perspective to the Epstein imbroglio including a possible motive for his lenient sentencing – that it was the result of Epstein being a cooperator for the government investigating on post-financial crisis-related crimes, including the prosecution of two Bear Stearns executives who ran an ill-fated hedge fund that sparked the meltdown.\n\nI found it an odd rationale for letting someone escape serious jail time for child-sex trafficking mainly because if he was a cooperator, he was a weak one. I covered the financial crisis and its aftermath closely. The feds didn’t charge a single major Wall Street executive with a crime related to the crisis. There were few civil charges against big firms but that's about it. The hedge fund managers were acquitted at trial. Epstein's name never appeared on any witness list.\n\nI put in calls to the usual suspects: Epstein’s lawyers, the prosecutors and the lawyers for the hedge fund managers. They all confirmed my suspicion: Epstein was an investor in the Bear Stearns funds and lost a lot of money when they blew up (around $50 million). He knew a lot of people on Wall Street, but he didn’t help the feds on this case or any other involving the financial crisis.\n\nMy next call was to Epstein himself, a long shot to be sure, since he was known as someone who didn't like speaking to reporters. Over the years, he rarely engaged with the press and only when he felt assured he could control the narrative. Those days had long passed.\n\n1/2\n",

She said she would relay the message.\nA few minutes later, I received a call from a scrambled telephone number. When I answered, a man with a thick Brooklyn accent responded: “Charlie, it's Jeffrey Epstein returning your call.”\n\nIt would be the start of several brief but revealing conversations with Epstein, who immediately asked if we could speak off the record. I said I needed to use whatever he said to enhance my narrative and make the piece as fair as possible, and he agreed to speak without the quotes attributed directly to him.\n\nI am now reporting what he said in his own words for a couple of reasons: First, Epstein is dead, and journalists have been known to provide the identities of anonymous sources on important stories once the person has passed (think Woodward and Bernstein’s deal with the Watergate source they called “Deep Throat,” former FBI agent Mark Felt).\nMore importantly, this qualifies as an important story. Anything we can glean about Epstein, in his own words and not filtered through the nuances of background sourcing, may provide a better understanding of the man and the allegations against him.\n\nI should point out that Epstein, based on our conversations, ''didn’t seem like he believed he committed much of a crime''. He was at times dismissive, and at others, he displayed gallows humor at his predicament, which was growing more acute by the day. It was around this time, in March, that just about every major bank had stopped doing business with him amid the frenzy of press activity. Friends abandoned him or minimized their relationship.\n\nWhether Epstein knew it or not, the feds had opened another investigation that would lead to his arrest months later. My guess, based on the tenor of the conversation, was that ''Epstein was unaware of the totality of the trouble he faced, or he didn’t care, thinking he would beat the rap again by hiring more high-powered lawyers.''\n\nMaybe that’s why before he was arrested, he returned to the U.S. from France, a country with such weak extradition laws that director Roman Polansky, who plead guilty to sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old in the late 1970s, remains there to this day.\n\nI began by asking Epstein about the notion that he served as a government witness for its investigation Wall Street after the crisis. His denial was even more emphatic than his lawyers’. “It’s all b-------,” he snapped.\n\nI referenced an FBI memo dated September 2008 that stated, “Epstein has also provided information to the FBI as agreed upon.” But ''Epstein said that referenced his cooperation in providing the feds with information about his own case, and nothing more.''\n\nI asked him how such a rumor could get started. He pinned it on the same people who were the source of the continued press attention following his 2009 release from prison: Plaintiff lawyers spreading lies and looking to cash in on his wealth by representing women who he said falsely claimed to be victims.\n\nWhen I asked him to describe the sex acts that landed him in jail, albeit briefly, beginning in 2008 through 2009, he seemed to minimize what had occurred as nothing more than “erotic massages.”\n\n“So you didn’t really know the girls were underage?” I asked at one point. He agreed, stating that what happened to him “wasn’t that much different than what happened to Bob Kraft,” the owner of the New England Patriots, who just a couple of months earlier was charged with soliciting prostitution at a day spa in a Florida strip mall.\n\n“Only he went somewhere, and they came to me,” Epstein explained.\nThe other key difference, of course, is age: Epstein’s alleged victims were underage, as young as 14, according to the most recent indictment, while Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution from an adult (Kraft, according to a spokesman, was never arrested and his lawyers are working to get the case dismissed).\n\nEither way, Epstein wanted me to know that despite what I have been reading, he was not the pervert the media is making him out to be.\n“I just want you to know I’m not a pedophile,” he said, adding, “Maybe the only thing worse than being called a pedophile is being called a hedge fund manager,” he said with a slight laugh.\n\nEpstein always considered himself a money manager to billionaires, not someone who would hawk a retail product like a hedge fund to mere millionaires.\n\nThese were odd conversations; when I called, he would call me back almost immediately, but he was eager to end the conversation quickly. I couldn’t tell if this was just his frenetic nature or he was limiting how much information he wanted to provide.",

I had no particular ill-will toward him and that people I knew said they knew him to be a decent guy.\n\n“Yeah, Charlie,” I remember him responding, “It’s hard to believe that not so long ago ''people actually thought I was a good guy''. And now people are ashamed to say they knew me.”\n\nAll told, I spoke to Epstein about three times in March of this year. His comments did help infuse this piece I wrote for FOX Business that debunked the notion that he was a Wall Street cooperator, and another article in early August that described his Wall Street connections and his attempts to rebuild some semblance of a business after returning from jail in 2009.\n\nA lot happened to him since then; the press frenzy didn’t abate. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York – one of the nation's premier law enforcement agencies – had indeed been investigating Epstein for months, putting together a bigger, more damning federal indictment ''that accused Epstein and unnamed employees of his in multi-state child sex trafficking ring'' that could have put the 66-year-old financier in jail for the rest of his life if, of course, he had lived to see his trial.\n>With info put together via Virginia Roberts re: Ghislane Maxwell = INTERNATIONAL RING\n\nThe Miami Herald's reporting on the Epstein's lenient sentencing reverberated in Washington. It was then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Miami, Alex Acosta, who most recently served as President Trump’s Secretary of Labor, who cut an unusual plea deal a decade ago with Epstein’s high-powered team on state charges of prostitution that put him in jail for a little longer than a year.\n\nEpstein would have to register as a sex offender and pay victim restitution, but the deal was done without consulting the victims’ lawyers who could have objected to its lenient terms (Acosta resigned from the Trump administration last month over his handling of the Epstein case, but he maintains he cut the best deal possible given the evidence that was available, and vetted the agreement with his supervisors in the Justice Department).\n\nEpstein was right about one thing: People who once thought he was a great guy continued to abandon him in droves. His old client and mentor, Wexner, issued a statement first saying the two haven’t done business since the financier’s conviction a decade earlier, and then stating Epstein had stolen money from him.\nEpstein’s business relationships had largely disappeared; no major bank would now take his money. Former friends said they barely knew him. Trump had to answer for his prior relationship with the disgraced money man, including a 2002 quote where he stated: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”\n\nAfter Epstein's arrest, Trump said: \"I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years. I wasn't a fan.\"\n\nBill Clinton, likewise, sought to minimize his contact with someone he once described this way: “Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science.”\n\nI placed a few more calls to Epstein on the day of his arrest, but the telephone simply rang off the hook. The following day, the feds raided his Manhattan townhouse looking for additional evidence. They found a Saudi passport and, even worse for Epstein, a trove of nude photographs of young girls who prosecutors said appeared to be underage, leading to possibly more charges. Since his arrest, Epstein hadn’t made any public comments aside from his not guilty plea.\n\nHe appeared to attempt suicide once, unsuccessfully, after being placed in a Manhattan federal jail.\nEven after Epstein's death, his lawyers haven’t said much aside from some initial statements calling the government’s case a do-over of the old charges that they will fight vigorously in court so the full truth can come out.\n\nThat, of course, is not going to happen, which is why I think there is something important about hearing Epstein in his own words explain and rationalize his behavior without the cloak of secrecy.\n\nI wish I had more from him because we learn about evil by watching it unravel before our eyes.",

The financier had been returning from Paris when authorities had arrested him on sex trafficking charges in July in New Jersey.\n>AFAIK we've only found 1 property of his in Paris (in this or last thread)...\n\nVirginia Roberts Giuffre, one of several women who accused Epstein of sexual assault, also said she flew to Paris with Epstein as a teenager in 2001. Epstein’s alleged co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell also joined the couple on the 2001 trip, according to ABC News.\n\nCourt documents state that Giuffre said there was an instance in which Maxwell “sent [her] to have sex with the owner of a large hotel chain” in Paris. Maxwell had denied the claims and had not been charged with a crime.\n\nFBI agents have already begun investigating Epstein’s property in the Caribbean and have launched an investigation into his Manhattan jail cell.\n\n",

Much of it appears to be relatively innocuous, discussing a one-month trip Tarrant says he took to Russia in 2015. ''But the letter also warns that a \"great conflict\" is coming and uses language that could be construed as a call to arms,'' the Associated Press reported.\n\nPrisoners in New Zealand have rights that include the ability to send and receive mail, according to Davis. He said the prison system can withhold correspondence, and did withhold other letters Tarrant attempted to send or receive.\n\nBut \"we have never had to manage a prisoner like this before — and I have asked questions around whether our laws are now fit for purpose and asked for advice on what changes we may now need to make,\" he added.\n\nA New Zealand parliament member said Davis needs to demand immediate answers as to how such a letter could be sent from inside a maximum-security prison.\n\n\"This man is accused of carrying out one of the most heinous crimes in New Zealand history,\" David Bennett, the parliament member, said in a statement. \"New Zealanders will be horrified that Corrections allowed him to send a letter which includes a call to action and has subsequently been posted online.\"\n\nThe Corrections Department, which oversees prisons, said New Zealand law only allows a prison director to withhold a prisoner's mail in a \"very limited\" range of circumstances.\n\n\"On review, we acknowledge that this letter should have been withheld,\" said the department. \"We have made changes to the management of this prisoner's mail to ensure that our robust processes are as effective as we need them to be.\"",

			"body": "==William Barr Is the Wrong Person to Lead the Jeffrey Epstein Investigation==\nBy Joyce White Vance 8:14 PM EDT \nhttps://time.com/5650974/william-barr-jeffrey-epstein/\nhttps://archive.fo/6yYzA\n\nJeffrey Epstein is dead. His victims will never have their day in court, at least not with this defendant. It is critical that the Justice Department conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances of his death. But how it is handled is also critical to the integrity of DOJ. '''That is why Attorney General William Barr needs to recuse himself.'''\n\nSix months before that, at his confirmation hearing, Barr was asked if he would investigate the handling of a decade-old Florida plea deal that let Epstein escape responsibility for his conduct. He said he thought his former law firm was involved in the case so he might have to recuse. ''Although Barr did ultimately recuse from an investigation into the Florida case, he did not from SDNY’s case.''\n>halp, halp he's actually going to see this through & not bury it like usual!\n\nThis is concerning. In addition to the law-firm conflict, Alex Acosta, who served in Donald Trump’s Cabinet with Barr, was the U.S. Attorney in Miami when Epstein received his travesty of a plea deal. And Barr’s father was the headmaster of an elite New York City school that hired college dropout Epstein to teach math and physics. Do these circumstances amount to a conflict of interest requiring mandatory recusal? Barr, apparently after consulting with career ethics officials at DOJ, concluded they did not. But the appearance of impropriety, particularly given the President’s past relationship with Epstein and concerns that Barr had acted as the President’s lawyer rather than the people’s with regard to the Russia investigation, should have dictated that he recuse from the SDNY case.\n\nBarr’s tenure as Attorney General has left a large segment of the country with questions, not just about DOJ ''but also about where his personal loyalties lie.'' Given his misleading summary of the Mueller report, no matter how objective his leadership is in this matter, there will be doubts about the outcome. Conspiracy theories, including those retweeted by the President, will continue to circulate, and we will have one more situation that erodes the already ebbing faith that people are willing to place in the institution Barr leads.\n\nAnd yet if the past is prologue, he will not recuse. When it emerged during his confirmation process that he had sent an unsolicited memo to DOJ and the White House arguing that it cannot be obstruction of justice when a President does “facially-lawful” acts that involve an exercise of his constitutional authority, like firing an appointee, many people, myself included, suggested he take himself out of the running to replace Jeff Sessions. He did not.\n\nIt is often said that DOJ’s integrity is like a reservoir, slow to fill but easily emptied by a small leak. The reservoir is leaking. The day after news of Epstein’s apparent suicide broke, a tweet from the partisan podcast Mueller, She Wrote articulated the worst case: “Whether you believe there are nefarious forces within the DoJ that assisted with or turned a blind eye to the Epstein death, the bigger point is no one trusts the department of justice. No one.” We are in a dangerous place if people no longer trust that the Justice Department is doing justice.\n> slow to fill but easily emptied by a small leak\n< oh, the irony!!\n\n\">Whether you believe there are nefarious forces within the DoJ that assisted with or turned a blind eye to the Epstein death, the bigger point is no one trusts the department of justice. No one.\"\n  — Mueller, She Wrote Podcast (@MuellerSheWrote) August 11, 2019\n\n“Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered,” Barr said in a statement. “In addition to the FBI’s investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death.” But as Attorney General, Barr would still be the ultimate authority over the investigation.\n\nHow did a high-profile, high-risk prisoner have access to items he could use to hang himself? What procedures were and weren’t followed? These questions must be answered. If Barr cares about DOJ’s reputation, '''he should step aside and let ''career people'' conduct and oversee the investigation.''' If he does this, and if the investigation is exhaustive with results promptly made public, it would be a step in the long process of restoring faith in our justice system. All of us — especially Epstein’s victims, who have already been subjected to unthinkable trauma — are entitled to no less.\n>let our people handle this case and make it go away, too many of us are threatened to be exposed!!",

			"body": "==FTC chairman says he's prepared to break up Silicon Valley giants==\nby Melissa Quinn  | August 14, 2019 01:58 PM \nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ftc-chairman-says-hes-prepared-to-break-up-silicon-valley-giants\nhttps://archive.fo/CIUQk\n\nSilicon Valley’s most prominent players, already under scrutiny from the Justice Department over antitrust issues, may see their dominance further threatened by a Federal Trade Commission whose chief says he would be willing to break up the companies.\n\nJoe Simons, who serves as the commission’s chairman, told Bloomberg in an interview he would consider unwinding past acquisitions made by the firms as a means of fostering competition and curtailing their power.\n\n“If you have to, you do it,” Simons said. “It’s not ideal because it’s very messy. But if you have to, you have to.”\n\nBig tech companies have found themselves in the crosshairs of the FTC and Justice Department as they have grown in power and size, making it tougher for smaller, newer competitors to get into the marketplace.\n\nIn February, the commission launched a technology task force designed to monitor competition in the sector and investigate any anticompetitive conduct, and Facebook acknowledged in financial filings last month that it had been targeted by the agency.\n\nIn the 15 years since the Menlo Park, California-based company was launched by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, it has acquired Instagram, a photo-sharing platform, and WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging service. Both blockbuster deals were approved by the FTC, which oversees enforcement of federal antitrust laws, but it has the power to reverse itself.\n\nThe commission, Simons said, could say “we made a mistake,” though any undoing of the deals would need to be approved by a court.\n\nThe FTC’s scrutiny of the industry runs alongside a broad antitrust review of “market-leading online platforms” launched by the Justice Department last month to examine how the tech giants gained market power and whether they engaged in practices that stifle competition or harm consumers.\n\nThe parallel investigations suggest the FTC and Justice Department \"could be investigating the same company at the same time but just for different conduct,” Simons told Bloomberg.\n\nAs Silicon Valley’s giants expand, political leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for the companies to be broken up. 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren urged the government in March to take apart Amazon, Google, and Facebook and argued doing so would allow the next generation of tech companies to thrive. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has also proposed antitrust action against tech firms.\n\nZuckerberg, meanwhile, has embraced the prospect of more government regulation of his company and other platforms, but has spurned calls for Facebook to be broken up. Such a move against the company, which has 2.4 billion monthly users, would only make it more challenging to address issues like user privacy and the proliferation of harmful content on the platform, he said.\n\nBut Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes disagrees, calling Zuckerberg’s power “unprecedented and un-American.”\n\n",

Bonanno had an illegal, loaded Glock semiautomatic handgun in the vehicle of his friend, who had driven him to the bar, authorities said.\n\n\"The police were contacted by someone who heard the defendant say he wanted to kill his wife and family, and the witness also believed this defendant to be armed,\"chief John Constanzo told reporters.\n\nBonanno, of East Shore Road, was charged with several counts of second- and third-degree criminal possession of a weapon and officials said more charges are expected to be filed. He was arraigned Tuesday in Tuckahoe Village Court and held without bail at the Westchester County jail.\n\nInformation on his attorney, if any, was not available Wednesday night.\n\nAuthorities praised the person who called police. \"Without that individual coming forward,\" Luisi said, \"this amount of weaponry would have been out on the streets and Lord knows what would have happened.\"\nhttps://archive.fo/IYWn8\n\n>This amount of weapons IS on the streets and shit happens all the time, esp in certain areas\nI saw an interview with some famous rappers (I don't know who they are) who all said that boxes of exotic weapons were dropped off near train tracks, in alleys & so on.

The event took place June 6-9, 2002.\n\nEpstein’s private planes’ flight records, released by one of his former pilots, David Rodgers, show that one of Epstein’s jets arrived in Dublin on June 7, 2002, and left the next day, with the millionaire on board.\n\nThe Colombian politician denied having been at Epstein’s “now infamous” private island in the Caribbean, off the coast of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, where the millionaire took famous guests allegedly to have sex with minors.\n\nFlight records show that Pastrana was aboard one of Epstein’s private planes that left on March 20, 2003, from New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport headed to Palm Beach International Airport. Pastrana also appears in the manifest of another flight the next day from Palm Beach to Nassau International Airport in the Bahamas.\n\nRecords show Epstein, his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, and model executive Jean-Luc Brunel, on both flights. According to the documents, they all returned to Palm Beach, without Pastrana, from the Bahamas on March 23.\n\nThe trip to Cuba, however, does not appear either in Rodgers’ records or in the records kept by the Federal Aviation Administration and obtained by the Miami Herald.\n\nIf Epstein traveled to the island, he might have wanted to avoid public scrutiny, since Americans are banned from traveling to Cuba for tourism.\n\n“It was probably unlawful travel,” said attorney Robert Muse, an expert on the U.S. embargo against Cuba. “At that time, there were very few categories of authorized trips, and it is not clear that he would have qualified under one of them.”\n\nUnder the George W. Bush administration, there were only a few categories of American travelers allowed to travel to the island, including Cuban Americans on family visits and academics to do research, the lawyer said.\n\nIn 2003, Castro, who died in 2016, was still president and Epstein had not yet been indicted. The invitation to the American tycoon would not have been an unusual gesture, because Castro liked to surround himself with foreign personalities.\n\nFor his part, Pastrana maintained a close relationship with Castro, who became involved in the peace process in Colombia during negotiations between the government and the National Liberation Army (ELN, in Spanish).\n\nAn el Nuevo Herald report at the time said Pastrana was in Havana in April 2003. According to the article, he was writing a book on his role in the failed peace negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym FARC. There was speculation that Castro himself would write the foreword, but the book was published in 2005 with an introduction by Clinton.\n\nThe relations, however, cooled under the government of his brother, Raúl Castro. In March 2018, Pastrana and the former president of Bolivia, Jorge Quiroga, were expelled from Cuba when they tried to enter the country to collect the Oswaldo Payá Award, named after the well-known Cuban dissident.\n\nFollowing an investigation by the Miami Herald last year, Epstein was arrested in New York in July, accused of sex trafficking of minors. Despite his death, the Department of Justice has pledged to continue investigations into those who helped or participated in the abuses.",

Nestel \nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/jeffrey-epsteins-bodyguard-igor-zinoviev-on-his-old-boss.html\n\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/jeffrey-epsteins-bodyguard-igor-zinoviev-on-his-old-boss.html\n\n\nYou were in New York also? \n>Yeah.\n\nYou drove him in all three places?\n>In New York, I didn’t drive him. In New York, he had a driver, whatever his name was. He was like old family. I was just training with him in New York and travel with him. And I just drove him here in Palm Beach. Because other places he had different drivers. They’re just personnel, you know, who just drive him. Somebody drive him in New Mexico. Somebody drive him in Virgin Islands, actually. I just drove him here in Palm Beach.\n\nYou went with him to all the other properties? Did you go with him to New Mexico also?\n>Yeah.\n\nYou worked with him and traveled with him 24/7 — so that means you were on his plane with him, correct?\n>Yeah.\n\nYou lived in his guest house?\n>Yeah.\n\nYou lived alone in the guest house?\n>Of course. In Palm Beach — when we stay at Palm Beach, we have a guest house, and there’s a property manager who lived there. He was working there before me. It was a Polish guy, yeah.\n\nWhat were some of the places that you drove him to?\n>I mean, when I used to work here in Palm Beach? Just business meeting, basically. It was mostly downtown, near lawyer’s office. I drop him there and he go upstairs and I waiting in the car.\n\n\nEver talk about his case? Why he was in trouble?\n>No. He never talked about that stuff.\n\nNever talked about any of that stuff?\n>No.\n\nReally?\n>No.\n\nIn our conversation in 2015, you described his relationship with teenage girlfriends: “So many time I tried to stop him. I try to tell tell him my opinion about that. He don’t listen to me. That’s the reason why I’m not working for him no more. I make him do that — to let me go.” Do you remember saying that?\n>It’s not the teenage girls. I never see the teenage girls. I tell you I never see teenage girls.\n\nPlenty of times when I work for him I never see anything unproper or teenage girls around him.\n>That’s what I say.\n\nSo now you say you only saw him with women? Older than 18? 20?\n>All what I say he has always been with girlfriends and there was a couple girls — I don’t remember their names. She was 25 and worked for him as assistant. Maybe 25 or 23 — whatever, I don’t know the age.\n\nOkay. But you definitely told me that last time we talked. \n\nIt’s exactly what you said. I can send it to you. Here’s something else you said: “It could be tricky you know. Normally he always checks his newspapers — ‘Nothing about me?’ I say, ‘No!’ He say, ‘They forget about me?’” And when I mentioned Epstein was being exposed for messing with teenage girls, you said: “I’m not surprised at all. I’m just surprised how low he can be outside the real world. Someday is going to call him and it will be real jail. He have so much money he can pay it off. Me personally, if I caught him with my daughter or something do that — I’m not going to go to police. I do something else. Much worse. That guy could try to sue me and manipulate the situation with his money. That’s the American way. I know he screwed up a lot of fashion girls also. That’s a different story. [Laughs.]” Do you remember saying that?\n\nIt was four years ago. You may not remember what you told me. I kept very good notes of what you and I said. It must come across as very harsh. But it’s the truth. I’m happy to understand a little better. He’s not alive. ''You don’t have anything to be afraid of anymore.''\n>I’m not afraid. Beyond that just he is dead. I don’t want anything to be uncorrect. There’s too much shit in here, you know, already. He’s dead and just like, freaking people, just leave him alone.\n\nHold on. When did you find out he died?\n>Saturday or Sunday or whenever.\n\nWhat did you think when you found that out?\n>What did I think?\n\nYeah. \n>Are you sure you want to hear what I am going to think?\n\nYeah. \n>Somebody helped him to do that.\n\nYou think somebody helped him kill himself?\n>Yeah.\n\n1/2",

Seriously.\n\nCan you tell me why?\n>I can’t. I can’t.\n\nMay I ask you one more question? \n>Go ahead.\n\nHave you been talking to anyone in the government, the FBI?

			"body": "==Trump's purge of his own national security team is almost complete==\nBy Zachary Cohen, CNN\nUpdated 1814 GMT (0214 HKT) August 15, 2019\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/dni-coats-gordon-last-day/index.html\nhttps://archive.fo/PhRf4\n\nWhen Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and his deputy Sue Gordon leave their offices for the last time on Thursday, it will mark a turning point for an administration that has already endured the highest level of senior staff turnover in history.\nBoth Coats, who took on the role of intelligence chief in 2017, and Gordon, who started as his deputy a few months later, have outlasted a slew of their national security colleagues who left the Trump administration at various points over the last two years.\nThis \"is a defining day in the Trump administration's national security structure -- they have finally cleared out all the national security positions in terms of senior officials,\" said David Priess, a former CIA official who delivered the president's daily briefing in the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\n\"With all the twists and turns in the Trump administration and the national security establishment and intelligence community over the past two years, at least there has been stability in one way -- the DNI and his principal deputy have quietly remained an island of steadiness,\" Priess said. \"As of August 15, that changes.\"\nTrump's relationship with the intelligence community has been fraught from the very inception of his presidency, when the country's most senior spies and security chiefs sat the newly minted leader down to brief him about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that Moscow had material that could potentially compromise him.\nSince taking office, Trump has repeatedly clashed with intelligence officials, including Coats, over their public comments acknowledging Russia not only interfered in 2016, but also poses a threat to future elections -- an assessment that was reaffirmed by former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which the President often characterized as a \"political witch hunt.\"\nCoats also drew Trump's ire when he appeared to contradict him on various issues during a Senate hearing earlier this year. Still, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said that Coats' dedication to speaking the \"truth\" was a quality they not only respected, but believe is a prerequisite for any nominee to replace him.\nSimilarly, Gordon was widely viewed, both within the intelligence community and among Congressional lawmakers, as an experienced official with the integrity and professionalism to tell the President facts he might not want to hear.\nHowever, White House officials have told CNN that the President was never going to allow Gordon to assume the acting or permanent position due to her perceived ties to intelligence officials like former CIA Director John Brennan and even Coats.\n\n    Thank you, DNI Coats and PDDNI Gordon, for your leadership and service to our country. pic.twitter.com/PN67clMxsC\n    — Office of the DNI (@ODNIgov) August 15, 2019\n\nWhen discussing his attempt to replace Coats with Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas on July 30, the '''President told reporters that the intelligence community needed \"somebody like that that's strong and can really rein it in. As you've all learned, the intelligence agencies have run amok. They've run amok.\"'''\nCoats' and Gordon's departures are \"a story that combines two different issues that have become entangled with each other,\" according to George Beebe, director of the Intelligence Project Center for a New National Interest.\nOne issue, he said, involves \"the management and leadership of the intelligence community itself and the role it's playing and should play in our national security system. The second is a domestic political story that has to do with Trump's election, his presidency, his agenda for his presidency and the fact that there are an awful lot of people in Washington and in the country who are fundamentally opposed to the Trump presidency,\" he said.\nBeebe told CNN that it is difficult to understand the importance of Coats, Gordon and whoever the new leaders of the ODNI turn out to be, without getting into that domestic political story.\n\"The intelligence community is not supposed to be playing a political role in our tradition,\" he added. \"We're not supposed to have a secret police ... normally the impulse Americans have and Congress has and the media has is to want to place constraints on the intelligence community, to make sure they're staying within the lines.\"\n1/?",

People are seeing the intelligence community not as something that should be constrained, but something that should constrain the President,\" Beebe said.\nUntil Trump picks a nominee, Joseph Maguire, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, will serve as the acting Director of National Intelligence.\nA US intelligence official told CNN that Maguire is well respected among career professionals, particularly due to his military background.\nMaguire is also seen as an experienced hand at a time when the US faces a myriad of national security challenges.\nTensions with Iran are escalating in the Persian Gulf, North Korea continues to develop its weapons capabilities, arms control experts warn of a potential nuclear arms race with Russia and trade tensions with China are intensifying, while Trump is discussing a drawdown of forces in Afghanistan and Syria.\nTrump left the door open to nominating Maguire for the full-time job last week, but his future remains uncertain.\nTrump&#39;s &#39;excellent&#39; acting intel chief may not be loyalist he wants\nRelated Article: Trump's 'excellent' acting intel chief may not be loyalist he wants\nMeanwhile, Gordon's role will remain vacant, though Maguire can choose someone to perform those duties in the interim.\nFor both positions, the decision lies with Trump, but the White House's list of candidates for the DNI role has only grown in recent weeks, with no indication that a nomination is coming soon.\nAnd if Trump's track record of dealing with national security vacancies is any indication, Maguire could serve in an acting capacity for a while.\nOver the months that multiple geopolitical crises have been brewing, and since Trump took office, he has plowed through a Cabinet's worth of national security professionals. \n\nCabinet churn\nThe President has run through two national security advisers -- Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster. There have been rumblings of his unhappiness with his most recent pick, John Bolton. Trump has summarily fired a secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, by tweet after undercutting the former ExxonMobile CEO for months.\nSecretary of Defense Jim Mattis resigned, reportedly in frustration over Trump's decision to pull out of Syria.\nThe President has churned through two Homeland Security secretaries, John Kelly and Kirstjen Nielson, and a National Security Agency director, Mike Rogers. He's lost a deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland and an ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. Michael Pompeo, Trump's former CIA director, has held on but moved over to helm the State Department.\nAmid that churn, Coats and Gordon have been a steady, stabilizing influence, Priess said.\nSpy chief debacle sends Trump back to the drawing board\nRelated Article: Spy chief debacle sends Trump back to the drawing board\n\"The very fact that in this administration with the highest turnover in history, the people who are specifically designated to tell the truth to the President, whether he likes it or not, have remained in place, doing that day after day, means that by definition, they have been an island of stability,\" Priess added.\nWhile Trump's decision to name Maguire as the acting replacement has appeared to be well received, he remains somewhat of an enigma despite his impressive military credentials and counterterrorism experience. Maguire is not widely considered to be part of the intelligence \"establishment,\" and sources close to him have told CNN that he has likely had limited interactions with the President.\nBut Maguire said that he has no problem speaking truth to power during the confirmation hearing for his job at the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\n    PDDNI Sue Gordon today sent this farewell message to IC workforce. pic.twitter.com/EGcR11F3D1\n    — Office of the DNI (@ODNIgov) August 15, 2019\n\n\"I promise to tell the truth and to be able to represent the information and the hard analysis from the intelligence community professionals as accurately and as forthcoming as I possibly can, and I am more than willing to speak truth to power,\" he told Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nWarner again emphasized the importance of that quality in a statement last week.\n\"When I supported Admiral Maguire's previous nomination, I made it clear I expected him to empower the intelligence professionals he led to do their important work free from political interference. Given the circumstances of his appointment as Acting DNI, it is more important than ever that Admiral Maguire stands by that commitment to speak truth to power,\" he said.\n\n2/3",

Answering questions about various topics including gun control legislation, the president asserted, \"We're looking at the whole gun situation. I do want people to remember the words 'mental illness,' these people are mentally ill.\"\n\nTrump then took the opportunity to share possible solutions to mental illness in the U.S., which he believes play a key role in violent gun attacks. \"And nobody talks about that, but these are mentally ill people ... I think we have to start building institutions again,\" he suggested. \"If you look at the '60s and '70s, so many of these institutions were closed, and the people were just allowed to go onto the streets, and that was a terrible thing for our country.\"\n\nDiscussing why state-run mental facilities declined, the president said, \"Cities couldn't afford them, and they closed them. I can tell you in New York they closed a lot of them, and the people went out, they went out onto the streets.\"\n\n\"A lot of our conversation has to do with the fact that we have to open up institutions. We can't let these people be on the streets,\" Trump concluded.\nVIDEO: https://youtu.be/TuyOfZS0INs\n\n..............\nThis may be an unpopular opinion, but POTUS is right. Across the US, many facilities emptied wings or closed completely, letting thousands of people out on their own, onto the streets. You know those people pushing shopping carts full of their belongings, talking to themselves, picking things out of the air? That's them.\n\nI watched as all these people who cannot take care of themselves were thrust out onto cities, with no support, no where to go, no way to support themselves, overwhelmed by the noise, amount of people and everything else. These homeless get taken advantage of by other homeless, other unscrupulous people, get sick and don't get treated. They don't typically inhabit the homeless shelters either. It's a bit heartbreaking.\n\nOf course there is the possibility that institutions are engaged in abuse, low level of care, people can abuse the statutes to have someone committed that shouldn't be - just like any gov't program or law(s). But there really are people who will never get \"better\" and cannot take care of themselves, and their families (if they have any) are not equipped to take care of them.",

It was determined safe just after 9:40 a.m., according to cops.\n\nPolice urged straphangers to avoid the Fulton Street subway station because of the first two packages, which were reported by a 911 caller.\n\nThe station was evacuated out of “an abundance of caution,” a police spokesperson said, before the Bomb Squad cleared the devices\n\nIn a tweet, the department said, “Expect a police presence and emergency vehicles in the area. Check @NYCTSubway for possible schedule changes. More info to follow.”\n\nNew Yorkers appeared to be generally unfazed by the scare and took it in stride.\n\n“It’s good that they’re taking all these precautions but it seems like it was deemed safe so I think we’re a little anxious to get back to our day,” said Joe Vieitez, 28, who works nearby.\n\nTherese Brand, 61, of Queens, said she left her office when she got an alert on an app — but insisted that “no terrorist is going to scare me from doing my job.”\n\n“If a bomb goes off, that building is coming down and we’ll be in the middle of it,” she said, but added: “I’m used to a lot of this stuff. I was working at 30 Main St. when I saw the towers go down on 9/11.”\n\nDelays and changes to service were reported on the 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, J and Z lines due to the investigation, according to the MTA.\n>bcde131026\n",

The rules state that migrants from Central American countries who pass through other countries must be denied refugee status in those nations before being eligible to apply in the United States.\n\nThe decision on Friday upholds a July 24 decision by a Northern District of California judge to block Trump's rules but only within the 9th Circuit. The July injunction was ruled on just hours after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled to uphold the asylum restrictions. ''The 9th Circuit's Friday ruling cited that the trial judge who blocked the rules nationwide did not have the right to do so.

The court papers note that Epstein’s only potential heir was his brother, Mark Epstein. But the will adds that Mark ''only had a claim to his brother’s extensive holdings if Jeffrey hadn’t left behind the document''.\n>article includes an embedded document so you can read the whole thing.",

He should be able to separate the \"deep fake\" from real, no?\nHe spoke amid alarming concerns over deepfake technology raising eyebrows online, including a recent viral video of comedian Bill Hader morphing into actor Tom Cruise.\n>Morphing video - how convincing!\n\nAnd Shamir warns it is only a matter of time before the technology creeps its way into the global judicial system.\n\nHe told Daily Star Online: \"Initially, deepfakes will be manipulations of existing audio/video evidence, such as that from CCTV, voice recorders, police body cams, and bystanders’ cell phones.\n\n\"Humans have notoriously weak hearing as compared to our sight: I would bet that we get fooled by fake audio first.\n\n\"It is also much easier to create believable fake audio than it is to create believable fake video.\n\n\"In the future, video will be generated from scratch, with no basis in actual footage.\"\nWhat's more, Shamir believes the technology will become readily available and easy to use.\n\nAnd he claims it will even become as simple as dragging someone's Facebook photo and manipulating it.\nHe continued: \"A bad actor will simply type 'make Sally do this' and the AI tech will pull Sally’s Facebook pics and swiftly generate the fake video of the requested action.\n\n\"He will then type a few sentences and the AI will pull Sally’s previous recordings, generate synthetic audio based on it, sync the mouth movements, and Sally will 'say' things – in her voice – that she had never ever said.\n\n\"The bad actor will need no technical expertise, only the ability to type.\"\n\nHe added: \"Due process will be compromised without video veracity solutions: innocent people will be wrongfully convicted on manufactured evidence and guilty people will be off the hook for raising doubt as to the authenticity of the visual evidence against them.\"\n>How handy he has a \"video veracity\" company!\n\nSo far, deepfake pornographic material of celebrities has been widely viewed online.\nAnd in politics, deepfake videos of politicians including ex-US President Barack Obama have gone viral.\n__There are growing fears the use of deepfake technology could interfere with the 2020 US Presidential election.__\n\nNOTHING CAN STOP WHAT'S COMING\nNOTHING!!!\n",

The two were separated before Epstein hanged himself on Aug. 10. -New York Post\n\nEpstein told his lawyers that Tartaglione had \"roughed him up\" according to a previous report by the Post. The ex-cop's lawyer, Bruce Barket said in response \"I do know that Nick was not brought up on any charges at all in the institution, so they cleared him.\" \n\nIn his request for transfer, the 51-year-old Tartaglione said he was told there would be a \"price to pay\" if he talks about Epstein's death. \n\"The clear message Mr. Tartaglione has received is that if he conveys information about the facility or about [Epstein’s] recent suicide, there will be a price to pay,\" reads the letter from Barket. \n\n\"Whether or not the investigators into the suicide chose to interview Mr. Tartaglione about the attempted suicide to which he was witness or about how the facility is run and the conditions under which the inmates are forced to live, the correction officers know he has information potentially very damaging to the very people now charged with guarding him or their coworkers.\" \nBarket also decried the \"deplorable\" conditions at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), including \"a serious rodent and insect infestation.\" \n\nTartaglione faces the death penalty for his alleged involvement in four drug-related murders. Feds claim the ex-cop and an accomplice lured Martin Luna to a Chester, NY lounge to find stolen cocaine money and instead ended up killing Luna and three other men he had brought for protection. ",

One of the suits allege that Epstein continued to have sex with underage girls while he was on work release serving a Florida jail sentence under the watch of sheriff's deputies.\n\nThe suits, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by women identified only as Katlyn Doe, Lisa Doe and Priscilla Doe, name seven businesses or foundations alleged to have assisted Epstein as respondents in addition to the estate of Epstein, who was found dead by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell this month.\n\nThe lawsuits seek unspecified damages at jury trials.\n\nTwo of the suits allege activities similar to those claimed in actions brought against Epstein by other women — allegations of sex procured from teenagers with charm, gifts, promises of money and lucrative careers, and threats.\n\nThe most explosive allegations are detailed in the third suit, filed by Katlyn Doe, which claims that Epstein blackmailed her when she was 17 to have sex with him by promising to pay for expensive surgery she needed and then threatening to see to it that she would never get treatment if she refused.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the activities began before, and continued during and after, Epstein's jail sentence in Florida, where he was granted generous work release privileges to conduct business affairs at the Florida Science Foundation.\n\nEpstein created the foundation a few months before he began serving his sentence in 2008 on state charges of soliciting a prostitute and of procuring an underage girl for prostitution. He dissolved it shortly after he finished serving the community service requirements of his sentence through the foundation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, its main purpose was to give Epstein a haven from jail where he could prey on young women under the watch of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, which provided off-duty deputies to guard him. The sheriff's office said last month that it was re-investigating the arrangement.\n\nKatlyn continued to have sex with Epstein believing he would eventually pay for her medical treatment, according to the lawsuit. Then, in 2013, he made a new request, it says.\n\nAccording to the suit, a woman described as a \"non-United States citizen and recruiter of females for Jeffrey Epstein\" needed permanent U.S. residence so she could remain in the country, and to get it, Epstein arranged for Katlyn to marry the woman in New York, where same-sex marriage had been legalized two years earlier. He continued to have sex with Katlyn during the first few months of the marriage, the suit alleges.\n\nBy the next year, however, Katlyn had turned 25 and was \"too old\" for Epstein, who forced her to move out of one of his apartments in Manhattan, leaving her homeless, it says.\n\nKatlyn and her wife remained married until 2017, when they divorced, having fulfilled Epstein's conditions, according to the suit. But Epstein stiffed Katlyn, refusing to pay her a balance of $10,000 that they had agreed upon, it says.\n\nTo make matters worse, the suit alleges, Epstein also refused to follow through on his promise to pay for Katlyn's medical care. She still has never had the surgery she needs, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe three lawsuits, drafted and filed by the same law firm, describe a far-reaching network of Epstein-controlled companies and foundations that employed scores of \"disciples\" devoted to serving his desires.\n\n\"The main and in many instances only function of each of the associates who acted at the instruction or direction of Epstein was to recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, obtain, maintain, or solicit young females, knowing that fraud or coercion would be used to cause each female, including Plaintiff, to engage in a commercial sex act,\" according to the suit filed by Priscilla Doe.\n\nThe lawsuits are filed against Epstein's estate, which he bequeathed to a trust he apparently created on Aug. 8, two days before he was found dead.

It's expected to be transmitted as early as next week to Attorney General William Barr and ''that will begin a process of declassification'',\" the investigative reporter told host Sean Hannity.\n\n\"I think we are still on track for that timeline, I've been saying on your show: mid-September to early October seems the most likely release point,\" Solomon said. \"It's going to be a tough report,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Barr's \"investigation into the investigators\" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review of the origins of the Russia investigation, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a \"deep dive\" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work. Over the past few days, the South Carolina Republican has said he expects Horowitz's findings to be \"damning and ugly\" for the DOJ.

Considering that the Maxwells are jews, it seems that the article about Seckel means that his 'mounting debts' were likely a situation in which he had taken advantage of other jews. They are not only allowed, but encouraged to defraud gentiles, but they are forbidden from this behavior toward fellow jews. When they cross that line, they will not be protected. A perfect example is Bernie Madoff.\n\nAnother angle is that The father Maxwell was a MOS asset, gathering intel, influence and affording them backdoor access via a specific program he sold. The cumulative nature of his acquisitions + Ghislane's gave her some protection, along with Epstein, for working for Israel's benefit. It has been postulated that Epstein may have tried to leverage that info (threaten to expose) in order to escape his legal confinement, and that was a bridge too far for the little desert state.\n\nGhislane, meanwhile, has only a part of the leverage and is now toxic, but leverage is leverage and she is desperate. She could of course flee to Israel, but that's too dangerous to them, it's too close a link and would be really too obvious. She is really in a pickle and it makes her a liability. The fact that her families' quirks & backgrounds are making note is an interesting development, and shows that her protection is being removed.",

			"body": "JW gets the goods!\n==Hundreds of pages of emails show Nellie Ohr researched Trump-Russia connections==\nby Jerry Dunleavy  | August 25, 2019 10:00 AM \nhttps://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hundreds-of-pages-of-emails-show-nellie-ohr-researched-trump-russia-connections\nhttps://archive.fo/Qfaty\n\nNewly uncovered FBI documents show how Nellie Ohr fits into the Trump-Russia saga, documents that also paint an increasingly clearer picture of the Clinton-linked opposition research firm Fusion GPS's central role in 2016 and beyond.\n\nOhr, the wife of high-ranking DOJ official Bruce Ohr and a contractor for Fusion GPS in 2015 and 2016, put together reams of research purporting to show connections between Trump, his associates, his family, and numerous other figures, including those with ties to the Russian government. Bruce passed all of this information along to the FBI, showing the FBI was receiving Fusion GPS-linked information not just through the infamous \"dossier\" from British ex-spy Christopher Steele, but from the wife of a key DOJ official too.\n\nThe new documents, revealed by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch, detail hundreds of pages of emails between Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, and DOJ officials, and show Nellie’s research was delivered by Bruce to investigators after Trump won in 2016. Two large research documents — a “Who’s Who” of alleged Trump-Russia connections and a “Manafort Chronology” — were given to the FBI by Bruce in December 2016.\n\nThe newly-released emails show Bruce forwarded himself a spreadsheet sent by his wife titled “WhosWho19Sept2016.xlsx” on December 5, 2016. The spreadsheet listed 80 different people and groups — many affiliated with Russia — who Nellie and Fusion GPS were tracking, and purported to show “linkages” between at least 40 of them, and Trump and his family. Bruce provided this list to the FBI.\n\nThose scrutinized by Nellie and Fusion GPS over their “linkages” to Trump included global businessmen, lobbyists, and figures with alleged ties to Russian organized crime and intelligence.\n\nAras Agalarov and Emin Agalarov, a Russian billionaire and his son, are listed in connection to partnering with Trump, the Miss Universe owner, in hosting the pageant in Moscow in 2013. Steele’s dossier alleged it was at that event that the infamous “pee tape” of prostitutes with Trump was recorded by Russian intelligence. There is scant evidence outside Steele’s allegations that such a tape exists.\n\nWendi Deng, the ex-wife of News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch, made the list as a friend of Ivanka Trump and the possible girlfriend of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDavid John Geovanis, a Russian businessman, was on the list too. Geovanis is mentioned in a so-called second dossier compiled by activist Cody Sherarer, a longtime ally of the Clintons, and he was looked into by the Senate Intelligence Committee as recently as early 2019.\n\nSergei Millian, a Belarus-born real estate developer who claimed insights on Trump business activities in Russia, is on Nellie’s list. Millian was a source for Steele’s dossier.\n\nGiorgi Rtskhiladze, a Georgian-American businessman, is listed in part due to contacts with Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report detailed texts Rtskhiladze had with Cohen in 2016 about how he “stopped the flow” of “tapes” on Trump. Rtskhiladze believes the tapes were rumors with no factual basis, and criticized Mueller for the way his remarks were characterized.\n\nFelix Sater, a Russian mobster and felon, makes the list. Sater worked with Cohen on a possible Trump Tower Moscow project that ultimately never moved forward but that Cohen was convicted of lying to Congress about.\n\nNellie focused on Tevfik Arif, a Turkish real estate developer with ties to Russia, sending her husband dozens of pages of research. Arif was listed as one of the foreigners with “linkages” to Trump due to his alleged business ties to the future president.\n\nMichael Caputo, a former Trump campaign member and Roger Stone protegee, and Carter Page are also listed by Nellie over their ties to Trump.\n\nPaul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign executive, also makes the list, and Nellie created a timeline of his activities. Bruce sent himself a file titled on “Manafort Chronology updated 16 August 2016.docx” on Dec. 5, 2016. The multi-page report gives the highlights of some of Manafort’s shady activities around the world, including in Ukraine, from the 1970s through 2015.\n\nIn texts to colleagues Nellie shared with Bruce in late January 2017, just after BuzzFeed published the dossier, she talked about Russian intelligence officials being ousted or arrested. \nJW pdf: https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/JW-v-DOJ-Ohr-comms-production-6-01854.pdf",

This signals McCabe’s lawyers could be making a last-ditch effort to convince the top law enforcement officials not to prosecute the case.\nIf they were to bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to prove he knowingly and intentionally lied to investigators when he told them on two occasions that he did not remember authorizing Page to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter. McCabe corrected himself at a later time.\nPage, who worked as a special counsel to McCabe, told a grand jury in Washington, D.C., that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie. Page resigned from the bureau last year after it was discovered she had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she had an affair.\n<snip>\nThe investigation into McCabe has been lengthy — so long, in fact, the Times reported the term expired for grand jury hearing evidence. It began last year after Horowitz referred his findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Frustrated with the prolonged process, DOJ prosecutor Kamil Shields left the case and joined a private practice. Another assistant U.S. attorney, David Kent, is also no longer on the case.\nMcCabe is also likely still being scrutinized in Horowitz’s inquiry into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The surveillance warrant applications targeting Trump associate Carter Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, and McCabe was involved in the FISA approval process.",

From Bill Gates to Prince Andrew to Ehud Barak - the list of famous names associated with Epstein now includes filmmaker and accused pedophile Woody Allen, who was seen exiting the financier's Manhattan townhouse after a December, 2010 party in honor of another accused pedophile, Prince Andrew. \nAllen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn (who ex-wife Mia Farrow adopted when she was eight years old) were seen leaving the soire, however the two were spotted leaving the mansion on more than one occasion during Prince Andrew's stay, according to the Daily Mail.\nAs the Mail reports: \"The December 2 dinner was held in the mansion’s second-floor dining room. TV anchor Katie Couric, once the highest-paid female presenter in the US, sat alongside comedian Chelsea Handler, a close friend of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. Also there was George Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton turned £15 million-a-year ABC News host.\"  \nSo we can add the above names to the list of people with no problem hanging out with a pedophile. \n>The soiree is believed to have also been attended by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend.\n>Multiple Epstein accusers have claimed that Ms Maxwell ‘procured’ girls for the perverted millionaire. She denies the allegations.\n>Guests would have walked past bizarre erotic artwork en route to the dining room with its gleaming mahogany table, including a painting of Bill Clinton in red heels and a blue dress, a reference to the outfit worn by Monica Lewinsky when she performed a sex act on him. -Daily Mail\nSounds like quite the gathering...",

Whether this was Powell's intention is unclear, although as we said at the time, \"it certainly means that Trump is now de facto in charge of the Fed's monetary policy by way of US foreign policy, and it also means that as BofA wrote, \"the Fed is unintentionally underwriting the trade war.\"\nHere, the only thing one can perhaps add is that the Fed may very well be intentionally underwriting Trump's trade war. In either case, as Bank of America's chief economist Michelle Meyer said, such a circular framework is a problem for many reasons, and as the bank admits, it is worried about an adverse feedback loop where the trade war hinders economic growth, therefore prompting additional Fed easing, which in turn allows for greater trade war escalation.\nFast forward to today, when in what in retrospect may be seen as a watershed moment in exposing just how \"political\" the Federal Reserve always has been despite repeated lies by various officials claiming otherwise, none other than former Goldman chief economist and the former head of the NY Fed, Bill Dudley, after looking at the chart above and having realized that the Fed is underwriting Trump's trade war, made a \"modest proposal\" in a Bloomberg op-ed in which '''he advised Powell to take a political stand against enabling Trump's trade war, and potentially go so far as to push the economy into a recession to prevent Trump from getting reelected!'''\nEchoing what Powell said in his Jackson Hole speech, where he dedicated a section to Trump's ongoing trade wars, and blaming them for the Fed's rising inability to interfere in the US economy, Dudley begins with what is a clear political statement, arguing that \"Donald Trump’s trade war with China keeps undermining the confidence of businesses and consumers, worsening the economic outlook.\" \nit is only Bill Dudley's subjective opinion that Trump is making \"bad choices\" on trade policy, an argument that immediately becomes political when one considers that Trump was elected on a platform of, among other things, reducing the US-China trade deficit and, by extension, limiting China's economic growth which if left unchecked, would assure war between the two superpowers.\nNo, instead to Dudley, what a myopic Trump should focus on is today and tomorrow, and leave the long-term to someone else. In other words, do precisely what the Fed has been doing for decades, even though as Mark Carney recently hinted, it was the Fed's monetary policy, that has been responsible for much of the world's crises and wars. You won't find a discussion of that in Dudley's brief op-ed, however.\nGoing back to Dudley's argument, the former Goldman banker claims that \"such a harder line could benefit the Fed and the economy in three ways\".\n- First, it would discourage further escalation of the trade war, by increasing the costs to the Trump administration.\n- Second, it would reassert the Fed’s independence by distancing it from the administration’s policies.\n- Third, it would conserve much-needed ammunition, allowing the Fed to avoid further interest-rate cuts at a time when rates are already very low by historical standards.\n\nHere the narrative gets downright absurd, because while Dudley refers to the Fed as apolitical, underscoring that further in the next paragraph where he says that \"I understand and support Fed officials’ desire to remain apolitical\", he immediately refutes himself by admitting that the Fed has never been apolitical and in fact, it is the US central bank that, through its actions chooses who the US president is, to wit:\n>Central bank officials face a choice: enable the Trump administration to continue down a disastrous path of trade war escalation, or send a clear signal that if the administration does so, the president, not the Fed, will bear the risks — including the risk of losing the next election.\nAnd the punchline: \"There’s even an argument that the election itself falls within the Fed’s purview.\"\nTranslation: \"there is even an argument\", Dudley implies, '''that the Fed should crush the economy (arguably by hiking or not cutting rates) and start the next recession, thereby preventing Trump from getting re-elected.'''",

Each message contained “carterheavyindustries@gmail.com” in the metadata, suggesting that a copy of each message that passed through Hillary Clinton’s private, unauthorized server during her tenure as secretary of state was forwarded to the Gmail address in real-time. Rucker’s concern was amplified when he searched for “Carter Heavy Industries” on Google and came up with information for a Chinese company with a similar name.\nOn the same day, more than 1,600 miles away in Denver, Colorado, FBI agents interviewed Paul Combetta, the information technology aide who allegedly created the mystery Gmail account. Combetta told the agents that he used the account in February 2014 to transfer an archive of Clinton’s emails from her tenure as the secretary of state to the Clinton email server he was administering for Platte River Networks in Secaucus, New Jersey. As a result, “carterheavyindustries@gmail.com” ended up in the metadata of each message.\nWhile the existence of Combetta’s Gmail was revealed long ago, the curious name he picked for the account and the fact that it was embedded in the metadata of all but four of the emails provided to Congress became public on Aug. 14 this year, when Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) released a set of letters and documents resulting from the Senate Finance Committee’s investigation related to “carterheavyindustries@gmail.com.” In the last few pages of the document, a letter from the inspectors general of the Intelligence Community and the Justice Department concludes that they are not aware of any evidence linking Combetta to the Chinese company with a name similar to the Gmail he allegedly created.\n“I’m still curious—how did he come up with the name for the email and what has the FBI done to see if there are any connections between China and Combetta?” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) told The Epoch Times.\n“It may tell us, as we suspected, that they probably already knew about it and when they found out the Intel IG knew about it, then they had to at least ask a question about it to try to cover their rears.”\nWhile Grassley’s documents settled some of the mystery surrounding the Gmail account, the details within raise more questions than they answer. The revelation also exposes another blatant breach of security protocols in the handling of highly classified information by Clinton, her staff, and her lawyers.\nAt least eight of the email chains contained in the batch Combetta siphoned through the Gmail account were classified as top secret, the highest level of classification for government documents in the United States, at the time they were sent. In the hands of an adversary, top-secret information could cause “exceptionally grave damage” to the national security of the United States. At least 36 email chains contained secret information, of which disclosure to an unauthorized actor could cause “serious damage” to national security.\nIntelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough told Congress that some of the Clinton emails were classified at a level beyond top secret, meaning it was information so closely held that even members of Congress could not view it in a secure, compartmentalized facility.\nAccording to the Grassley documents, Combetta created the Gmail account in 2012. The IT aide told FBI investigators in his Feb. 28, 2016, interview that he used the same Gmail account to test email issues for his other clients, meaning that other email servers had been connected to “carterheavyindustries@gmail.com.” Neither the FBI nor the inspectors general have disclosed whether anyone other than Combetta had access to the Gmail account prior to 2015. The government has also not provided any evidence to show whether some of Combetta’s clients’ servers were still connected to the Gmail account at the time he used it to transfer Clinton’s email archive.\nDespite learning that Combetta transferred Clinton’s entire email archive through “carterheavyindustries@gmail.com,” the FBI waited for a month to apply for a search warrant for Combetta’s account. \nmoar at link",

Horowitz also found that although Comey didn’t disclose any classified information to the media, he did share a memo containing sensitive information to his lawyers. The FBI determined several weeks later that the memo contained information that was “confidential.”\n\nMoreover, Horowitz also found that Comey had shared another memo containing “For Official Use Only” information to one of his lawyers and had instructed that lawyer to share that information with a reporter.\n\nHorowitz then criticized Comey for failing “to live up to his responsibility” by disclosing government documents in violation of FBI policy.\n\nRosenstein took to Twitter to respond to the findings of Horowitz’s report and seemingly take aim at Comey, without mentioning him, by posting a quote from a letter he penned in June 2018 that cautioned against violating DOJ policy to achieve short-term results.\n\n“It is important for the Department of Justice to follow established policies and procedures, especially when the stakes are high,” Rosenstein wrote in his letter, which was quoted in part in his post on Aug. 29.\n>“It is important .. to follow established policies and procedures, especially when the stakes are high…. We should be most on guard when we believe that our own uncomfortable .. circumstances justify ignoring .. principles respected by our predecessors.” https://t.co/rJNZ0Hr20k\n    - Rod Rosenstein (@RodRosenstein) August 29, 2019\n\n“It may seem tempting to depart from Department policies and traditions in an effort to deflect short-term criticism, but such deviations ultimately may cause a loss of public confidence in the even-handed administration of justice,” his letter continued, adding that “we should be most on guard when we believe that our own uncomfortable present circumstances justify ignoring timeless principles respected by our predecessors.”\n\nThe quotes follow a paragraph in his letter that stated Comey felt “unique” and “unusual” circumstances justified his actions in leaking information to the public and Congress about the Hilary Clinton email investigation, and about the probe into Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRosenstein’s Twitter post came after Comey responded to the IG report on Twitter, underscoring the fact Horowitz did not find evidence he had leaked classified information to the media. However, he did not address the fact that he instructed his lawyer to pass sensitive information made in the course of his work in the FBI to the media.\n<back & forth between Rosenstein & reporter defending Comey ensues, culminating in:\nRosenstein replied: “Another pundit illustrates my point: In 2016, he agreed policy violations ‘should trouble anyone who believes in the rule of law and fundamental principles of fairness.’ Many employees dislike supervisors, but most keep faith with government institutions.” He also shared in his post Miller’s own 2016 Washington Post op-ed, “James Comey’s abuse of power.”",

And Michael Horowitz has concluded that all four FISA warrants were illegal,\" he told WMAL on Monday.\nThe announcement comes days after The Hill's John Solomon reported Horowitz had completed his investigation and, after a declassification period, could be released sometime between mid-September to early October.\n\nDiGenova previously said memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.\n<snip>\nDiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days. He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been \"framed\" by the Justice Department and the FBI, and has spread conspiracy theories about it.\nBut diGenova appears to have some knowledgeable sources.\n\nIn April he said a \"bombshell\" report on Comey was imminent that included criminal referrals. Although diGenova's expectation for the report's release in two weeks was off the mark, Comey was criminally referred for his memos memorializing his conversations with Trump. The Justice Department declined to prosecute. In a piece published Wednesday, the Washington Examiner's Byron York confirmed with sources that Horowitz is preparing to release a report on Comey's conduct in the Trump-Russia investigation, separate from the report on alleged FISA abuses.",

He is uncontactable.\"\n\nSo - social media scrubbed, makes him \"uncontactable'?? I don't think so.\nThe 'house in Paris' makes this an international child sex trafficking ring.\nThe \"modeling agency\" based out of TEL AVIV and NYC is extremely unsettling for (((certain people)))\nBrunel & Maxwell are therefore most likely in Israel, and as many speculate that Epstein is still alive, he would be there as well.

There’s also some evidence that Scotti has supervised or at least been aware of Mifsud’s establishing contacts in Russia.\nMeanwhile, media scrutinized Roh’s background, finding that he ran several businesses, including an energy consultancy and a law firm, and has offices in Switzerland, Germany, London, Hong Kong, mainland China, Russia, Monaco, and the United Arab Emirates.\nOf particular interest to many media were any contacts Roh may have had with Russia.\nRoh has been open about his sympathies for Russia.\nHis wife is a Russian fashion designer and he’s been pursuing business in Russia too. He’s rejected, however, speculation about a more extensive Russian involvement in his business ventures.\n<snip>\nRoh’s name has recently popped up in the media after U.S. Attorney John Durham reportedly requested a recorded deposition that Mifsud entered with Roh in May 2018. Roh said he provided the deposition to Durham’s team as well as some Congress members.\nAttorney General William Barr told Congress in April about his intent to review “both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016.” Durham’s investigation is most likely a part of that effort.",

And the Nunes lawsuit alleged the watchdog group and the opposition research firm then colluded to target him and stymie his efforts, pointing to three ethics complaints filed by the Campaign for Accountability allegedly “in concert with” Fusion GPS in an effort to “chill reporting of Fusion GPS and Simpson’s wrongdoing” and to dissuade Nunes from making criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\nNunes described Fusion GPS as “a political war room for hire that specializes in dirty tricks and smears” and the Campaign for Accountability as a “dark money, partisan, left-wing” nonprofit that he said targets mainly conservatives.\nDaniel Stevens, the executive director for the Campaign for Accountability, told the Washington Examiner, “We look forward to vigorously defending ourselves against this obviously frivolous and baseless lawsuit.” Stevens told the Daily Caller in August that his organization “did not hire Fusion to look into Devin Nunes or coordinate with the firm regarding our ethics complaints against Devin Nunes.”",

The panel last month subpoenaed the American living in the Philippines to answer its questions about whether the website “amplifies extremist views, leading to the radicalization of its users.”\nWatkins “provided vast and helpful information to the Committee about the structure, operation, and policies of 8Chan and his other companies. We look forward to his continued cooperation with the Committee as he indicated his desire to do so during today’s deposition,” they said in a joint statement.\n“__If__ 8chan comes back online, it will be done __when__ 8chan develops additional tools to counter illegal content under United States law,” Watkins said in the statement released by his lawyer.\n“__If__ 8chan returns, staff would implement a way to restrict certain parts of the website during a state of emergency, in which case ''any board in question would be put in a read-only mode until it would be deemed safe enough to enable posting again'',” it said.\nCritics last month pressed tech companies to shun 8chan, which in its Twitter profile describes its location as “The Darkest Reaches of the Internet” and has become a hotbed for white extremist content.\nThompson and Rogers said last month the shooting deaths of 22 people at an El Paso Walmart store was “at least the third act of supremacist violence linked to your website this year.”\nThe El Paso gunman allegedly posted a four-page statement on 8chan before his attack, while the site was also apparently used this year by the shooters who attacked two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand and a synagogue in Poway, California, lawmakers told Watkins in a letter last month.\nBenjamin Barr, a lawyer for Watkins, said in a statement to the committee, that “8chan has never tolerated '''illegal speech''' and has a consistent track record of working with law enforcement agencies when appropriate.”\nWatkins said 8chan “has worked responsibly with law enforcement agencies when '''unprotected speech''' is discovered on its platform. No single platform can sensibly prevent all hateful, illegal, or threatening speech - it can only act in due time to remove it.”\nThe company did remove some posts soon after mass shootings in Texas, California and New Zealand, he said.\nBut Watkins added, “'''my company has no intention of deleting constitutionally protected hate speech'''. I feel the remedy for this type of speech is counter speech, and __I’m certain that this is the view of the American justice system.__”\nThe message board has been voluntarily down since late August. \n>SCOTUS ruled that so-called \"hate speech\" doesn't exist in law, even speech someone else \"hates\" is covered under 1A\nI think Jim's message is clear: CodeMonkey is working on a way to put the board in read-only mode when someone posts nonsense agent provocateur bullshit, but deal with it immediately and resume normal operations for everyone else.\nSo the gambit will have failed utterly - Q is still working in background, anons are not all congregated in one place, but sprouted up all over the place. Like the mist, anons are able to coalesce, disperse and regroup anywhere anytime.\n==NOTHING CAN STOP WHAT'S COMING==",

If it can be worked so Q can have a tripcode then, I don't see how this is not a better option than either 8ch-reboot or endchan. JMO\nAnd I also agree on the abuse of \"emergency powers\" - all through human history. But from what I gathered (parsing Jim's words) - __IF__ someone were to post a \"manifesto\" and it's reported, the \"staff\" would 1) note the report, 2) put single board in read-only mode, 3) quarantine/delete the specific post, 4) restore posting mode for that board. I could be wrong, and I've never seen this personally (thank goodness) but that seems like what already happens when something illegal is posted and someone reports it to mod/jannie, except for the read-only/restore posting part. Jim has been very adamant that all legal speech will not be policed, and tbqh we ALL don't want illegal shit on the board/s (any of them) - we have no interest in it and it puts us in danger. I have been on 8ch when it was suddenly taken offline for an hour or so, turns out it was shut off so the db could be stopped (no writing to it) to be backed up for LE. Jim/CM already always cooperate with LE where cases of illegality occurs and they receive a request. So it seems to me that that's what CodeMonkey would be working on in the interim period: a way to put just that specific board in read-only mode, quarantine/delete post, restore board in a very quick manner.\n\nI don't know if you were on 8ch right before it was shut down but some faggot who obsessively stalks some celeb-dude and obsessively hates on some other female celeb he think the object of his desire wants/is involved with was posting his own DL, SS card, receipts and all sorts of shit intentionally self-doxing.... reported & banned each time. Apparently, he's done that on other boards as well, but having never seen that personally, it was a bit alarming. Anyway, jannies took care of it almost immediately after being reported, without the board being taken offline or put in read-only mode. While this is obviously (the old way) just fine, consider Jim's position - full mockingbird character-assassination, being called to be grilled before Congress. He has to give them something, and it seems to me that it is a token effort, but he will still be dedicated to free speech.\n\nTime will tell I guess.\nI'm curious what CM meant by Project Odin (I doubt they will launch their own DNS satellite)...",

Even though, as you pointed out, that content on /patriotsfight/ was deleted prior to 8ch being taken offline. While it may not have been planned that 8ch be taken offline at that time, it was always a distinct possibility, since all other methods of disruption had not worked to that point. Realistically, Q team would have planned for that, I know I thought about it pretty early on, and they are surely several standard deviations above my IQ. \nYes, it does depend on the interpretations, but I don't think that things are slowing down at all - on the contrary, they are progressively ramping up, a cumulative effect, just like an avalanche: Public doesn't believe Epstein \"suicide\" for one minute, false-flag/mass shootings not working, no one listening to the mockingbirds...\nI think this is the reason for the  tech giants' \"social credit\" bullshit (a la China) - they have lost control and they know it, and they know we know it.\n\n> Q has said \"The choice to know will be yours\" - and this has always bothered me with regard to things.\nI would submit that it is supposed to bother you. There are many things that most cannot handle, and thus are not equipped \"to know\", others don't want to know, others do want to know but won't handle it well, others will face whatever it is stoically. Past a certain point for the public, it is voluntary (besides what's published/publicly acknowledged, more info will be available to those that seek it out), thus the choice to know.\n\n >\"The great awakening is dead.\"\nIf you zoom out, it's pretty clear that the Great Awakening is just getting started, my friend. It is not dependent on mockingbirds any longer. '''That we are here on zeronet is a pointed testament to their total loss of control.''' I do believe that Jim will bring 8ch back and it, too will be a testament to the indefatigability of the chans and anons, and also of the Great Awakening. There is no putting the toothpaste back in the tube.\n\nWe will most likely not see some mass roundup of all those we love to hate but some definitely will face justice publicly, others will face consequences out of the public eye. If you think about it, it must be that way, just like there cannot realistically be 100% disclosure, no matter what WE would like/could handle, decisions are made based on the gamut of the populace and geopolitical concerns. In truth, when leaders have to make tough decisions, and they decide well, everyone is a little unhappy with the outcome but everyone gets something. POTUS is a good negotiator, a true Patriot and like us, hates those scumbags/cabal/minions and wants justice for America (first).\n\n>>8e4ec727-b156-435a-b96b-d6d1d69bf2f2\n>lapel pin\nYeah, saw that, I think it's a big FU to (((them))). I think a lot of people, having been burned by paytriots before, didn't have a lot of confidence in Jim. I never knew anything about him before this (or CM) however he seems like a truly stand up, honorable guy, and I'm glad I have stuck up for him throughout this. Even if they do their best and it doesn't work out, he and Ron will have tried and worked valiantly for actual Free Speech, and they deserve some due credit. Honor and courage have been unfortunately lacking in our country, so it's good to see it.\n\n>8ch in space?\nShitposting from space station, moon base, Mars - 8's got be accessible!\n\nWe need a CodeMonkey SpaceDNS meme...\n\n>new puppy, best feels\nthe best!\n**besides new baby**",

Part of that domination strategy is to occupy both poles and the middle, so they remain gatekeepers for all different main groups, political and social.\n\n>Leading voice of MAGA\nLike Milo appointed himself as the figurehead of the \"alt-right\"... no one asked him to, no one was looking to him for anything yet he was able to proclaim himself and be the media darling, by his fellows (the people of Shapiro, Posobiec, Blitzer, Horowitz, Levin, Savage, Rubin, etc.)\nDo you see the pattern?\n\n>Comment sections where the interview is posted are interesting, no one is buying his shit.\nThat is really one of the things that is really making them panic the most. A few prosecutions, limited hangout style, won't decapitate them. But the greater public not even buying what their paytriot darlings are selling is far worse for them. They are losing gatekeeper status faster and faster. Remember the weird little blip in the news that facebook is going to offer mockingbird outlets syndication on their platform (makes zuckerberg $, tightens up what \"news\" is seen in curation to the masses on facebook)? It also has the effect of forcing more eyes on those failing outlets' products (like the captive audience at an airport or medical office). This would not be proposed if the situation were not dire for them.\n\nI think D5 relates to the Great Awakening, too, not just swamp draining clean-up (prosecutions). And I know many anons are discouraged through this period of 8ch being down, but I am not, nor am I concerned at all. It's still not a LARP, Patriots are clearly in control, we can see the growing panic (and subsequent lashing out) as well as '''look at the game itself and study the players''' - apply what we know and see that the Plan is moving along quite nicely.\n\n>This is not a game. Learn to play the game with us. -Q\nGoing weeks without contact, not knowing what the left or right hand are doing, no instructions or any contact at all... must be what it is like to be a sleeper agent.",

I do agree with R Hoagland that there has been a secret space program for quite a while (Rumsfeld's famous 9/10/01 speech & the missing trillion$$$) and keeping in mind that these types of things are already a done deal by the time they are announced publicly, I really can't rule it out. Dr. Farrell had mentioned in an interview a few years ago that there were actual serious tests on internet connectivity/speed between the Earth and our moon, announced publicly but with no fanfare and very little notice... much like the mention of the use of an ion propulsion drive by NASA on some mission involving an asteroid (30 year old tech, why are we still using chemical rockets?!? even ion propulsion has to be outdated by now).\n\nMany threads to pull on. I do think our MIL tweets are sometimes so incredibly pointed, and others I am not sure how they relate or even if they do. But more eyes on, the better. POTUS is laying groundwork for some major transformational changes, like first making us oil/gas independent so we can start the transition over to (hopefully) more Tesla-like power, and that will \"fuel\" our economy greatly, if you think about what would actually be necessary to do that - adapters for electronics, different types of batteries, home heat-pumps that would be more efficient, overhauling our power plants - so many manufacturing/installation jobs (not the majority for robotics, but humans) etc. Trump thinks BIG, **and that's only one reason we love him.** So yeah, I can see that as a part of Space Force, because a Great Awakening is necessary on so many levels and different business sectors are going to change drastically, we are looking up instead of down and around. CM is thinking big & looking up, too! Who really knows what help they are getting, whether advice, tech input or hardware (or any combination thereof)??\n\nYou wouldn't care about internet speed on the moon unless...\n\nOn the space front, India's moon launch failed and they are devastated about it.",

Even the most exceptionally large bribes do not reach into 1 billion - there are too many ways to track it and attract notice. That money must have been used elsewhere.

I am hearing that the Justice Department is nearing a decision to release 10 or 12 of the most important documents before the ...

Graham also seeks FISA filings related to Page and any other Trump associates, FBI or DOJ documents related to Steele and opposition research firm Fusion GPS, and records related to defensive briefings given to the Clinton and Trump campaigns by intelligence officials in 2016.",

While I did not see a working SH box on my visit, NRGLab has convinced me that it has indeed created a working room-temperature thermoelectric generator.\"\n\nThe link in the article goes here:\nhttp://www.nrglab.asia/\nhttps://archive.is/aXr5z\n\nThe company website touts it's \"ion\" skincare products.

She has a son of her own involved in oil importing from Ukraine. He even used his Mom to promote his business.\nWhen Pelosi, Jr., was asked about the purpose of his visit at the time, this is how he responded:\nPelosi, executive director of the Corporate Governance Initiative, was asked why he was in Kiev.\n“Today we’re here to talk about soccer,” Pelosi said.\n“We recently got an endorsement from the world sports alliance and we’ve spoken with the Ukraine government about collaboration for soccer for young people,” he said.\n“Ukraine has a great history in soccer and we hope to share in that tradition going forward.”\nThe House Minority Leader’s son’s work there is curious, given the Democrats’ attempts to collaborate with Ukraine to attack Donald Trump.\nRep. Adam Schiff is one of Donald Trump’s fiercest, most relentless critics. He still insists there was collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign and is a primary mover behind the current efforts to impeach the president.\nBut Schiff has his own connections to Ukraine that may raise troubling questions about a conflict of interest.\nSchiff’s ties to a wealthy Russian-American businessman doing business in Ukraine have recently come to light. Igor Pasternak is CEO of Worldwide Aeros Corp., a company that makes blimps for the military and commercial sectors. The company also makes a modified version of the M4 and M16 rifles that are manufactured in Ukraine. His connection to Pasternak, who is doing business with the Ukrainian government, could be construed as being a conflict of interest in his committee’s investigation.\nFox News:\nIn 2013, Pasternak hosted a fundraiser in Washington for Schiff, who later came to embrace a strong stance in support of the United States sending military aid to Ukraine during its conflict with Russia.\n“Before this time, Schiff rarely, if ever, mentioned Ukraine,” Fox News’ Laura Ingraham said on her show Thursday night, after detailing Schiff’s connection to Pasternak. “But after the fundraiser, he used multiple television appearances to basically demand that we send money and arms to them.”\n\nSaagar Enjeti\n✔\n@esaagar\n\n\nBiden in this clip says it is not a conflict of interest that he was point person on Ukraine policy while his son was sitting on a Ukrainian energy company board.\nWhen pressed on the appearance of it, he tells the reporter to instead \"focus on this man\" AKA Trump\nWATCH: Joe Biden explodes when a reporter asks a very simple question:\n\"How was your role as Vice President in charge of policy in Ukraine and your son's job in Ukraine, how is that not a conflict of interest?\"\nBiden: \"I'm not going to respond to that!\"\nWhat is he hiding?",

			"body": "Breaking: Nancy Pelosi's son and his partners involved with organization who wikileaks claims is a front organization. Pelosi & partners running fake businesses.\n\nYou may have seen the video that surfaced recently of Paul Pelosi speaking about how his company, The Corporate Governance Initiative, was in the Ukraine to discuss \"Soccer\".\n\nhttps://twitter.com/American_Mirror/status/1177576868733698048?s=20\n\nIn the video he says, \"Today we are here to talk about Soccer. We recently got an endorsement from the World Sports Alliance (WSA) and we've spoken to the Ukraine government about collaboration for soccer for young people.\" Per Wikileaks about WSA,\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Tp7kNHZ.jpgJPG\n\nWikileaks claims the WSA is a deceitful front company. So i looked into them and their partners and I came accross what seems to be a large number of businesses that are providing fake products or services and who involve Paul Pelosi and his business partners.\n\nHere are the people that run the WSA:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9F0JG8E.jpgJPG\n\nNotice the Global Communications Director, R. Rashaad LV Patrick. Rashaad is also the President of Paul Pelosi's Corporate Governance Initiative, who was recently doing business in Ukraine. Here are the people who run CGI: http://www.corpgovinit.com/\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tMydufp.jpgJPG\n\nTake a look at the sponsors from CGI.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/w8r3a21.jpgJPG\n\nYou'll notice one of Rashaad and Pelosi's partner of CGI is Street Jammz. Look at their team:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6EwYlk3.jpgJPG\n\nRashaad Patrick, the Global Communications officer of the WSA and the President of CGI, is again president of a company called Street Jammz, that supposedly sells adult onesies. The problem is their product seems to be fake. I searched the website and there are what look to be products but the links redirect you to the home page and there is nothing on google or anywhere else that sells or even mentions this product. Their twitter page is active, but is obviously fake with zero info on their products and daily posts about the weather. Very odd. https://twitter.com/streetjammz?lang=en\n\nDid you notice the Vice President of Street Jammz, Aric Reutlinger, was also listed above as the Communications Director for CGI.\n\nHere is another company to look into. Renae Star Products.\nhttp://www.renaestar.com/\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KWzjR3f.jpgJPG\n\nhttp://www.renaestar.com/\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KWzjR3f.jpgJPG\n\nRashaad Patrick is listed as a Market Analyst for this organization and Aric Reutlinger is listed as a Network Specialist. The first picture is of Renae Star who is listed as the Executive Director. Browsing through the website, when you click on the products, it also redirects you back to the homepage just as it did with the products of Street Jammz. I have yet to find anywhere that sells or even mentions this product and again, it makes one believe this is a fake site, which has a similar layout to all other sites these guys are involved in. Lets look at Renae Stars partners.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/I7a6eco.jpgJPG\n\nOnce again, we see Pelosi and Rashaads CGI. Why is Pelosi partnering with companies selling fake products? Lets look more closely at Renae Star.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/renae.star/\nhttps://i.imgur.com/19YSXDx.jpgJPG\n\nAs you can see, she looks more like an escort or stripper, rather than an entrepeneur or a business partner to Rashaad Patrick and Paul Pelosi.\n\nThe head pic from her website is also on her instagram, just so we are certain it is the same person.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BrYblE5gfii/\n\nAlso interesting is that the World Sports Alliance has a subsidiary called the World Sports Alliance TV. Check out who runs that organization.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PHt9Gz0.jpgJPG\n\nRashaad Patrick President yet again of another company, along with his buddie Aric Reutlinger who is General Manager. Asa St Clair is President of the WSA, there is virtually zero information on a Bob Frifington and look who we see there too...Renee Star, although spelled differently.\n\nOnce again, a very questionable site. https://wsatv.info/\n\nLets look back at Renee Stars partners:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/I7a6eco.jpgJPG\n\nThere is a company called Paladin. Here is the Paladin Team:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iAMV8j9.jpgJPG\n\nYet again, Rashaad is President and Aric is VP. Here is their site: http://www.paladinwatches.com/\n\nJust like the fake onesies from Street Jammz and the fake products from Renae Star, this company sells fake watches. When you click on their products, you get a 404 error. Rashaad Patrick also photoshopped his companies logo on stars like Kanye West and Jason Statham.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20191004190330/http://paladinwatchco.blogspot.com/2017/06/paladin-luxury-watch-company-many-types.html",

Pasternak was formally recognized with a prestigious “Certificate of Honor” on Friday, March 20 2014, which cites his significant contributions to bilateral cooperation.\n\nMr. Pasternak reacted to receipt of this honor, by stating: “I am extremely grateful for the acknowledgment, and proud to forever call myself a Ukrainian-Jewish-American. I feel blessed by the liberty and incredible opportunity America has given me these past 20 years. So, if I can play a small part in helping Americans better understand the wonderful people of Ukraine and build bridges of partnership, it is both an honor and a pleasure.”\n\nPasternak, who was raised and educated in Ukraine before immigrating to the United States, is a passionate promoter of Ukrainian culture and business. He has been active in both Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to support increased bilateral ties between the two countries and has been especially active building awareness of Ukraine’s strategic economic importance among Members of Congress. Since political protests broke out across Ukraine in late 2013, Pasternak has worked to personally inform and educate Members of Congress about the geostrategic importance of Ukraine to European and US security.\n\nIn late February 2014, during the final hours of the Yanukovych Presidency, Pasternak travelled to Kyiv for diplomatic reasons in response to the outbreak of violence that had started less than 48 hours earlier, and to support peaceful transitions amid the rapid changes now taking place across Ukraine.\n\nPasternak's company Aeroscraft Corporation (Aeros) has \"won several contracts with the Pentagon, has a long-time rivalry with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nWashington Times 2016 article:\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/10/ukraine-desperate-for-us-surveillance-equipment-in/\nhttps://archive.fo/oGxKQ\n\nIn the meantime, a private, State Department-approved transaction has a Montebello, California, company, Worldwide Aeros, set to erect eight sensor-mounted towers that would deliver immediate surveillance along the southeastern border this winter.\n\nAntiwar.com\nhttp://original.antiwar.com/justin/2017/03/21/adam-schiff-grifter-racketeer-warmonger/\nhttps://archive.fo/uczSF\n\nPasternak is selling the Ukrainians military hardware, and is doubtless eager to sell them more – paid for by US taxpayers, of course.

			"body": "Top Romney Advisor Worked With Hunter Biden On Board Of Ukranian Energy Company\n September 26, 2019 By Erielle Davidson \nhttps://thefederalist.com/2019/09/26/top-romney-adviser-worked-with-hunter-biden-on-board-of-ukrainian-energy-company/\nhttps://archive.is/yKvUA\n\nAccording to web archives, top Mitt Romney adviser Joseph Cofer Black, who publicly goes by “Cofer Black,” joined Burisma’s board of directors while Hunter Biden was also serving on the board.\nAccording to The New Yorker, Hunter joined Burisma’s board in April of 2014 and remained on it until he declined to renew his position this past May. Meanwhile, according to Burisma’s website, Black was appointed in February of 2017 and continues to serve on its board. The timelines would indicate that Black and Biden worked together at Burisma, and indeed, web archives from late 2017 show Black and Biden listed simultaneously on the board.\nBlack joined the CIA in 1974 and eventually climbed the ranks to become director of the National Counterterrorism Center from 1999 to 2002. In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed him ambassador at large and coordinator for counterterrorism. He later worked at Blackwater as a vice chairman before joining Romney’s campaign as a “special adviser” on Romney’s Foreign Policy and National Security Advisory Team in October of 2011. In 2017, Black joined the board of Burisma.\nIt’s looking increasingly probable that Burisma, the subject of a series of corruption allegations in the past, has been smartly buying Western complacency by slapping a few famous names on its board. In addition to the son of a vice president and a special adviser to a GOP presidential candidate, the board also boasts the former president of Poland from 1995 to 2005, Aleksander Kwaśniewski.\n\nWhy Romney and Brennan are so Loud\n\nRomney’s man, Joseph Cofer Black, he was the partner in crime of John Brennan, (the Deep State Master), as well as being Mitt Romney’s National Security Advisor. Bad news for Mittens.\nAnd Cofer Black is the reason Romney is desperate to have President Trump’s real investigation shut down.\n\nRead this:\nDEAD MEN DON’T NEED IMPEACHMENT. Swamp in Panic: Trump In Danger.\nBy Howell Woltz -\nOctober 3, 2019\nhttps://www.pickeringpost.com/2019/10/03/dead-men-dont-need-impeachment-swamp-in-panic-trump-in-danger/\nhttps://archive.is/m3qQd\n\n'So why did Romney want to shut down any investigation of Ukraine’s role as well?\n\nThat’s the question that got this investigation started and it’s shocking. Romney’s National Security Advisor, Joseph Cofer Black, sits on the Board of the same Burisma Holdings that was being investigated for corruption back in 2014, and the Vice President and Obama Administration demanded be shut down. Why? Because Burisma was/is their vehicle for corrupt practices in Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd CIA Director, John Brennan’s 9/11 Deep State partner, Cofer Black, is still the link to all that goes on there. In fact, I can state unequivocally that Burisma is the centre of Ukraine corruption and the Democrats’ shadow organisation for corrupt activities. I live in Eastern Europe (Poland) and my sources are first-hand.\n\nAnd I know this matters greatly to Mitt Romney as he is not yet done with politics. If Black is busted, it will reflect on Romney, and it only makes sense that Cofer Black is the Deep State ‘plant’ in case Romney ever rises above polishing knobs in the U.S. Senate.\n\nRomney wants to run for President again in 2024 and if he wins, Cofer Black will be back with his fingers on the strings either as DNI or CIA Chief of Corruption.\n\nBurisma Holdings is the hub of U.S. Democrat activities to corrupt both Ukraine and American politics and there is proof. Ukraine President Zelenskyy’s win surprised both Brennan and Black’s Deep State ops as much as Trump’s did in 2016 in America.'\n\n'So who is this Cofer Black guy?\n\nJoseph Cofer Black, joined the CIA in 1974 and rose to be Director of The National Counterterrorism Center, before joining Mitt Romney. If it were not for researching this article, I admit, he was unknown to me as well. What a revelation.\n\nBlack was also the Head of Counterintelligence who somehow missed the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, though according to The Economist, 16 foreign leaders and heads of intelligence agencies warned him it was not only going to happen but when. Oh well. And nothing was done about Cofer Black for this, indicating this is what the Deep State wanted.\n\nBut it goes deeper. John Brennan and this guy, Cofer Black, are how 19 terrorists got into the U.S.A. to attack the U.S. on 9/11. Editor Harry will jump on me or make Nurse Ratched give me a dose of Castor Oil if I say something I can’t prove, so I’m just going to quote the CIA whistleblower at the Jeddah, Saudi Arabia CIA staff hearing, who is the source:\n\n“According to Freedom Outpost, Brennan was the CIA station chief in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, when the 9/11 hijackers were given visas to travel to the United States.'",

Thank you, Senator, for putting our Nation & our Constitution above party politics & the corrupt behavior of Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe stories broke on the 26th (last month) from various outlets about Joseph Cofer Black, former spook (was appointed Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism by President George W. Bush and led the Office of Counterterrorism in the U.S. State Department until his resignation in 2004. Previously Black served in the Directorate of Operations at the Central Intelligence Agency and Director of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center), Blackwater, and a whole bunch of other global stuff.\n\nBut Coffer Black isn't just any spook, he's a highly trained, world class and knowledgeable no doubt of a great many deep state things... his wiki is eye popping\n\nThere's a gap in his \"Private Sector Work 2005-Present\" bio on wiki.... 2011 - 2016. Why? And what if anything does Brennan have or know?\n\nRomney tapped Black twice: On April 26, 2007, Black was chosen by Mitt Romney, a Republican candidate in the 2008 United States presidential election, to head his counter-terrorism policy advisory group and n October 2011, Black was chosen by Romney to serve as \"Special Adviser\" on all foreign policy issues.\n\nThen we skip to \"In January 2016 Black became an independent director of publicly traded biotechnology company Northwest Biotherapeutics (NWBO) to investigate the market manipulation of the company's stock by the hedge fund \"wolfpack\". The wolfpack and others use naked shorting of stock to drive promising young biotechs toward bankruptcy or to the point where they need to raise capital at extremely low valuations from the wolfpack themselves\".\n\nIn February 2017, Burisma Group announced the addition of Black to the company's board of directors\" where it's been recently reported he still is so far as various outlet reporting on and around 09/26/19.\n\nBUT... not so widely reported: Joseph Cofer Black, Member of the Supervisory Board, Baltic International Bank Why not? And why not this stuff either? Current positions of J. Cofer Black bio on Marketscreener\n\nFrom the link: Current positions of J. Cofer Black (Name Title Since ):\n\nNorthwest Biotherapeutics, Inc.\n\n(Biotechnology & Medical Research) Independent Director 2016\n\nRaytheon Blackbird Technologies, Inc Vice President-Global Operations 2009\n\nBaltic International Bank JSC Member-Supervisory Board 2018\n\nWHERE'S Burisma? It's not listed. Anybody else think it's weird to report on this guy but cherry pick it? I do. But guess what Cofer Black was up to for Baltic International Bank Interview with the newspaper Latvijas Avīze, Member of the Supervisory Board of Baltic International Joseph Cofer Black talks about world experience in combating money laundering\n\nIf you made it all the way through this wreck of a discussion post... and you have any comments or info on this topic, great. Maybe something, maybe nothing... not a journo or anything... just digging around. Joseph Cofer Black seems to have a treasure trove of deep state stuff from all over the world and likely connections to numerous government intel and political stuff all over the globe.",
