			"body": "Well I finally made it on here using my A20 ARM SBC. But NetBSD/evbarm only has firefox45 and 52, neither of which worked here.  45 just showed a blank page, and 52 had errors like pic and tab kept crashing.  Now I'm using seamonkey and it works but it's laggy  as fuck.  But I'm running over ssh -X, maybe it will be better  on the local X.\nAnyway I made a zeronet account and put his home directly on /var/shm, which is a RAM disk.  So nothing zeronet writes touches my HDD.\nI wonder if there's a way to turn off images from displaying automatically, since it takes  some time for them to load, and that circle animation is kind of annyoying.",

My disk is encrypted but I put zeronet files on mfs partition(memory filesystem) to avoid constantly writing to the disk.  I do the same thing with other stuff like web browser cache and other transient data.\nThe Pine64 is also a good SBC, well supported across Linux, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.  Their Rock64Pro model even has a PCIe slot for connecting SATA interface, so you can even have a RAID setup on there.  And unlike the Pi, these boards use a real power jack, so there are no problems with that at least (micro USB connectors aren't capable to supply more than 2A under the very best conditions).",

Some of the more recent ARM boards have 4GB RAM, so that's not too shabby.\nIf you wanted to be able to seed the entire 08chan, you'd probably just have to do it from HDD though.",
