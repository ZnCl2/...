Thats what we need to turn off.\nIf you turn it off then there's no possible way to display those messages.\nMy solution relies in enabling that cert, and then not downloading the messages that aren't coming from a subset of the people using that cert. The obvious problem is that contents.json might still be downloaded, making it possibility to spam content.jsons into the users folder. But I see no other way. At least they won't be able to post, and if we see the users folder growing uncontrollably because of users without data.json we can do something about it. Maybe we can blacklist content.json files somehow.\nThe second obvious problem is that \n[code]\n  \"permission_rules\": {\n   \".*@08chan\": {\n    \"max_size\": 0,\n    \"files_allowed\": \"\",\n    \"files_allowed_optional\": \"\"\n   },\n[/code]\nmight just outright ban all .*@08chan certs and make the manual \"permissions\": { ... } part useless, but if that was the case I doubt permissions would exist at all (unless they are useful to override the default permissions, but not the ones specified by regexes?).\nThe third obvious problem might be that for some reason permission_rules seem to be completely ignored by the software. Previously when you enabled self signed certs for a few minutes, we were still able to post using ZeroBit. Hopefully it is because the default permissions (which are, as almost everything in this piece of shit software, undocumented) are too lenient, and the above rulset fixes that. This problem should be mutually exclusive with the previous one, since if defaults are too lenient the \"permissions\" property wouldn't be needed to ovverride them, which would mean they were useful to override permission_rules.\n>Edit: Looks like the proper syntax is double backslashes? This is how the main line for the cert signers is structured.\nOh, yeah, right. That was an artifact from pasting the stuff in a .py file without escaping the backslashes.

I think you're onto something, with the \"permissions\" able to override the main code lines as exceptions. Its worth a shot, right?\nYeah, I don't mean in the cert_signers. I mean your code looked like\n[code]\n  \"permission_rules\": {\n   \".*@08chan\": {\n    \"files_allowed\": \"data.json\",\n    \"files_allowed_optional\": \"(src\\\\/)?.{40}(-thumb)?\\\\.(png|jpeg|jpg|gif|webm|mp4|ogg|mp3|pdf|epub)(\\\\.piecemap\\\\.msgpack)?\",\n    \"max_size\": 5000000\n   }\n  }\n[/code]\nYou'll notice it only mentions .*@08chan (self signed certs), it says nothing about .*@zeroid.bit users.

They're performed over the normalized JSON file with the node that holds the signature omitted (https://zeronet.io/docs/site_development/content_json/#signs).\nThe way I suspect self-signed certs are produced is there's a private key hard-coded into the ZeroNet client for an also hardcoded user's public key (1NwwLdiFBcVAA4jXQ712ZtQfDHEMvk8BiD) which is then referred to as the domain (08chan) and allows clients to sign .*@08chan certs.
