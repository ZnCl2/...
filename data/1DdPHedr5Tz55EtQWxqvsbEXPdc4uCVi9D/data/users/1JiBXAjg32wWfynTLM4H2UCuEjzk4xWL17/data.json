I rather not have to go back to 4chan's Japanese learning threads. Seconding >>06c75b55-e57e-4464-957a-88db3540cb5a on wanting /delicious/ back. Those request threads were hopping and I don't see any other imageboard allowing something like that. Hell, do the drawfags even know about the bunker?!",

Seems I have a lot of folders with 2 .json files, very few having thumbnails and fewer still with src subfolders with the actual pics. I get the feeling this is gonna get very unmanageable very quickly (I already have about 300MB cached) so at least this way I can delete individual folders manually (assuming it doesn't mess anything up).\n\nIn short, thank you.",
