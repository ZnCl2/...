Almost anyone can afford hundreds of gigs, so in that respect we're good for weeks, and the bandwidth for sharing a single image from one PC to another is theoretically less than a single second even for less than stellar connections.\nNo, the main problem is just that Zeronet has brain damage.\nEven when disabling Tor my  average speed is like 80KB/s for both upload and download for some reason even when though I have a connection that can sustain about 5 MB/s upload when using regular torrents.",
