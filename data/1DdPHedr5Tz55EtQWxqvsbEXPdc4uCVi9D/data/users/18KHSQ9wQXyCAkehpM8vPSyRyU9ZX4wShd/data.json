Switching every few posts only would actually work if either multiple people begin doing the same thing, or I created a few identities and used them for weeks at a time, but for that last one I would have to use normal looking usernames and assign a writing style and set of topics to talk about to each ID, and I'm too lazy to do it. Right now it would be obvious most of these posts are done by me just by the content and writing style. Even if multiple people did it, it probably would be kinda ineffective and identities could be linked between them unless a new ID was generated before every post (vs doing it every few posts). And for this to be practical the generation would have to be done in the background and the switch made fast enough that it doesn't generate too long of a delay, and that would require being able to programmatically switch IDs without having to fiddle with files and restarting ZN.\nI've thought about generating believable usernames using neural networks, but so far there's so little posting activity, that it would probably be possible to connect all IDs to the same user even if an effort is made to obfuscate it.\nAn easy way to switch between IDs would make it more doable, but then again there's so little activity that I'm not sure it's worth it.\nAt least switching between IDs means plausible deniability from the perspective of the legal system, so I guess that's still a small plus.\n>>b8229cb6-1f0c-4422-ac06-0abcb5d385b3\nEach fact about yourself carries an extra bit of identifying information (compared to how many bits your adversary has) only if it can be used to subdivide the set of people who you possibly are in half.",
