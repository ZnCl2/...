			"body": "Now that we have way fewer shills, which of the Democratic candidates for President do you think is least shitty?\n\nI'm inclined to support Tulsi Gabbard\n>The good\n- Anti-Interventionist foreign policy that opposes Jewish wars for Israel.  This is good on so many levels.  It is inherently popular with the American public, it is almost wholly within the authority of the President, it counteracts the national interests of Israel, and it saves American lives.  Because of her personal background, I'm inclined to believe that this is her sincere position and that she is not going to compromise on it lightly.\n\n- She's a target for the Jews disinfo campaigns regarding accusing everyone who acts counter to their foreign policy interests as being a Russian agent.  Unlike Trump, she inspires sympathy and appeals to people who he did not, so more people will wake up to this Russophobic lunacy and work to put more pressure against going to war vs. Russia, Syria, or Iran.\n\n>The Bad\n- Social policy (free space for Democrats)\n- She's a woman\n- She's not white\n\n>The Ugly\n- Mixed record on BDS.  She voted in favor of a non-binding resolution from Cohengress condemning the BDS movement, but also cosponsored legislation made by Ilhan Omar to assert the Constitutionality of participating in BDS.  I'm inclined to suspect that the latter could be a shrewd political move taken knowing that it probably won't get through the House and definitely will not get through the Senate (and even then President \"Free Land for Israel\" won't sign off on it).  Then again, Ziocuckery is expected for a serious presidential candidate from the two parties, so this is almost a free space.",

What are some things you're curious about involving ghosts?\n\nAs for me...\n- I find the thought of ghosts existing to be simultaneously creepy and comforting, I suppose it would depend upon the reason they're around metaphysically speaking.  If it is severe enough trauma surrounding death or something unaccomplished in life that would keep them around, I'd rather they not be.\n- I'm skeptical of the existence of ghosts\n- I claim no encounters with ghosts although my brother received mysterious unexplained scratching while we were (as a family) on a ghost tour\n- I have been on a few ghost tours at landmarks famous for supposed hauntings.  As far as I know, those have yielded no personal encounters (unsurprisingly)\n- If real, I subscribe to the whole traumatic/sudden death/unfinished business explanation, but it does raise some serious questions regarding the surprising lack of well-known hauntings at sites of mass death such as battlefields.\n- A few things I'd like to know would be how long past death can ghosts remain haunting a place and if that depends on certain factors.  I'd also like to know why ghosts have a tendency to be reported as being clothed and if ghosts can select the people they do appear before.",

As my first-favorite choice suggests, I'm a big fan of unconventional settings.  Modern day espionage is about as unconventional as it gets for a (video game) RPG.  The dialogue system is perfectly cinematic, every decision feels like it's on the fly (because it is), and most of the prompts combined with the orientation give you a really clear idea of how you're responding (I never had trouble, at least).  The script is tightly written and the subtle variations in dialogue and emails depending on the sequences you do and how it turns out make the game very replayable. I like how there isn't a karma system and instead the game tracks your relationship with the other characters.  The closest it comes to having karma is tracking the cost of the injuries you cause (if you opt for a non-lethal approach) or the number of orphans you create if you go lethal (more orphans for Al-Samad terrorists than VCI PMCs is a nice touch).  I also like how the game is played optimally by picking your responses to get characters to react how you want them to rather than just trying to please everyone.  Pissing off Marburg by being a smarmy fuck, for example, can create the situation where instead of being a consumate professional, he decides to fight you to the death early and you get to have your revenge for Madison or the tourists.  The consequences in the game make sense as does what motivates all the antagonists.\n\nThe one thing about Alpha Protocol people invariably bitch about is the gameplay, but I think their complaints are overstated.  Stealth does feel like an essential skill and without it the game is less fun, but that should be expected in a game where you play as a spy.  Stealth is doable without it, although a bit of a hassle, because you pretty much have to memorize how enemies turn when you try to sneak around them.  I enjoy the differences in how focusing with different firearms works, crits with a pistol feel satisfying as does picking off an enemy precisely at range with an assault rifle.  The shotguns and the submachineguns are a bit less fun, but they do feel like distinct weapons that would have distinct uses if you invest in them. \n\ntl;dr: Alpha protocol has good roleplaying and underrated gameplay.",

Don't take my word for it and don't take the cocksucker below you's.  Socialism is a general term for a structure of economy in which the state plays a major role.  Every government in the world that isn't a Nigger-infested shithole follows to some extent or another.  There is no truly capitalistic country nor was there ever, even as conceived by Smith.  To say Socialism is bad would be a gross simplification of the matter but whether or not socialistic elements make a society better or worse can be debated.\n\n>What makes National Socialism better than the socialism that the right doesn't like?\nNational socialism is oriented around a very specific understanding of the nation to which it serves.  Whereas modern social democracies are invariably race-blind (or outright anti-native), national socialism in theory prioritizes the well-being of the citizens of the ethnic, cultural, and linguistic nation over those of alien groups that may inhabit the land.  Furthermore national socialism demands service from the nation that it serves, if you get anything from the national government you must also contribute to its efforts.  This ensures that things that belong to the people of the nation are the fruits of their labors and makes them better stewards of the resources.  Which is in stark contrast to the impersonal relationship created by modern socialist states, in which the primary interactions with the government are abstract, usually just paying large amounts of taxes to some bureaucrats in exchange for having some stranger provide some service that you usually do not see.",

Further, I'd question if anything of real, serious cultural value came of Tolkein's influence.  It spawned a number of imitators that lost almost as much substance from Tolkein as Tolkein did from Wagner.  It created a genre of commodified pop-cultural trash stemming from what was a great national mythic cycle.  Further, it's not like Wagner was forgotten by popular culture at large in Tolkein's time, 13 years before the publication of The Hobbit, part of Wagner's cycle was adapted to film by one of the best directors of the Weimar Republic (Fritz Lang) in a two-part epic.",

Willkie was notable because he was the '''only''' Republican candidate in 1940 that was in favor of American military intervention in Europe.  What occurred at the convention was the discovery of bombs in the Hall, but this was only publicized in relation to a separate bombing at the New York World's Fair.  As it turns out a British agent by the name of William Stephenson (one of the inspirations for James Bond) was the perpetrator at the New York World's Fair bombing, so it's likely that the same man, or one working for a related cause committed the 1940 RNC Bombing that stole the nomination for Willkie.  It's worth noting that Stephenson was a go-between for FDR and Winston Churchill as they shared state secrets, so I would not be surprised if he was taking direct orders from Churchill and Roosevelt themselves to assure the 1940 RNC nomination went to Willkie.  \nFDR had some very complimentary things to say about Willkie, he was glad that Willkie pursued the losing strategy of running against FDR not on any real issue (like his unpopular New Deal program) and instead running on the sanctity of the tradition of no president serving three+ terms.  FDR was especially grateful that Willkie did not leave it up to the voting public whether or not we would be entering World War II as it was an intensely unpopular war prior to December 7, 1941.  Had Willkie been literally anyone else, FDR would have been crushed in the 1940 election and America could have changed its footing to not embroil itself in war.  Unfortunately FDR and Churchill's terroristic conspiracy against the American public prevailed and World War II ended in the wrong side winning as a result.",
