Brain damage may result from skull fractures. The disorder can be fatal. The disease is grouped by type:\n\n    Brittle bone disease type 1 (most common & mild form): Mild – Compatible with normal life expectancy. Fractures occur throughout life, but deformity is uncommon. Features include blue sclerae, hypermobile joints, hearing loss and scoliosis.\n    Brittle bone disease type 2 (most severe form): Lethal – Most, but not all, die in early childhood. Severe deformity is common, and infants generally do not survive long after birth.\n    Brittle bone disease type 3 (severe form): Progressive deforming – Decreased life expectancy. It is characterized by bones that fracture easily and also bend. By the age of 6 years, the child has usually had multiple fractures and developed severe deformities. Children surviving till adulthood usually have short stature and disability.\n    Brittle bone disease type 4: Moderately severe – Compatible with normal life expectancy. In terms of severity lies somewhere in between types 1 and 3. Fractures are common before puberty. Sclerae are pale blue and become normal in color in adult life.\n\nfortunately, cuckwheels does have the type that will reduce his lifespan in general.

Also, they aint judges, they cant give a jail sentence or fine.\n\nLook in wikipedia the number of congressmen that have been found 'in contempt'. Zero happened to all of them.\n\nContempt of Congress is the act of obstructing the work of the United States Congress or one of its committees. Historically, the bribery of a U.S. Senator or U.S. Representative was considered contempt of Congress. In modern times, contempt of Congress has generally applied to the refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by a Congressional committee or subcommittee—usually seeking to compel either testimony or the production of requested documents.

Mich. 4/8/15)). The defendant has been described by the government as “a hard core anti-government zealot” (Government’s Response to Defendant’s Sentencing Memorandum, p. 1 (4/1/15)), and she is the wife of Peter Hendrickson, who wrote a book, Cracking the Code: The Fascinating Truth About Taxation in America (Hendrickson 2003), which the Tax Court has described as “an antitax screed” (Waltner, T.C. Memo. 2014-35 at *42).\n\nDoreen Hendrickson was found guilty of one count of criminal contempt under 18 U.S.C. Section 401(3) in a jury trial in July 2014. The indictment for criminal contempt stemmed from her “filing a U.S. income tax return for single and joint filers with no dependents (Form 1040-EZ) which falsely reported that she carried zero wages in 2008 and failing to file with the IRS amended U.S. individual tax returns for 2002 and 2003.” The defendant argued that the indictment did not allege any tax crimes.\n\nThe defendant and her husband filed tax returns for 2002 and 2003 that claimed refunds for all taxes withheld from their wages, based on the theory that their income was not taxable (a theory propounded in Peter Hendrickson’s book). In a 2007 civil judgment, the Hendricksons were ordered to file amended returns for 2002 and 2003, and they were prohibited from filing any tax returns that used the “false and frivolous” arguments found in Cracking the Code (Hendrickson, No. 2:06-cv-11753 (E.D. Mich. 5/2/07)).\n\nAfter the issuance of that order, Doreen Hendrickson filed a 2008 tax return that claimed a refund on the theory that her wages were not taxable income (she filed this tax return even though her income for the year was below the threshold requiring a return to be filed). The couple also filed amended returns for 2002 and 2003, but they wrote “under duress” over their signatures and attached a statement asserting that nothing in the returns should be taken as an admission that they had income in 2002 or 2003. The IRS argued that these were not valid returns because the Hendricksons had altered the part of the tax return in which the taxpayers declare their returns are made under penalties of perjury by adding the words “under duress.”\n\nAfter Peter Hendrickson was sentenced to prison in a separate trial for filing false returns, Doreen Hendrickson filed a second set of amended returns to which she attached an affidavit disclaiming those amended returns and reasserting that the original returns were correct.\n\nThe defendant argued that, at most, she should be sentenced to seven months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines. The government asked for a sentence of 24 months plus one year of supervised release.\n\n(lol she got over 3x the federal guideline sentencing! DON'T FUCK WITH THE IRS)\n\nThe NSA is a fuckload of pussies compared to the IRS. The IRS can seize all of your shit, even the clothes on your back, with NO warrant, no judicial oversite, and no court order. The NSA can only kill you once. The IRS can stop you from earning income worldwide, and literally strip you naked and thrown into the street. You would pray for death. Every time you want to put a slice of bread into your mouth, you would have to file with a federal judge and wait 2 weeks for his ruling.\n\nThey can keep your shit for eternity with only the justification 'under investigation'. All your 'rights' are invalid when facing them. All politicians and agencies tremble at the mere sight of one of those bean-counters.",
