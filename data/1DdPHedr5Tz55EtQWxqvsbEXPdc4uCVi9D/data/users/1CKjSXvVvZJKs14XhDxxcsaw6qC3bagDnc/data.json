To make a new ID, I had to fire up tor on a windows VM (doesnt like zeronet on my linux) and go to ZeroID there, because there's only 1 ID for one's IP, and I couldn't change mine normally. Then I got the ENTIRE windows data folder (including users.json shit), and copied it back into my linux, after deleting ALL of my original linux data folder with no ZeroID tied to it.\nDespite doing this, it didn't work.\nWhat's most important is, I was signed in as the right user, but the ZeroID was nowhere to be found. Maybe it's because I crossed OSes, as copying the ENTIRE windows ZeroNet ID-tied install, and fucking running it in wine worked. 'tis what I'm doing to post right now.",
