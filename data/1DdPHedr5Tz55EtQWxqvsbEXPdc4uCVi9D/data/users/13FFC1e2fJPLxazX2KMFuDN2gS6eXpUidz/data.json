The vpn will act like an ISP which defeats the purpose of the VPN. \n\nThe ONLY reason to use a VPN and TOR would be if you want to connect to something that doesn't allow tor exit nodes to connect.  Then you would use TOR to connect to the VPN and the VPN to connect to the site.   You would need to use anonymous means and tor to sign up for the VPN or it would compromise you.\n\nSo maybe you buy a giftcard with cash, or run you own bitcoin node over tor and pay fo the vpn using that.  \n\n(I hope you bought your bitcoin with cash at a bitcoin ATM )\n\nBut I am thinking this is quickly going to become moot.   Why connect to shit that doesn't allow tor?  Just hang out where you can use tor/i2p/etc.  Let the corporate net die on the vine.",

Someone probably skimmed other manifestos for points they wanted to smear then posted it to get 8ch shutdown.  \n\nThis place is better than other chans though because you can post images over tor ( set yourself up a firewalled user that can only communicate over tor and use regular browser till torbrowser image posting is fixed).

Anon is barred from accessing the net except via tor by firewall.  All attempts to access regular net are redirected through tor via trans-proxy.\n\nThis is in effect for both anon ( where I am logged in ) and for zeronet process running under the zeronet user.\n\n\nThis means that even if my browser were hacked it would be running as anon which cannot access the net except by tor.\n\n\nVery convenient. ( but if they  were to hack to the point where they could run a process not using anon user or zeronet user I'd still be hosed.  Not perfect but good enough if you're not doing anything illegal )  \n\nNext level up in security would be to build this:\n \nhttps://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation\n\n( or just have a very beefy machine and run whonix / qubes )\n\nI have a shitty old machine so I'm going for raspberrry pi physical isolation as my next spare time project.\n\nThe nice thing about the firewall tor config and the physical isolation config is that you don't need to configure zeronet at all.  It tries to connect normally, but it gets automatically redirected to tor by the firewall.\n\nBut you can then afterwards configure zeronet for tor in case there are performance enhancements tailored to tor.  (but even if you screw up zeronet config for tor, your firewall or physical isolation still saves your ass )\n\nAlso links off from zeronet sites are redirected to tor by firewall if browsing with anon user, so  THEY can't compromize you.\n\nCan use dissenter, or even twitter too.\n\nAnd you can run tor-browser under this setup for higher security needs.  This setup is the base setup that by default torrifies everything.  Having tor be the default trains you to use tor friendly sites, and protects you from casual logging - remember, logs are forever.  If Joseph Stalin gets into power he'll comb through all the logs that were kept from the days when that shit was legal.  A total asshole can make things retroactively illegal.",
