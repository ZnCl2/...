The boards I pin keep getting unpinned, sometimes from just opening one thread, and there still remains some images with [Seed] next to them. After hitting [Seed] it'll tell me \"0/100% 0 Seeds\", but clicking on it eventually loads the full image. Does pinning actually work? Because it seems to miss a bunch of images since [Seed] with \"0 Seeds\" still remains, but do eventually load if I expand the image.\n\nAm I actually seeding the whole board? Goddamn why is this shit so annoying?\n\nAlso I'm not getting a bunch of notifications when I enter a thread of a board I pinned.",
