This means unless there is some way for the captcha to be served and verified by code that is running in OTHER users browsers, it would be trivial to bypass.",

			"body": "Between Ion Fury, Dusk and Amid Evil (and a lesser extent Doom 2016) it seems like there is a renascence in boomer shooters, which is exactly what I (and I think many others of a certain age) need in these insane times. Nice comfy games that are too niche and simplistic to be touched by woke clown-world bullshit. Games to remind us of better times when you could just ENJOY THINGS without apology. But no, no that would mean that a bunch of white men might be happy for a few hours and for a single solitary moment in time someone might experience new media that isn't trying to convince them that pedophilia is normal, or chopping off your dick is a good idea, or that all white men are evil Nazis.\n\nGod fucking damn it you tranny bastards I JUST WANT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES!\n\nI know it's just a soap bottle (for now. i have no confidence that more demands won't come latter), but it's set off a chain of events that I'm sure will spook void point out of making any new games like this. This was their first game, they were just a bunch of duke3d modders who got the support of 3dRealms. Worse, this shit storm might discourage other independent devs and smaller studios from making any new retro shooters.\n\nAll over a dev's personal opinion and a fucking SOAP PUN.",
