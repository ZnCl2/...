Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter in 2016 for directing racist abuse at the comedian Leslie Jones, losing nearly 400,000 followers. He was banned from Facebook in May.\n\n\"I spent years growing and developing and investing in my fan base, and they just took it away in a flash,\" wrote Yiannopoulos, who's previously rubbed shoulders with neo-Nazis and white nationalists. \"It's nice to have a little private chat with my gold star homies but I can't make a career out of a handful of people like that. I can't put food on the table this way.\"\n\nhttps://kiwifarms.is/threads/milo-yiannopoulos-says-hes-broke.60794/",
