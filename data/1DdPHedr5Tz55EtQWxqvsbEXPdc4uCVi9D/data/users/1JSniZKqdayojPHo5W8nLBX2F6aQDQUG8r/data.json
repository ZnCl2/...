			"body": "merely testing how much pasta fits here haha\n07/27/1978\nWhen I was 18... 18 years old, I saw for the first time in my life... I saw an image of clarity. I saw a comic strip... a three panel comic strip that, though simple as it seemed, changed me... changed my being, changed who I am... Made me who I am...\nEnlightened me...\nThe strip, Garfield, the comic strip was new... no more than maybe a month and a half since inception, since... since coming into existence... and there it was before me in print, I saw it... a comic strip... What was it called?\nGarfield.\nThe story here is of a man, a plain man. He is Jon, but he is more than that... I will get to this later, but first let us say that he's Jon, a plain man.\nAnd then there is a cat... Garfield.\nThis is the nature of the world, here. When I see the world, the politics, the future, the... the satellites in space, and... the people who put them there...\nYou can look at everything as a man and a cat... two beings, in harmony and at war...\nSo, this strip I saw; this man, Jon, and the cat, Garfield, you see...\nYes... hmm...\nIt is about everything. This... little comic is, oh, lo and behold... not so little anymore.\nSo yes, when I was 18, I saw this comic... and it hit me all at once, its power. I clipped it, and every day, I looked at it, and I said \"Okay... let me look at this here. What is this doing to me? Why is this so powerful?\"\nJon Arbuckle, he sits here, legs crossed... comfortable in his home, and he reads his newspaper... The news of the world, perhaps... and then he extends his fingers lightly, delicately... he taps his fingers on an end table, and he feels for something...\nWhat is it? It is something he needs, but it is not there.\nAnd then he looks up, slightly cockeyed, and he thinks... His newspaper's in his lap now, and he thinks this...\nNow where could my pipe be?\nThis... I always come to this, because I was a young man... I'm older now, and I still don't have the secrets, the answers, so this question still rings true, Jon looks up and he thinks...\nNow where could my pipe be?\nAnd then it happens... You see it, you see... it's almost like divine intervention, suddenly it is there, and it overpowers you...\nA cat is smoking a pipe.\nIt is the man's pipe, it's Jon's pipe, but the cat... this cat, Garfield, is smoking the pipe... and from afar, and someplace near, but not clear... near but not clear... The man calls out... Jon calls out, he is shocked. \"Garfield!\" he shouts.\nGarfield. The cat's name.\nBut, let's take a step back... let us examine this from all sides, all perspectives... and when I first came across this comic strip, I was at my father's house... a newspaper had arrived, and I picked it up for him, and brought it inside.\nI organized its sections for him and then, yes, the comic strip section fell out from somewhere in the middle, and landed on the kitchen floor... I picked up the paper pages and saw, up somewhere near the top of this strip... just like Jon, I was wearing an aquamarine shirt.\nSo I thought, \"Ah, interesting. I'll have to see this later.\" I snipped out the little comic, and held on to it... and five days later, I reexamined it... and it gripped me, I needed to find out more about this. The information I had was minimal, but enough...\nAn orange cat named Garfield...\nOkay, that seemed to be the lynchpin of this whole operation, yes. Another clue... a signature in the bottom right corner, a man's name...\nJim Davis.\nYes, I'm on to it for sure.\nSo... one: Garfield, orange cat, and two: Jim Davis, the creator of this cat...\nAnd that curiously plain man.\nI did not know, at the time, that his name was Jon. This strip, you see, had no mention of this man's name, and I'd never seen it before.\nBut I had these clues; Jim Davis, Garfield.\nAnd then I saw more, I spotted the tiny copyright mark in the upper left corner. Copyright 1978 to... what is this? Copyright belongs to a... PAWS Incorporated...\nI use the local library and mail services to track down the information I was looking for...\nJim Davis, a cartoonist, had created a comic strip about a cat, Garfield... and a man, Jon Arbuckle. Well, from that point on, I made sure I read the Garfield comic strips, though as I read each one, as each day passed... the strips seemed to resonate with me less and less...\nI sent letters to PAWS Incorporated, long letters, pages upon pages... asking if Mister Jim Davis could somehow publish just the one comic, over and over again... \"It would be meditative,\" I wrote, \"the strength of that.\"\nCould you imagine?\nBut... no response... The strips lost their power, and eventually I stopped reading, but... I did not want my perceptions diluted, so I vowed to read the pipe strip over and over again... That is what I call it, \"The Pipe Strip.\"\nThe Pipe Strip.",
