On PC I gotta spend time organizing my shortcuts every once in a great while, or taking my chances with pirated games, search for the latest version, or update windows, fuck with DS4 controllers, manage cables if I had my monitor hooked up to another PC, configure options in your gpu's control panel for optimal performance, triple-check you got all your save files if you're installing a new operating system or new hard drive or whatever other reason (and miss a few anyway because every game puts them in a different spot), deal with shitty fucking ports that run at 900p and tie physics to framerate. Sure, they are very, very small, ultimately trivial problems, but they can somehow start to wear on you, especially at times when you feel down and have no energy.\n\nOn 3DS I can just open it and resume from wherever I left off lmao.",
