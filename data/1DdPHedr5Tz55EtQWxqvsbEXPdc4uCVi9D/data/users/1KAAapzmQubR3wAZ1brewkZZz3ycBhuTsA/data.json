Thousands of shills hired by both sides of the american election and glowniggers galore. Then Tarrant happened and normies started flooding the gates. \nI suspect many of the new users from after 2015 haven't followed since they aren't familiar with bunkers. 8chan had it's first large migration when 4chan started clamping down and moot started fucking with /pol/ and gamergate.
