Get it out of the way and you will feel better and Understand a shitload more about the world and the economy. \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/\n\nDe-spook yourself with this pivotal piece of literature so that you may understand your justifications for the desire to overthrow the ruling class as one of self interest and, as such, will be philosophically grounded on a solid foundation.\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/max-stirner-the-ego-and-his-own\n\nThird I will recommend is \"First as a tragedy then as a farce\" by Slavoj Zizek.\nThis book will help expose you to ideology; help you understand what it is and how it functions and how to combat  it. (ultimately leading to a greater more refined understanding of the truth.)\n\nhttps://selforganizedseminar.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/zizek_-tragedy_farce.pdf\n\n...and last but not least: Mutual aid a factor in evolution.\nMutual aid a factor in evolution combats the long held and misunderstood notion of social Darwinism and pushes the reader to understand evolution from a perspective of cooperation and in ways he may not have thought of before in order to expose the read to a side of evolution which often gets glossed over when discussing it.\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-mutual-aid-a-factor-of-evolution\n\nThese are my four top recommend staples for anyone curious about or getting into leftist /lit/\n\nOther recommend reads: \nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-15-17\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-anarchism-and-other-essays\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/brian-a-dominick-animal-liberation-and-social-revolution\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/subversive-energy-beyond-animal-liberation\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-the-abolition-of-work\n\nPlease feel more than welcome to share!\n\nEnjoy!",

There is only the naked motions of the capitalist mode of production through out history and no amount of terrorism is going to change that.\n\nThe only thing that can change that is a massive social upheaval of the old society and its subsequent replacement with a society that knows nothing of the relationship of the production of goods and commodities for exchange, rather, the production of such for it's immediate use\n\nWake up, neo.",
