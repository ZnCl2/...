			"body": "**Let's get back to being /v/. If you haven't already, download https://anonfile.com/Kc07Bf2bnf/update_08chan_s_Millchan_version_201908081621_zip to fix your \"processing post\" problems. Worked like a charm for me**\n\n>The official PS4 exclusives page on the Australian PlayStation site has seen a curious update. Spotted by ResetEra, Kojima’s Death Stranding appears to have been removed from the list.\n\n>According to Wayback Machine, the list included Death Stranding as recently as May 31. This sudden change may be strange, but it’s not entirely surprising. \n\n>The game’s recently revealed official cover art does not feature the ‘Only on PlayStation’ branding standard in all PS4 exclusives. In fact, since the moment Kojima Productions announced its partnership with Sony, Death Stranding has always been referred to as a “console exclusive”, which essentially means PC is fair game.\n\n>Despite this, the game was never formally announced for PC, but everyone assumed it’ll end up on PC… at some point. Landing on Sony’s PS4 exclusives page may have been an error to begin with, but the timing of this discovery could indicate that we’re getting close to an official reveal of the PC version.\n\n>Indeed, Hideo Kojima will be among Geoff Keighley’s guests for gamescom: Opening Night Live in less than one week. Could this be the day?\n\n>It seems unlikely confirmation of the PC version will come so close to launch, as console exclusive deals tend to hold off PC releases for some time. Whatever the case may be, though, plenty of PC players are likely already considering cancelling that PS4 version pre-order.\n\nhttps://archive.fo/MHzN3",

			"body": "In case you haven't been staying abreast of the news, this expansion came out for Vermintide 2. Because it's my guilty pleasure, I ended up buying it (but only after the data mining shenanigans were resolved).\n\nHas anybody here gotten a chance to play it yet? It's quite intense but I do have some gripes. With their latest \"2.0\" update, they truly did change a lot and not all for the better, mind you. Some weapons were nerfed, others buffed, enemies can sometimes feel more tanky (though in my opinion they're weaker where it counts, unless the rapier is just that strong)\n\nOverall, lots of indecisiveness, but you must admit that they added quite a bit these past few days, DLC or no. All Fatshark really needs to do in order to gain my trust is just release all of the past DLC maps (for Vermintide 1) for free. Those ones at least had loads of content in them. The first 2 Vermintide 2 DLC were so fucking skimp it isn't even funny.",
