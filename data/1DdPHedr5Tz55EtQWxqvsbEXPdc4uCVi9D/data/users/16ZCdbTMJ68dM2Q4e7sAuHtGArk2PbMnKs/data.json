			"body": "Newbie.  First post.  I may have made a discovery, and I want to share it on the off chance none of you beautiful bastards realized this.\n\nI was reading a comment on another site a few minutes ago re: NYT, and the comment included the word \"chucklefuck.\"  Below that was an \"I accidentally typed 'cucklefuck' at first, lol.\"\n\nI formally propose that we make this typo into its own thing.  I mean, read it.  Read it aloud. \n\"Cucklefuck.\"  Doesn't that just sound like these guys?\n\nNow that I think about it, question: how do you italicize/bold/underline here?  Is it, for the italics example, <i></i>, [i][/i], **, or __?",
