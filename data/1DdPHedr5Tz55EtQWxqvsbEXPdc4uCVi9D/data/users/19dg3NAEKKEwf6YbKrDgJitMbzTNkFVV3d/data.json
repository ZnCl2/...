Are the Fighting Game Tournaments really bad now?  With the way people were describing them, they almost sound like the the AGDQ games with all the trannies and dilation all over the place.  If anyone has some hilarious and disturbing stories to share I'm all for it.  If there's nothing, then I think I will make the event about the AGDQ instead.\nUnrelated to the question I have, there's something else I have to ask:  How will Alto be handled, and how will Anon's group encounter her?  Has that been decided?  **Because I do want to see Alto mouth off to Teagan so Anon will punch Alto's lights out.**",

			"body": "I figure I'll update this thread in regards to some things I have discovered and posted on the vch board:  In regards to Miriam's ability to double and triple cast individual spells, that's not happening since I don't know how to code that and there's no actual solution online about casting a few different spells at once.  However, the Active Chain Skills plugin will get around this!\n\nFinally managed to learn how chain spells operate since yanfly didn't do a good job explaining how that shit works. However I could only see 3 skills active, I figure I can make two types for her case with the different elemental spells.\nTo make chain skills, you have to set the skill as the chain starter (CHAIN SPELL), and assign the spells to it. There is no combo skills, only chain enders, and a chain ender will have no list of chain skills in the description.\n\nChain Spell\n\n<chain skill L: 52>\n<chain skill R: 56>\n<chain skill X: 60>\n<chain skill Y: 69>\n<chain skill Z: 71>\n\nThose are Fire II, Ice II, Thunder II, Saint, and Dark. But if you leave it at that, that's only one spell you can cast out of the three. What you do next is head over to the spell that's chainable, and add it's own list in the description.\n\nFire II\n<chain skill>\n<chain skill L: 54>\n<chain skill R: 56>\n<chain skill X: 60>\n<chain skill Y: 69>\n<chain skill Z: 71>\n\nTwo things to notice: The fire II spell now has chain skill, notifying that the skill can be used for chains. If it doesn't have that label, chain spell will not work! make sure you label any skills that you want to chain with chain skill. 2nd, look at chain skill L, the ID is 54, which is the AOE spell flame II. The spell has now lifted upward, but the rest stay the same. Right now flame II will end the chain since there's no chain list, but adding spells to that will extend the chain further. Funny thing, you can technically change the skill chains all completely, the list above can change all of the single target spells into their AOE variants instead, or you can restrict the selection with various branches. It's some rather powerful stuff.\nI'm going to have to tone down Miriam's buff for this. For her to chain spell, she needs to use Intense Focus, but I set the MAT to +300%, which might be overkill with chain spell. I'll reduce that, but make a buffed version of her eye blast skill. The only other thing I need to figure out is how to set the status effect of magic burnout after magic focus dies out.\n\nThen I learned how to add new status ailments after an old status ailment has ended its turn, this will work for Miriam's magic burnout after her magic focus buff wears off.",
