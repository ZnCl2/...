The decentralized net kind of feels like the final evolution of the internet, a place where information flows completely freely and adults are allowed to think, talk and laugh. Like you said, it's impressive how well this actually works, even under a straining Tor network. Maybe zeronet just got a very needed injection of talented people that look to build a permanent home.\nThe ideal protocol for me would be something like\n>Tor like protocol with onion routing\n>All connected users are relays\n>p2p\n>Local storage is encrypted, decryption happens on content load or manually\n>A cryptocurrency is awarded for harddrive space and bandwidth sharing\n>This currency can be used on internal services or sold for dollars, to drive a psuedoeconomy and promote growth from greed\n>First upload will break up your file and share it to many users for a much faster seed, they will then share their pieces with others that consolidate them.\n>Lost files can be recovered if site user gets them from elsewhere\n\n>>59ac0a84-43ee-4638-b93c-5ab6c953558c\nThat could get really ugly, really fast. Makes thread pruning a necessity, or maybe a script that checks hashes, deletes duplicates and replaces them with a symlink to the original?",
