Josh doesn't seem to know what happened between hotwheels and Jim after he quit.\nPlus he is a born again christcuck who constantly moralfags about everything.\n\nPut that all together and he now wants 8ch dead and buried, he now literally believes creating 8ch was the worst mistake of his life and is trying to \"fix it.\"",
