It's the practice of limiting or completely preventing leaks of critical information that can used by an adversary against you.\n\"Good opsec\" is knowing upfront what information it is that you want to protect and taking reasonable steps in ensuring that it stays only with you.\nIn the context of anons that critical information is identity. I got bitten by hefty fine for torrenting because I failed to ensure my identity was not revealed. In a different setting it's different information. In a military conflict you know the identity of your opponent, but maybe not his position. So good opsec in that context is ensuring your position is not revealed.\n>If Tor and even VPNs are banned on there\nWith TOR you can always use bridges if a ban is in effect. If the outgoing direction is banned or if you are the only one in a network to be using tor you can always just SSH into another machine or a VPS. This prevents the \"associations attacks\" (like that university student book uploader who got caught, even though he did it through TOR, he was found because only a single connection on the campus was using TOR at the moment of the crime - his). And if you truly must ensure privacy at all cost, like living in a state that actively hunts you (eg. journalists in china), you can always rent a VPS with bitcoin, SSH into it and use TOR form the VPS. No banlist on earth can ban that and no reasonable method known can trace you back.\n>then what would be \"bad opsec\"?\nBut all of that for an anon would be \"bad opsec\". Because the whole mark of good opsec is \"taking reasonable steps\". Paranoia is not reasonable. It the same old classics: don't use private information, don't resuse nicks, never use you private E-Mail for shitty stuff. pic related. So now I'm one of those assholes, who torrents through TOR. (Although I also dedicate 25mbit of traffic to a TOR node to repent...)\nAll the great busts of hackers and drug dealers are never because of technology, it's always the shitty classics like paying with your credit card for illegal stuff or revealing your name. It's always that which fails. For that angle there is the bust of silk road for more info: https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/24/\ntl;dr: Don't be paranoid and don't be a moron",

(in that context it's not a server)\n>much it protects the Tor browser from compromise\nZeronet is completely independent from a browser. Your browser never connects to the internet. The reason that the TOR browser is recommended is for ease of setup of tor itself and if you use the same browser for clearnet and darknet, so that those things don't get conflated and that no privacy trackers or telemtry see darknet activity.\nYou can go to your firewall, completely block the browser from ever accessing the internet and zeronet still works.\n>would be a much harder app than the Tor browser\nThe Zeronet client uses a forked version of the bit torrent protocol. The attack surface for stuff like remote code execution is vastly smaller, since Zeronet is \"just a glorified torrent program\". There is no javascript to hijack, no SQL database to check for missing quotation marks. Itself zeronet suffers from the same thing bit torrent suffers from. Zero privacy if you don't have any proxy, since everyone sees your IP. It depends on TOR for that.\n\n> And why do those missing trackers return after Zeronet restart?\nI have seen this as well and would be interested as well. A question for the #zeronet IRC I suppose",

If their post was even close to the truth, VPNs could not work either with bt. Of course the TOR devs don't want bt traffic on their network, but their shitty stance on this by releasing bad info has been criticized for years.\n==Let's just quickly debunk that smut==\n>First attack \"popular Bittorrent clients just ignore their socks proxy setting in this case\nMaybe this used to be a bug in the past, but every torrent application has specifically a setting to only use the proxy exclusively. See pic 1, checkmark 2.\n>simply write your IP address directly into the information they send to the tracker and/or to other peer\nIf that was true, a VPN could not save you either. No anonymous bit torrent could even exist. But of couse that's bullshit. This is how PeX worked in the past. It should be disabled by default and if not, there is a checkmark for it with a tooltip saying use this shit if you use a VPN.\n>The second attack builds on the first one\nAnd is completly non-sense. If that was true, vpns would not help either. This is only the case, if you specifically tell the torrent application to use the proxy for trackers but not for peers. See pic1 checkmark 1. It's always enabled by default to not have this happen.\n>As a bonus, if the Bittorrent peer communications aren't encrypted\nYou wot cunt?! Encryption was always there since the invention of the bt protocol, at least in the spec. You can tell any bt application, even the most shitty one to reject all non encryption connection, just like you can only use https instead of http. But even if this was the case, this would not be bad. Everybody knows the content, it's p2p after all morons, we just hide the destination. Not the content needs protection, it's our identity. \n>exit relays can build short snapshots of user profiles based on all the streams\nThis is the most asinine one, the most ass backwards context free argument. The same if true for regular browsing too. If you watch a video over tor, the same is true. It's part of the so called \"association attack\" and no content is free from that. Besides that you would need a nation state actor to do so, all of TOR is >theoretically vulnerable to this.\n>>f385b4a0-c51b-4c6f-b728-7b174cd31e7e\nSo yeah. Tor has a problem with bt due to traffic constriction. That is ok.

Under the hood there is barely any difference between a bit torrent client and zeronet, but the context is certainly different. In the end, whether it's 3MB of website content going through bit torrent or over https is of no difference. It's 3MB of bandwidth on the shoulders of TOR either way.\n>>b3ba25ab-fad5-4ef3-a185-82177168cb0e\nAnd yet we are all here. In the decentralized deep net.

As long as you trust the proxy, Zeronet is bulletproof. Any anonymizing attack that can be used against TOR users, can be used against Zeronet users, as long as you use TOR as your Zeronet proxy. Association attacks, Timing attacks are all still technically viable, although much harder to pull off with the p2p angle. But unless the circumstances are perfect (being the only tor user on a campus network) you are pretty much bulletproof, as long as TOR remains bulletproof. With the US military relying on TOR, this is not gonna change any time soon.",

Shut off your router. Queue a post on 08chan, completely uninstall all browsers, and then reconnect the cable to have the post propagate. The browser is of no consequence and isn't even really involved with zeronet in the first place.\n>your node has a tor endpoint but you publish your own content until it gets mirrored\n>t's probably trivially to match them technically\nAnon just stop. Even a minute on the tor wiki page contradicts your bullshit.\nIn the TOR browser or without the browser via nyx, you can refresh you identity, circuit and endpoint every 60 seconds and every single post you make. The cert we post under identifies our content, but changing the cert and refreshing the identity completely breaks any piece of information that can be grouped. Of course you can be a dumb cunt and identify yourself ==by the content== of your posts, but that is just what a post is.\n>>fb8cac14-39e5-4921-9ba5-387204330cc9\nThe javascript without a browser is of no consequence. If it was anything else it wouldn't change the dynamic. If there is a privacy leak it will be there, be it javascript or not. The language here stops being a factor, because no browser is actually involved anymore. No scripts embedded within html that can leak your info. Ultimately this this can still be the case if you use the browser to access your local content, but you can just firewall it off and that danger is taken care of. How the structuring within Zeronet is done doesn't matter from that angle. It may be done with java or racket, the dynamic stays the same.\n>>accdfa93-12d2-42f9-a0b4-7ae00c3993f0\nI urge you to open the task manager or htop, w/e you are on. Zeronet is single threaded. It cannot and does not demand more than a single core from you. I'm seeding 5 zites, with \"Download and distribute all files\" enabled and the full history downloaded. The directory is 80GB. My RAM usage for Zeronet is 182MB, even though the last restart is over a day past.\nSure it pins that one core to 100% when posting or opening up a new site to serve content to the browser, but I think the whole resource angle is overstated. pic related. 43MB for tor, 182MB for Zeronet. Sure the browser is a 300MB hog, but that's today's bowsers anyhow...",
