The researchers believe the vulnerabilities are \"of the utmost importance and require attention.\"\n\nSee also: LokiBot malware now hides its source code in image files\n\nThere are three methods of attack which exploit the problems. The first allows hackers to use the \"quote\" feature in a group conversation to change the identity of a sender -- even if that person has not participated in a group chat.\n\nThe second is the alteration of a reply, which the researchers describe as \"essentially putting words in [a contact's] mouth.\"\n\nThe third is the sending of a 'private' message to another group participant which is actually masked as a public message, and so when responded to, everyone in a conversation can see the content.\n\nCheck Point attempted to reverse WhatsApp's algorithm to decrypt data and communication. The team was then able to see the parameters sent between the desktop and mobile version of the platform, and this information allowed them to develop the tool and conduct the attacks.\n\nFull technical details of the decryption and spoofing tool, as well as possible attack vectors, can be found in Check Point's blog post.\n........................\n>Trying to get out in front of some damning news",

Our sources say that there were no injuries visible and they began chest compressions while EMS were en route.\n\nEpstein was being detained for his upcoming trial for child and human sex trafficking and a barrage of other charges. Sources tell us that food vendors, all correctional officers who have been in contact with Epstein, as well as his water supply are being investigated following his suspicious death that is being reproted as a suicide.\n\nTwo weeks ago in a declared failed attempt to commit suicide, Epstein was placed on suicide watch. This means that aside from his cell being monitored remotely 24 hours a day by at least TWO cameras in his cell, 30 min round checks were also conducted by correctional officers.\n\nThere are reports from MSM claiming that Epstein hung himself which are categorically FALSE. Epstein’s body was cold to touch which means he had been dead for at least 4 hours, and if he had hung himself, one of the TWO cameras in his cell would have alerted the officers monitoring them. The reports being pushed through MSM are contradictory to that which our exclusive sources and the EMS recording states.\n\nThere would not have been a way for Epstein to commit suicide because while on suicide watch, one does not have clothes, bed sheets, or shoelaces. Inmates on suicide watch only have a smock and a hole in the ground for using the restroom. \n\nEpstein was found cold and unresponsive by EMS and was not considered a patient even though EMS is heard saying “working cold”. Sources also tell us no apparent injuries were visible on Epstein’s body, making it unclear how his death has been deemed suicide already without an autopsy. \n\nhttps://lauraloomer.us/2019/08/10/audio-jeffrey-epstein-dead-for-hours-on-suicide-watch-with-cameras-in-cell-before-ems-arrived/#.XVAuK0d7k5t\n\n",

			"body": "== FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EYES TO SEE……Let’s talk about EARS and NOSES. ==\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion on the 4ch about the difference in the ears and nose in Epstein Alive photos and the EMT picture of the Dead Epstein being brought to the hospital.   There has even been speculation that the Dead Epstein looks like Anthony Bourdain.\nUnless you are a Medfag or an Anatomy Professor, you will have to refer to the anatomy terminology that I posted to understand my discussion.   Please pay attention to three specific areas – the CRUS of HELIX,  the ANTERIOR NOTCH, and the INTERTRAGIC INCISURE / NOTCH. \n\n\nI compared all three ears, Bourdain, Dead Epstein and Alive Epstein.  The ears are all different, although Bourdain’s ear is more similar to the Dead Epstein picture. \nAs far as the noses go, well they also appear to be different.  Dead Epstein has a more rounded bridge of nose, but was it broken?  Bourdain’s nose is longer with a more rounded end.  It is difficult to be as certain with the noses, because you would have to have exact size photos in a frontal view to do measurements. \n\nWHAT I DO KNOW – The Ears are different.  The Alive Epstein and Bourdain pictures are authentic. \nWHAT I DON’T KNOW – Is the Dead Epstein EMT picture actually Epstein as he was brought into the hospital  OR  a picture of another emergency victim that the photographer/journalist used to post the story???\n\nSo guys,  Verify that the Dead Epstein picture is authentic… and we have got a proof. \n",

One such study conducted from 2010 to 2013 that looked at suicidal hangings in India found that hyoid damage was present in just 16 of 264 cases.\"",

Augustus, 69, a veteran acrobatic air show pilot and New Orleans-based member of a group that honored the Tuskegee Airmen, and Parker, 53, a TV journalist in New Orleans for more than two decades.\n\nParker was at the airport and was flying in Augustus’ propeller-driven airplane for a story she was doing on him.\nAugustus performed in air shows and also served as a flight instructor. The aviator, who said he grew up in a poor neighborhood in New Orleans, was a collector of Pitts Special aerobatic planes and had a love for the air show business.\n\nHe often visited schools to encourage black students to aspire to become pilots.\n\n“I want to let the young people know that if I can make it, anybody can,” he said in newspaper article from several decades ago.\n\nThe NTSB said it will release a preliminary report about the crash within a few weeks. A determination of probable cause will be issued at the conclusion of the investigation, which is expected to be completed in 12 to 24 months.\n\n\n",
