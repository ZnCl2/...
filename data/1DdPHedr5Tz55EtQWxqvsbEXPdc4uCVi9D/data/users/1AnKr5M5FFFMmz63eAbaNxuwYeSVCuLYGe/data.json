Incredible. TOR is unusable to post from because of abuse. Holy shit i thought i would never need this place. Fuck. I just knew this was gonna happen. \n",

Seems to be working as intended. Good Stuff. \n\nI was actually keeping a rather cool head by following codemonkey Ron on twatter. I got up thismorning fully expecting 8ch to back up on BitMitigate and i gotta say it was a rude shock to see even they got their hosting pulled. Yep everything is rented. Big suprise. \n\nIm sure they will be back up eventually but i must say \n\n- the shooter in elpaso did not feel right \n- the actions of cloud fare did not seem right \n- the wave of comments on 4chan disavowing 8ch and pol and anyone right of centre did not feel organic\n- the wave of hate against 8ch did not feel organic \n\nIt all stinks and feels like a targeted surgical military strike.
