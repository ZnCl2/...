Otherwise any zite can know your real IP by running xmlhttprequest even with Tor set to Always (I hate those labels btw, should be something like \"No\", \"Partially\" and \"Enabled\").\n>>29058305-c99a-4502-b7bc-24268e092d9a\nYeah the problem with snowflake browsers based on old Firefox code is that javascript support changes very rapidly, and as the code for the board is 100% javascript, the de-facto standards that are Chrome and Firefox are not in sync with the browsers based in old code.",

Never happened to me, nor has anyone else complained about that so far.\nEdit: in any case it works just fine with Firefox, it'll just be less secure than Tor Browser (but not any less secure than Palemoon).",
