If you're the only guy doing it then it becomes pretty obvious who the ID that posted 3 posts ever with a random-looking username in a non-overlapping period of time with other IDs who did exactly the same thing. Having multiple users doing it mitigates this, even though then you still need to have somebody else switch IDs in between the post you made with the previous ID and the new one both when you switch in and when you switch out of the ID. Or just switch back to an old ID after posting with the new one so the IDs overlap.\nI know this sounds complicated, but the tldr is it's actually very easy to link different IDs belonging to the same user with statistical analysis.\nAnd all that is without even considering profiling, time of day and stylometric analysis.",
