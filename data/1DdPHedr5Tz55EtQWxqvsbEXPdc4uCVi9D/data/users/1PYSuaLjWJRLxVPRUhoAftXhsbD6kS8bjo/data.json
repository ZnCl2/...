Someone has posted something and there's now an image that I'm not seeding in the board?",

I don't know how that could be arranged, though, without requiring everybody to download and seed absolutely everything, even the things they don't want. Seems like there should be a way to share this stuff through 08chan directly but I don't understand this place well enough to know if it's actually possible.",
