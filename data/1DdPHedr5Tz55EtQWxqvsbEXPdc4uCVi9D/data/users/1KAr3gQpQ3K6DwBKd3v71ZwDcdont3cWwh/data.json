Someone like Tim Wise, who is a very high profile, violent anti-white, might roll around in an armored car, but his car ain't bulletproof against everything. A decent .50 AP round or 7.62 SLAP will penetrate the bulletproof glass and even the armor used on many civilian grade armored cars and SUVs. If it penetrates light APCs and MRAPs, it'll punch through most civilian armored vehicles. In addition, there is always the McVeigh route if you want to cause some heavy damage against a building or institution.\n\nAnd if you still don't have the time or capability of approaching these targets, go for the local pro-immigrant NGO or leftist politician. Icing people in walmart is a waste of time.\n\nYou don't need heavy weapons, just a few hundred to a few grand, some basic marksman training, and a plan. No more than six months planning/training is really needed. As long as you can nail targets in 500 meter range consistently, you can do damage to these fags.\n\nIts infuriating because people keep choosing shit targets that don't lead to  anything. Imagine if just one of these retards hit a few journokikes or actual prominent anti-whites. Fucking panic all over the place.",
