Examining the ins and outs of the broader subject matter, looking which approaches have worked in the past, and more importantly, which ones have not. And you will notice all the ones revolving around softening up your politics and obfuscation of stances and subject matter, turn out to be non-solutions. It's like trying to dig away at a steel wall with a plush bear. No, the plush bear isn't going to cut it, no matter how much Locke - uh I mean Evola you read. ",

And their only frame of reference for the human condition or human behaviour, were other Europeans. They lacked the scope at which we now know how people of other ethnic clusters behave. How intrinsic those differences are. And because they lacked large samples of people of vastly different ethnic backgrounds across social standings to compare - unlike us - never made the connection that while some of their ideas may work within a 100% European population, they don't work with a multicultural one with people from all around the world. And the circumstance that their literature was created for and necessitates, cannot be recreated without vast amounts of bloodshed. They won't fuck off by themselves. You have to make them. So a different outlook has to come in. And we already have the information to create one.\n\nCulture is ultimately downstream from collective behaviour. One might say it is the sum of everyone's behaviour and how they interact with each other. Behaviour is ultimately heritable and downstream from genetic predispositions. You want to create a moral society? You want to make a stable society? Make a White one and everything else will follow at best, and in the worst case, at least be made possible in contrast to not doing so. The only outlook that leads to solutions in the long term, is a 100% ethnic one. Just look at the richest, most successful people right now. All their efforts and actions can't be explained by personal interest, but they can be explained by towing the line of benefiting the overall material standing of their ethnic ingroup. All I advocate, is to learn from the best. ",
