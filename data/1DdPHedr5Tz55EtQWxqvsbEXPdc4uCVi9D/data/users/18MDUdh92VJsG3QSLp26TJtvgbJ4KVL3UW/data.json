			"subject": "4chan being spammed",
			"body": "This is going to be a long post, you might want to grab a drink.\nToday, shortly after epstein's suicide, I noticed an image being circulated on 4chan. It presents itself as an email from shareblue and contains some unusual terms and links that have been dead (And likely never existed - more on that later).\nIf we assume it is real, then the picture has been edited, as there is no window it is being displayed in (Browser, email client, etc.). I didn't give it any serious thought and ignored it.\nNow, the filename this was posted with was stalwarts.jpg\n\nAfter a few hours of seeing this being posted, I noticed it was in every single thread, typically the first or first few posts. And the file name was the same every time.\nSo I went to the archive and searched the filename.\nhttps://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/filename/stalwarts/\n\nSome autists or a combination of autists and bots have been posting this for hours, nonstop. As of this sentence, the count is up to 282 posts.\nAs you all should know, when you save an image from 4chan it is renamed to a series of numbers. This isn't organic, the file name is the same every single time.\n\nI then noticed a new thread about this very topic, here's the archive link:\nhttps://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/222603814/\n\nThe mods deleted it before it could go anywhere terribly interesting, though it did start to fill up with shills spewing insults and unrelated comments.\nThe tl;dr part is that the links in the supposed \"email\" don't work and there is no archive or google cache of them. In all likelyhood they never existed. The mail address doesn't exist either, if you try to send an email it gets returned.\nAnother thread is made on the subject:\nhttps://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/222607404\nAnd shit started to get interesting. Several posters consistantly delivering one-line responses, denying evidence that anyone who clicks on the archive link can verify.  I would recommend browsing through it to see for youself.\nNumerous IDs enter the thread and seem strangely fixated on defending the legitimacy of the \"email\", disregarding that it's been spammed nonstop and ignoring allt he points made in the OP for a few posts until they are called out on it. More excuses, one line \"you're retarded\" insults, etc.\nIt devolves into nonsenical replies completely unrelated to the topic and seemingly unrelated to anything anyone was discussing, along with random accusations of \"purple anon\" and \"morpheus\".\n\nEventually OP gives up and drops it.\n\nNow any time I post and question why this image has been spammed for several hours, with the same fucking filename, in every thread, I get a bunch of (you)s completely denying anything suspicious is going on along with accusations of being \"moarpheus\" and links to posts talking about TRS for some fucking reason.\n\nI feel like I'm going nuts here anons. What the fuck is going on. This can't be normal, organic users spamming this shit and shutting down any conversation questioning it.",
