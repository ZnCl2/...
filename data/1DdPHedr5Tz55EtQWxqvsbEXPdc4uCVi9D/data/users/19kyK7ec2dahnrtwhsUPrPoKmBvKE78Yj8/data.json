IIRC the writefag wrote some spinoff shit to that story which I never got around to reading.\n\nAlso, I really like that story that PussPuss wrote about Octavia but the whole part where she's performing really triggered my autism. Here's why:\n>It didn't take long for the lights to dim and the sound of stomping hooves to fill the air as the show started. Then… you saw her.\n…Were they applauding before she went onstage? Why? The show doesn't start until she appears.\n>A beautiful grey mare walked up to the only stool on the stage, her cello case strapped to her side, then took a seat before setting her case down.\nTwo things: 1) cellists use chairs, stools are too high; and 2) the only things she should've brought onstage with her are her instrument and her music.\n>Keeping her eyes closed, she reached down for her instrument before getting into position with her cello resting on her chest.\nOkay, this ties in with what I mentioned before. The reason you're supposed to have your shit ready before going on is because nobody wants to see you fumbling around with your shit while you're onstage, and\n==SHE DIDN'T FUCKING TUNE HER INSTRUMENT. HOW DID SHE NOT SOUND LIKE SHIT?==\n**Also, I'm pretty sure it's really difficult to take out your instrument with your eyes closed** **:^)**\nAnyway,\n>Once she was ready, she lifted her bow into the air, silencing the stomping cheers in an instant.\nNo, string players would lift their bows and place them on the string when they are ready to play. Also, the audience would've stopped applauding moments after she bowed towards them and sat down.\n>Then, after a short moment of silence, she started to play.\nThis is probably the only thing in the entire paragraph that is actually correct.\n\nWell, there you have it. I don't expect everyone to acknowledge proper performing etiquette, or to even be aware that it's a thing, so I can't really blame the writefag. But that doesn't stop me from sharing my autism with you guys.",

			"body": "I really, ''really'' like this blog post:\n\nI find it fitting to elaborate on a few things which have been raised with me for some time. Notably, these are my depictions of characters in my FiMfics. I do not need to defend myself to anyone, yet I will explain myself so that people may understand.\n\nIt was suggested that I characterise two characters falsely - Prince Blueblood is the first, and the Setting is the second. Before I elaborate on this, I must define my own ideas regarding such. To begin with, Equestria (as in the Setting, the over-arching World within which takes place my story) must be certainly a character. It is no person, perhaps, but it is a character. Wherefore must it be? Because it contains how characters are responded to. To use an example, actions taken in Ponyville differ in response to actions taken in the Everfree Forest. So Equestria matters.\n\nI do not write a peaceful Equestria. Never have I, and I doubt I ever will. Why? In a sense, because of my interests and inspirations in the craft of writing. I look to Warhammer 40 000, to the Drenai Chronicles, and to other works besides, all where the battle between good and evil is not merely spiritual, but physical as well. They mislead you, who cry 'Peace!' when there is no peace.\n\nSo this is the first reason. I do not, as some falsely claim, merely act from ignorance - such presumption! - I rather act from what I see in the world, what the truth is. In fact it is they who act from ignorance. You who say in the evening that the weather will be fair, for the sky is red, and who say in the morning that it will storm, for the sky is red, can you not read the signs of the times?\n\nThe next reason lies in the sheer foolishness of some people, and in their hypocrisy. Fools! You who say that peace is the only condition of Equestria, and that war is unacceptable, do you not also write in your own stories that the only apparent romantic relationships are homosexual? You pack of wild dogs! You howling hyenas! Well it was said of you that where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather! Do you not see that if you declare one and yet the other is impossible, that you have lied to yourself?\n\nNeither one is impossible - indeed, if any were considered more possible, it would be that Equestria is not at peace. Explain to me, if you can, why Equestria would have fully trained guards if not against enemies. Explain to me why they are trusted to guard Canterlot if they are merely ceremonial. Come, let us reason together, for this is an important question.\n\nWho would stand against this is refusing the truth and prefers falsehood.\n\nIt is in response to this that I have characterised Blueblood as I have, and not only this but to a great condition that I have noticed both in MLP and in other media. This condition says that the only way that female characters can be 'strong' (this in itself could be rewarded with a full post…) is by male characters being weak or evil, or both. If you want another example of this, look at Frozen, or Maleficent. When was the last time you saw a good effective male character in a movie or TV show? When the only male characters in MLP are a toss-up between a glorified errand-boy, a farm-boy who does nothing, a pathetic simpering fool, and someone who can't tell his wife apart from a fairly unconvincing impersonator, something has to change. And so change it does.",

He started off in my first real FiMfic as the sole royal commanding Equestria in the face of a returning Nightmare Moon, who is set to destroy ponykind. Revisions changed him from leading a valiant but ultimately doomed last stand in an attempt to activate the still inert Elements of Harmony to defending Canterlot personally, and crossing swords with Nightmare Moon herself. This led into Not Worth A Bit, where he ultimately died in mourning of Octavia.\n\nThis was in truth a reaction to the 'idea' of shipping Octavia and Vinyl. Words can not describe my scorn for this idea.\n\nThen we get into my next story, which is called The Truth. This is my first real response to that shipping confusion aforementioned. Then we get to Words, The Bright Lady, Non Nobis Domine and beyond. My second 'mischaracterisation' occurs in these.\n\nIt is useless, really, to talk about these without understanding my context.\n\nI have already explained my context with regard to the broken peace of Equestria. But the rest of my context - my personal context, mind you! - is hidden. Well, nothing is hidden that will not be revealed. I am a Catholic - a papist, as some would call me. This matters so much to my writing that it is almost crucial, because it talks about my metaphysics. Good exists. Evil exists. Good will triumph, though for now we face the long defeat.\n\nWell, that's more than enough disjointed rambling for one fool to write in a night. I will leave you with these words.\n\nSometimes there is a way that seems right, but in the end it is the way to death.",

Keep in mind I like darker stuff, so if that's not your cup of tea don't check these out.\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/332433/student-of-the-night\n\nTwilight as an orphan in a world where Luna is a queen.  So far it has had some fights, some love interests, and some political stuff.  I don't know if I love it or not but it's better than a lot of the stuff out there in general quality, and the author updates semi-often.\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/322328/all-glory-to-the-overgoat\n\nThis one is rather humor focused.  It's a bit of villain reform, with \"human in a body he's not used to due to soul swapping\".  I enjoyed the interactions between characters mostly, but the plot is shaping up to be interesting as well.  Author hasnt updated since nov of last year.\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/147183/iron-hearts-book-1---planetfall\n\nIf you like WH40K, and you like Chaos, i'd give this one a try.  Ponies have to get used to the reality that a Chaos and the Tau have ended up on their planet, and they end up allies with Chaos.  So far there's 5 \"chapters\" with a few side stories by the same author.  The current \"main\" part of the story updating is https://www.fimfiction.net/story/289995/entrenchment\n\nStays very true to the WH40K universe without sacrificing wiggle room due to the chapter of Chaos Marines present being of little enough important to introduce OCs that aren't jarring.  It's pretty decent quality, and I'd recommend this even if you don't know much about WH40K – It got me to check the WH40K universe out with greater detail than I had before, and now I'm a fan.  Author updates not very regularly, but often enough that It doesn't suck too much to enjoy his work.\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/249782/magical-mystery-oops\n\nFor something a bit more lighthearted, and with what i'd consider really good writing and pacing, i'd recommend this.  Twilight gets turned into another Draconequus by accident, and Discord ends up mentoring her in how to be more chaotic.  Discord and Twilight start to show romantic interest in each other, and Discord also shows off that despite the fact that's he's chaotic, he also cares a great deal more than he lets on especially Twilight.\n\nGreat humor, great dialogue, good story so far, i'd just straight up have to recommend this one to everyone who isn't a corpse.  The only snag is that there's a big gap in time since the current update and the one before it.  To me this says it might not update as fast as it used to anymore.\n\n",

This one is just a bit of harmless fun.\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/214170/sweeties-shadow\n\nI really like this one because I like how Sweetie Belle and Sombra are paired as a kind-of father-daughter relationship.  Sombra gets ressurected after being destroyed by the power of love in the Crystal Kingdom, and is somehow attatched through some sort of soul shennanigans to Sweetie Belle.  As previously mentioned he ends up being a bit of a father figure towards Sweetie Belle, and protects and teaches her about things.  I really want to see where it goes, which is a damn shame because it hasnt updated in over a year.  I would not recommend this one if you hate stories that are good then just never update again, otherwise try it and then let it sit in your \"waiting for an update\" pile forever.\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/45860/diaries-of-a-madman\n\nI have a few more I could recommend, but I'll end off with this one.  It's well known enough that I wouldnt be surprised if it's already recommended or at least talked about in the thread (I haven't read through it all before I started writing this), but I'll give my own take on it either way.\n\nImagine Discord as an all-powerful god that has existed for a long time.  Easy enough, that's pretty close to how he's portrayed in FiM lore.  The twist is he's bored as fuck, and the only reason he ever \"lost\" to Celestia is because he thought it would be fun.  Starting at the season 2 opener and being continually written since then, this one is a whopper at 2mil words and counting.  Discord gives Celestia a choice; play this game with me and I wont just destroy everything out of boredom.  Through the deal (which wasnt really a choice) Discord introduces the human protagonist, Navarone, whose life has been horribily depressing and has a very dim outlook on life.  He's basically pessimistic nihilist at the start, and some of the shit that happens to him in the story doesnt make him want to change his mind that much.  As edgy and emo as he sounds, he's not a whiny emo bitch about it, he just really wants to be left alone.  Of course that's not going to happen.\n\nI like this one just for the sheer breadth of stuff that has happened since the start, and it's written in a way that I can't stop enjoying.  The protag is just such an unsufferable dick that everyone around him eventually gets used to it to the point where they can expose the emotions under the surface enough to understand him.  The ultimate goal at this point of Discord doing this is still not entirely clear even after 2mil words, but I suspect it's either just entertainment, or he's trying to create the only being in existence that can destroy him permanently because he's tired of living.  If I say any more theories i'd be spoiling.\n\nIf you want to read something that just doesnt seem to end with great dialogue, some sex here and there, casual nyphomania, heartwarming moments, narcisistic pessimism, and so on, this basically has it all.  If you end up enjoying it don't blame me for the blue balls you'll get waiting for updates.  Author doesnt update regularly, but when he does there's enough words in every chapter that you're jonesing for more by the end followed by a long pause while he gets around to writing more.",

And things naturally escalated from there.\n\nThe first half consists mostly of your run of the mill clop scenes involving Twilight giving in to the temptation of using her new found power on each of her friends, and includes things like domination, bondage, and pet play. I was a somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the fetishes much further than that, but I guess it's consistent with Twilight's character.\n\nThe story aspect picked up around half way through, when Twilight inadvertently **revealed the spell to [REDACTED] and promptly had the table turned on her. The rest of the story details her struggle to wrestle back control**.\n\nIt's the second part that made the story stood out among all the other clopfics. Whereas in most other clopfics the 'plot' merely acts as a flimsy glue that carries the story from one clop scene to the next, often through contrived means that stretches beyond disbelieve (a lot of bad stories in general falls victim to this, only there's no sex to distract the readers), the author here had clearly put more through into the story progression than most other fanfiction 'writers' out there.\n\nThe result is that the escalation of events felt natural, and at no point did I feel that the characters were deliberately dumbed down to coerce the story down a certain path. The author had not let Twilight's intelligence gone to waste. Indeed, Twilight's story would have ended in **Chapter 16** were it not for **the various contingencies she had put in place beforehand, and her continued careful planning afterwards. From that point on until the end, while Twilight was still susceptible to [REDACTED]'s control even as she's secretly planning to fight back without giving herself away, made for some genuinely suspenseful moments. And the several scenes of herself being played with while under the effect of the spell was just a sexy, sexy bonus**.\n\nRead this if the fetishes listed hits all the right spots for you, and you also want a good story to go with the porn.",

Now that I think about it, Applejack sells apples like she is a little kid with a lemonade stand.  Twilight can act like an adult occasionally–an obsessive and unhinged adult.

The cartoon shows a freakin' enormous orchard–hills covered in apple trees that just go on and on.  That's the kind of thing that, in our world, would require hundreds of laborers at harvest time, and you wouldn't be selling those apples a few at a time at a local farmer's market.  Well, maybe you'd sell a handful of them that way–but that size business, you're making telephone calls to buyers at nationwide supermarket chains and that big cannery down in Baltimare that makes applesauce and apple jelly.  And time spent on the phone negotiating with cutthroat grocery store chain buyers is time not spent kicking trees to make the apples fall out.\n\nAnd I think the Apples have other stuff to sell too–they've got everything from a dairy operation with a non-trivial number of cows.  Let's say a dozen cows at eight gallons of milk a day each, which is what a big Holstein cow is capable of if she's in good health and getting a good diet–call it a hundred gallons of milk.  every day.  the cows have to be milked, the milk has to be at the very least put into sterile containers for transport to somebody who's gonna buy it, some's gonna be set aside to be made into butter and cheese, and on and on.\n\nAJ, Big Mac, and AB do all this by themselves?  Every single day?  With Granny Smith cooking for them and keeping house, I guess?  I'm starting to find this a little hard to believe.  Even if the cows are sentient and can milk themselves.\n\nYeah, I know.  Cartoon.  We're still looking at an ENORMOUS farm business with a yuge orchard attached to it.  But maybe they do hire help from time to time, and we just don't see it happening onscreen.",

And it is even worse than that.  Apparently they personally haul carts full of pies that Granny Smith baked to isolated villiages on the other side of swamps while Sugar Cube Corner in town makes all of their own pies.  Their cider business is supposedly profitable, but they consistently leave half a town full of paying customers wanting due to their lack of sufficient labor power.  The Apples are the biggest landowners in Ponyville, and their business practices are so bad, even in-universe, that they are barely solvent.\n\nMeanwhile, Rarity has made herself bourgeois by selling designer dresses in a nudist colony.  That is one of the potentially fun aspects of the Rarijack ship–Mrs. Rarity Apple decides one day that she wants to look at the books and find out where all of Sweet Apple Acres' profits are going only to discover that they are just a log of how many apple trees Applejack and Big Macintosh kicked each day.  Because this is a farm.  We don't need no fancy mathematics.\n\n>And I think the Apples have other stuff to sell too–they've got everything from a dairy operation with a non-trivial number of cows.\nThey also have pigs, chickens, and sheep; yet you never hear about Apple Family ham, eggs, or wool.  It's not like there would not be a market in town for eggs and wool either.  We have seen Rarity and Sweetie Belle eating eggs, and Sugar Cube Corner must buy eggs like they are going out of style.  Locally produced and woven wool would be a selling point for a fashion boutique that makes custom suits, the kind of thing that someone like Rarity would pay through the nose for.  We have also seen bologna sandwiches, but I doubt that was intentional.\n\nOh, and let us not forget that orchards are absolute cash cows IRL.  Have you ever met an orchard owner?  They live like the planter aristocracy of old.  The Apples must be doing a lot of things spectacularly wrong (as \"Applejack's Day Off\" heavily implied) for them to not be very well off.",

Apples get nibbled on by worms and insects, gnawed by worms.  They grow lopsided.  They get a rotten place on one side that a farm housewife IRL would slice off with a paring knife and then put what's left in the bucket to be made into apple butter.  IRL visually inspecting and sorting the fruit–only the prettiest and most perfect will bring a high enough price to make shipment by truck worthwhile, the rest become canned food or are eaten by the family (this is why you can't find good lobsters in grocery stores in Maine–the goodlooking ones get put on ice and shipped to New York and Chicago and Miami, leaving the deformed and ugly ones for local consumption).  Anyway, my point is, all of this takes lots of eyes and lots of hands (or hooves, I guess) and it still seems implausible to me that three ponies, one of whom is a young kid, are able to do this on a freakin' enormous farm that must have at least half a square miles that's just apples, PLUS hogs, PLUS cows, PLUS chickens, PLUS Big Mac pulling that plow back and forth across ginormous-looking fields for–what, carrots? corn? tomatoes? soybeans? some other vegetables they grow too.  I know, it's a world where magic exists.  I know, it's a cartoon.  But still.\n\n>>051e9369-cf6f-432f-9802-248e52ccf69d\n>The animators do not seem to always be in the loop.\n\nI've heard the claim that the writers haven't necessarily ever watched a single episode of the show, and there's no one in charge with an overarching vision.  It's a free-for-all with little or no continuity, and once they can hammer out a script, every single line of dialogue, every note of every song, every single joke, has to be approved in a dozen meetings with Hasbro bigwigs.\n\nI've been accused of trolling for saying it, but despite the technically superior animation we saw later on, I prefer Season 1's episodes.  Hasbro caught lightning in a bottle when they had Faust and Larson working together.  Ever since they left they've been trying to recapture that, but for five and a half seasons since then it just hasn't been the same.  In my opinion.",

As you may be able to tell by some really stupid mistakes. (Also I suck at proper punctuation, it's a serious problem.)\n\nMost of the notes were simply implemented with some unneeded sentences cut out entirely.\n\nOne note, however, as removed by correction that brought up a good point. It takes quite a while for ponies to show up in the story, or even be hinted at. There is in fact a pony character that the POV switches to a few times throughout the story and I was wondering if it would make for a better second chapter and moving the current one down.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1H0kxuZDLx4qwrUmjOLuaMsx55xI9L82tl3s977da1X0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nI hadn't considered it before, but it would provide a valuable break that would strengthen the concept that a lot of time has passed and get ponies into the story a bit earlier rather than simply hinting at them.",

If a character has an accelerated aging spell, he is not just going to age his enemies to death in combat, he is also going to grow crops quickly and get rich revolutionizing agriculture. If a character wants to communicate with another character securely over text, he is not going to write his message in riddles, he is going to use a one-time pad. If a character wants to hide something where no one will ever find it, he is not going to put it in a cave near his childhood home and protect it with an army of zombies, he is going to sneak into NASA and stuff the McGuffin into a space probe.\n\nIf a character has an information source that can only provide true-or-false answers, he is going to use binary search and quickly tear through the search space to arrive at the answer. If a character can erase memories, he is going to realize that he can get people to do whatever he wants by mindwiping them over and over again until he finds a sequence of words that is persuasive. If a character has irrefutable evidence that an afterlife exists, he is going to stop treating death as this horrible thing which must be avoided at all costs and is going to think of it more as a forced 80-x year vacation to Australia (where x is the age of the dead character).\n\nBasically, imagine you are in the middle of World War II. Imagine someone proves beyond a shadow of doubt, that ghosts or spells or souls or dragons or whatever exist. Forget about tropes and cliches and evil bad guys in skull thrones. Think about how realistic, ruthless, opportunistic, cold, pragmatic people on both sides would exploit these magical discoveries to help them win the war. That's the mindset a rationalist applies when he finds himself living in a fantasy world.\n\nTry ''The Moon's Apprentice'' for a great example of pony rational fiction.\n\nhttps://fimfetch.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice",

That's the mindset a rationalist applies when he finds himself living in a fantasy world.\nYou more or less described what actually happened with radar and nuclear fission.",

The impression I got from reading HPMOR is that a large part it involves: 1. taking established ruleset and 2.abusing the hell out of it. Don't get me wrong, I still like it and so far haven't found anything makes me want to bang my head against the wall in frustration (''unlike '''so''' many other fics I could name''), but I was kinda hoping for something more akin to Harry Potter and the Natural 20.\n\nAlso, there are two minor things that I wish were (or will be) explained. First is how Nightmare/Luna manages to convince Twilight's parents to let Twilight study under her from the get go. No matter how desperate they are for Twilight to realize her talent, surely they have to be a bit wary when a monster from 'an old mare's tale' visits them in their dreams and offers their daught an apprenticeship? There must be a bit more to it then that. Second, when Twilight first moved to Ponyville, she idly wondered if Luna had helped financing the estate. How? How does an entity banished a millennium ago still holds assets? Is it the pony equivalent of a thousand year old Swiss bank account? Ancient cults with deep pockets? Or perhaps she could use her dreamwalking ability to gain insider knowledge and guide the Sparkle family in profiting from the stock market? Again, something else the author could have afforded in going into slightly more detail.",

			"body": "So! I finally finished ''The Moon's Apprentice'' about two nights ago and because I can't word gud, I'm just gonna put down my thoughts on the fic in bullet points as they occur to me.\n\n - One of my speculation from >>bdd0ae83-8092-4477-9af8-b9ef28fde706 turned out to be correct, Luna does have agents working for her in Equestria.\n\n - The **Sunset/Twilight** reveal: I habitually read through the comments of each chapter as I finish them, and one of the commenters correctly predicted the twist, so I kind of accidentally spoiled myself there. But from a technical standpoint, I think it is fairly well done. There's enough information and foreshadowing for the astute readers to put all the clues together. Subtle enough to blindside most readers, but not so out of the blue to be regarded as an asspull (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asspull).\n\n - The pacing felt… off. To elaborate, the story climaxed at the point of Twilight's ascension and the imminent confrontation with Celestia that ensues. After all, it's the culmination of all her hard work, the goal she set out to achieve all those years ago (there's also Luna's safe return, but the story ended with that just on the horizon). But, her ascension happened at a point where there's another half of the fic left to go, so I naturally assumed that after a brief respite, the story would  start building towards the final, real, showdown. Instead, it shifted into lower gear and began to lose steam from there on out.\n\n - The ending left me… dissatisfied, by its lack of any real resolution. In the end, nobody really won and nobody was vindicated, everyone was left unhappy and the conflict barely reconciled.\n\nI think I sympathize with Celestia the most, she left Equus believing Luna to be still under the influence of dark magic, and while she may play it off as taking an extended vacation to Twilight, in reality it won't be easy spending the time in solitude and self-imposed exile, away from everyone she knew or cared about for however many years to come.\n\nAnd as Twilight herself said, their victory felt hollow, as it was all but handed to them by Celestia. Twilight still has all that anger and hatred unresolved, and I see little difference in how she feels towards Celestia between the little filly in the beginning and the Alicorn of Magic at the end of the story. I'm quite disappointed by the lack of character growth on that front.\n\n - As the fic was recommended to me as a rational fic, I couldn't help but unintentionally try to draw parallels between it and Methods of Rationality, the only other rational fic I've read. And for the longest time, I fully expected Nightmare!Luna to pull a Quirrelmort, playing the role of a sociopathic master schemer, manipulator, putting on a 100% convincing mentor figure to Twilight in order to achieve her goals, and Celestia the well intentioned chessmaster that the protagonist unfortunately butt heads with due to their difference in ideology. Well, that didn't happen.\n\nI know it's unfair for me to dive into the fic with these expectations, as not only MoR codified the genre and set a very high bar for me, but also to the best of my knowledge the author never intended for this story to be seen as a rational fic, but I that's what I would've prefered.\n\n - Finally, now that I've finished the fic, if I were to hazard a guess on why it's considered a rational fic by the Lesswrong group on Fimfiction, I would put my money on how Twilight responded to **Dash's** unexpected ascension. By way of introspection, she identified the root cause that lead to the disaster, and made effort to remedy that. There might be other similar moments, but that's the only one that came to my mind. It's quite possible that there are other rationalist ideals demonstrated in this story, but if so it's not obvious enough for me to spot it.\n\nWell, I think that about wraps it up. Sorry if I rambled on a bit too much.\n\nNext I will be digging into ''The Rise and Fall of the Dark Lord Sassaflash''. I discovered it through the /r/Rational subreddit after this thread rekindled my interest in rational fanfics, and realized that I'm already familiar with the author's other work, ''Mendacity''. Already I got a feeling that this is going to be good, if what OP said proved to be true: \"[The Pratchetty-ness] lasts until the trip to Hollow Shades. From there to the tomb, it's Lovecraft, and from the tomb to the end, it's Yudkowsky\".\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/93572/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dark-lord-sassaflash\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4s1p4g/the_rise_and_fall_of_the_dark_lord_sassaflash/",

Interviews for the position to be conducted at 108 Haybale lane at 10:00 AM _sharp_ on 4/7. Applicants are expected to be _*punctual*_.\n\n>—The Dark Lord Sassaflash\n\nAlright, I'm done with The Rise and Fall, and I definitely enjoyed it. Really, how could you not get hooked right in with an intro like that? The two predominantly featured protagonists, the self-proclaimed dark lord, Sassaflash, and her minion, Mr. Mule, are both gifted with a wonderfully distinctive character voices and personalities that the author played off of to excellent effect, as shown early on in the story:\n\n>The following hour or two were among the oddest of the Mule’s life. Things began quietly enough; after finishing the herbal tea prepared by the Mule (“Always use worrywort when preparing my tea, Mister Mule, and always use three leaves. And only use it for my tea. It is my tea, not yours. You can’t have any. My tea”), Sassaflash trotted back to her overburdened wooden table and scribbled out a few lines of script, which she rolled up into a little scroll. Turning to the Mule, she said, “There is an amateur veterinarian of sorts who lives on the borders of the Everfree forest. Take the side road on Stirrup Street opposite the haberdashery, and then just keep on going away from town until you reach her hut. I wish you to deliver this there.”\n>He leaned forward and gingerly took the scroll in his mouth. “Ysh Mss. Thnn I gvv it too thish vetrinrnn?”\n>“What? No.” The teal pegasus frowned. “Of course not, she’s an idiot. Goes around singing to wild animals. She probably writes poetry. No, I want you to deliver this to a small rabbit living with her; she calls him ‘Angel Bunny,’ for some deranged reason. Ask for him at the door, and then give him this and tell him it came from me. You will attempt no further communication with either the milksop or the rabbit, and will return here immediately. Is this understood, Mister Mule?\n>He dropped the scroll to the floor and said, “Understood, Miss Sassaflash, but…”\n>The mare raised an eyebrow. “What?”\n>Gesturing towards a clicking, whirring thing on the wall that he was reasonably sure was either a clock or a device for puréeing cabbage, the Mule asked, “Ain’t it a mite late—or early, as might be said—to go a-knocking on ponies’ doors?”\n>“Nonsense. Just knock hard enough, and you’ll eventually get a response. Use fire if absolutely necessary.”\n\nThere is a light sense of Pratchett early on in the story where the atmosphere permits, but once the two's adventure began proper, that soon gave way to descriptions of grand vistas and evocative imageries, as well as the foreboding sense of cosmic dread that is the staple of any Lovecraftian setting, though thankfully without the overly purple prose.\n\nThe author indicated that this story is set in the same universe as his previous work, Mendacity (that heavily focused on changelings and other creatures of folklore), although names of the Old Ones and a certain location are directly lifted from the mythos, which is just as well because I don't want to see the result of attempts at ponifying a name like Nyarlathotep with bad horse pun.\n\nHighly recommend this if you're looking for an adventure story with some worldbuilding and elements of the occult.",

So first fic, \"The Incredibly Dense Mind of Rainbow Dash\", takes place at  the same time as S2E17 \"Hearts and Hooves Day\". Meanwhile, the climax of the main fic ''The Life and Times of a Winning Pony'', happens simultaneously with S2E26 \"A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2\". So of course changelings play a big role. But it is vital to the story's conceit, and it is well integrated into the plot.",

The writing is very good and the story not too complicated but the characters are compelling and have a personality. There is politics, war, adventuring, emotion etc  im currently on chapter 13/64 but this is highly recommended!\n\nAlso this guy did some sick 10/10 narration but stopped at chapter 11 due to personal reasons:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuBq0jnmyPI&list=PLjhQxIEx0dDEcjiicrO6_AGqf7XZ20I0R\n\nSummary:\n\" Three hundred years after the fall of Princess Luna, Equestria teeters on the brink of disaster. Bitter political infighting and power-hungry nobles threaten to tear the country apart in a bloody civil war, while in the south old enemies prepare to reclaim their ancient homeland from the ponies.\n\nAs Princess Celestia desperately strives to hold together her splintered nation, she sends a young pony on a quest to the northern lands that border Equestria in order to plead for aid against the threat of Grypha. This unlikely messenger is Rye Strudel, the flightless, magicless, half-breed son of a guard and a baker. Rye must do the impossible and unite the thanes of the north… for if he cannot, there may be no home to come back to. \"",

During the magic show, **the unicorn chains up a family member in invisible chains, causing the family to kick the unicorn out. Later, the protag finds the unicorn near a river, and she shows him levitation magic with her horn, and then rants about some dumb analogy for not believing in herself or someshit.**\nAnyway, the fact that I can still remember the story today already makes it better than 95% of the fics I've read, which is why I want to find it again.",

Ah well.\nIt's been long since I've read an actual good ponyfic. Any anon have any recommendations? I was planning on reading To Perytonia (https://www.fimfiction.net/story/383344/to-perytonia) at some point, but it's far too long to binge within a weekend.\n\n>>cbe689e3-b33c-404b-b752-ad846ba81c24\nThis story ended up in my shit folder, as well as the one above it (>>a89805f7-a409-4dff-b5fb-465632be0dad).\nBoth of these stories would have ended up in my Good folder at least, if it weren't for the political aspect behind these stories.\nI don't know if other anons feel this way, but the motivations and general feel of stories like those have a rather telling leftist subtext in them.\nTo take ''Why She Looks So Good'' as an example, first off, Rarity in this story is a literal Jew. That in and of itself isn't bad, because rarity is a fucking worthless whore. The real problem comes from the fact that Twilight (and eventually the protagonist) praises her for being intelligent due to her Jewishness. Hitler had many non-sequiturs in Mein Kampf about this kind of intelligence…\n>The art of shirking was looked upon almost as a proof of superior intelligence, and devotion to duty was considered a sign of weakness and stupidity.\n>Another paragraph more on the point that I couldn't find\nAnd I understand that I am seeing ill intent in stories that likely have no such thing. However, that doesn't stop the general disgust and repulsion that I (and likely any other NatSoc anon) feel whenever I see shit like this.\n\nTo give another example, The Descendant writes fics that most people (myself included) love to read. Several of his fics are the best I've ever read.\nAt the same time, leftist influence can be painfully obvious in some of his stories. One which I read pretty recently was Every Little Bit (https://www.fimfiction.net/story/130213/every-little-bit), which, like most TD fics, has nothing but praise from the comments.\nI hated this fic's first chapter. It paints the archetypal male as disgusting, while cleanly ignoring the implications of female dominance and extortion against the population. The second chapter makes an attempt to fuck with gender roles, with the theme of \"It's okay to be me\" on having the behavior of the opposite sex.\nThe second chapter was actually pretty funny for me, because it incidentally served as a reminder that all trans/homo/lesbian/fagniggers are only that way as a result of having a completely fucked up family history, with spike having been raised by an adopted single mother, and Dash's parents having divorced early on, causing her to be raised by a sole male figure.\nBut that clearly wasn't the actual intention of the story, with the real intention to spread the idea that it's okay to be gay (and in the case of the story above—that it's intelligent to be Jewish).\n\nI think my shitpost is long enough. Maybe this thread can hit the bump limit within this year. 16 months and barely more than a hundred posts…\n\n",

My tastes are fickle like that.\n\nI think the main enjoyment I got out of this story was derived from the beginning, with Starlight's callous attitude towards Twilight's death and seeing Spike, playing the sensible one, being traumatized.\n\nBesides, short comedies are pretty much just multiple jokes packaged into a coherent narrative anyway. When you're constrained by the word count, there's only so much plot advancement or character development you can squeeze in.\n\nNow that it's evident that your standards and perhaps preferences are vastly different from mine, I'm a lot more hesitant to offer recommendations from my \"good-ish\" collections without knowing if there's any particular type of story you're looking for. I know I'm a lot more forgiving of a story's shortcomings if the initial premise that drew me in is executed decently enough.\n\nSo, if you want something with perhaps a little more depth (that is to say, with a bit more complexity than your typical Skyrim side quest) and don't mind the wordcount, try one of my previous recommendations ( >>cad5551c-95f1-4079-a950-cb6486a6ee24 ), I think the first one or two chapters is enough to get you acquainted with the author's writing style and let you decide whether it suits your preference.\n\n'''The Rise and Fall of the Dark Lord Sassaflash'''\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/93572/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dark-lord-sassaflash\n",

You want a melancholy story that could only be described as beautiful throughout and make you want to cry both sad and happy tears at the end? This is the story. None of that anti-saccharin-ness that send you careening into depression like ''My Little Dashie'' did.\n\nNow, looking through my Fimfic bookmarks to see if there are more recent additions I could recommend…\n\nTechnically a crossover: ''The City Must Survive''\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/423866/the-city-must-survive\nIn which the characters of MLP are pitted against the unforgiving environments of a frozen, post-apocalyptic world. No prior knowledge of the setting is required for the readers to empathize with the characters and experience the unrelenting ''despair'' that permeates this short story.\n\nAn Optimalverse story: ''Heaven's Not Enough''\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/363503/friendship-is-optimal-heavens-not-enough\nThis is a story of a young woman, and the gradual collapse of society seen through her eyes from her rural hometown of Concrete, Skagit County, Washington.\n\nA mirror to the ponies: ''Queen of Queens''\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/206017/queen-of-queens\nA rather unique worldbuilding story for the changeling race and the Queen we come to know as Chrysalis.\n\nLibrary of Babel meets My Little Pony: ''Twilight's Library''\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/205258/twilights-library\nWho doesn't like a bout of existential blues coupled with claustrophobic dread every once in a while?",

Although, if it's really as bad as you say, what could possibly have possessed you to read through all of it?!\n\nAnyway, I have for you guys, you guessed it, another recommendation(!)\n\nI'd like to give exposure to something I'm still binge reading through that I hope y'all will enjoy. I was going to recommend this after I finish the existing chapters, but whatever: '''The Unique Properties of Dark Magic'''.\n\nDon't let the weird cover art or small number of likes fool you, the story exceeded my initial expectations by a wide margin.\n\nhttps://www.fimfiction.net/story/439232/the-unique-properties-of-dark-magic\n\nThe story is somewhat unconventionally structured, with one plotline following the arrival of the former human, Weiss Noir, outside the Crystal Empire a thousand years in the past. And details his experience in learning dark magic and leading a bunch of rescued crystal ponies outside Sombra's tyrannical reign.\n\nThe other plotline is set during Season 1. Weiss Noir, now the expert of the dark arts, escapes from imprisonment and proceeds to meddle with events of the show, annoy Celestia, and prepare for the return of Sombra in order to exact his revenge.\n\nThe chapters from the two timelines are interspersed, alone with pages from Weiss Noir's notes on new spells and inventions sandwiched between, detailing their discover and capability.\n\nNow moving onto what I particularly like about the story.\n\nThe humor. Weiss possess a snark and wit similar to Mark Watney's from The Martian, and made creative use of metaphors, similes, and wordplays to invoke hilariously absurd mental imageries (read the chapter ''(Weiss Report) Unlimited Blades Work'' if you want to see what I'm talking about). There is no shortage of such humorous moments throughout the story.\n\nThe inventiveness. Researching dark magic is kind of his special talent, and Weiss made many discoveries and inventions as the story progressed, sometimes aided by the knowledges and insights from the human world. Expect more corny puns, wordplays, and culture references in the naming of his discoveries, he's utterly shameless and unapologetic about it.\n\n''tl;dr This is the closest we will ever get to witnessing Mark Watney MacGyver-ing new spells and artifacts out of dark magic.''\n\nHowever, tastes differ, and I would be remiss if I don't also give awareness to a few aspects of the story that might turn some people away from reading, or that requires some suspensions of disbelief on the reader's part.\n\n- Firstly, there is no denying that Weiss Noir possesses qualities that, when viewed in certain light, may seem somewhat Sue-ish. He's able to stumble upon, invent, and master new spells at a rather absurd rate, albeit the pacing and circumstances of the story kind of demands it. On the flip side, despite these qualities, he's still an engaging character to follow, owing to his ability to be as manencing, humorous, well spoke, or crass as the situation demands.\n\n- The rate of progress. Within the span of a few months, Weiss and his fellow ponies managed to eke out an existence in huge underground complexes hidden under the frozen planes outside of the Crystal Empire. While their ability to quickly mine, expand, and build is partially explained by the crystal ponies' natural talent at shaping and manipulating crystals and rocks; what's harder to explain away is the sizable teams of scientists and researchers that Weiss assembled out of the citizenry, and their ability to develop advanced machinery, magical holographic displays, rudimentary computer analogues, and cloning facility in the short period of time. How much of that is owed to novel applications of existing magic and knowledge and how much was taught to them by Weiss was not made clear.\n\n- Absolutely nothing of our protagonist's former human life is touched upon, or how he came to be in Equestria. Personally I'm glad of this omission. My takeaway after reading so many HiE stories, is that most attachments to the previous life only serves to weigh down on the the protag and the reader's heart, or act as a convenient filler for the more emo types to waste words to angst on.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you like all the typical tropes of a Isekai story, you might want to give this one a shot.",

So any rules could only be enforced by gentlemen's agreement.\n\nBy the way, I have a slight technical question: in the zeronet sidebar, there's a toggle for \"download and distribute all files\", but that seems to imply it's applied to the whole 08chan site. Is it possible to do that for the /pone/ board?\nI know about board pinning on the homepage, but I'm not sure that's working as intended as I still have to fetch the full image every time I click on an thumbnail.",
