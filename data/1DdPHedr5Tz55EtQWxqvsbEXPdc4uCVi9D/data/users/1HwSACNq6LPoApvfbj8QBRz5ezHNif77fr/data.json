When that happens we must drive them all out. Our new host will without a doubt be spammed with emails telling them to shut us down because we're rayciss. We on the other hand must spam them with emails that support their decision in hosting 8chan and freedom of speech. \n\nBe prepared for the worst, but don't lose hope. 8chan will never fall. It is our **home**. ",

			"body": "To the few of you who weren't tech illiterate cuckchanners and have managed to find this bunker, do not lose hope. CM has proved to not be that much of a faggot after all and along with Jim they will get our home back up online soon. The shootings were used as an excuse to bring us down because we're too much of a threat to the kikes and their plan of total information control. Everyone and their mother is after us, either because they're braindead sheep that follow the status quo or because they feel threatened by our existence. \n\nOnce 8chan is back online, be prepared for the biggest wave of redditors and faggots that we've ever experienced. The site will get flooded as an attempt to suppress discussion, similar to what happened to cuckchan. Vols must remain vigilant and respond to this upcoming shitstorm, and anons need to counter this attack by following these simple rules:\n>Do not respond to slide threads\n>If you do respond, always sage\n>Always report & hide slide threads/outsiders\n>If truly needed, spam gore\n\n'''Do not spread out to other obscure imageboards, it will only decrease our numbers.'''
