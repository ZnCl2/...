The links are made at least, that's how I was able to at least bring some of those images back; I took what images I uploaded and copied them into the src folder in the user data folder, then renamed them to what the file shows up in the link, and started the seed.  It was a pain in the ass, but it worked.  I'll have to do that for the pics I uploaded here and from now on once I get back.",

I'll be writefagging more stuff on /monster/ as well.  I figure I can keep pushing updates for Anon's Bizarre Adventure whenever they crop up from the jewker.",
