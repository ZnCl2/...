You can blacklist \"bad\" users to prevent further content from them or you can blacklist bad boards. But you are still at risk of discovering bad image and thus starting to seed it (by default its thumbnail only). Solutions?\nA) Find bad image manually via zerohello, Files tab and delete it.\nB) use Tor to anonymize yourself and do not worry what you are hosting\nC) use Millchan ( http://127.0.0.1:43110/1ADQAHsqsie5PBeQhQgjcKmUu3qdPFg6aA/ ) where muting/blacklisting user and board means deleting all the hosted content (usually only small image thumbnails, because you have not likely clicked the ba dimage to see its full size).",

Here is the zeronet.conf file parameters you can use:\n\n[global]\ntor = always\ntrackers_proxy = tor\ndisable_udp\n\nNote that you should have \"[global]\" only once in the file and on the top.\n\nDescription of the parameters: In \"Tor: always\" mode, peer connections are made thru the Tor network. Connections to all tracker are still made over a normal internet connection. (This should not be the problem as the tracker connections does not cary any sensitive information and tor connections are slower). To have even tracker connections encrypted, we use \"trackers_proxy = tor\".\nTor is not using UDP so that is why there is \"disable _udp\" option, but this option is likely not needed and when later disabling tor, it may be unwanted (limitting connections possibilities). So actualy all needed should be:\n[global]\ntor = always\n\nzeronet/log/debug.log, zeronet/log/error.log can help in debugging issues",

Simply you have to treat that \"Help distribute all\" option the way that it has #1 priority regarding seeding. Simply if you enable it, you download everything (as name says). Muting then works the way that it hide the content from your sight + delete the files, which then gets again downloaded (as a cause of \"Help distribute all\" function) i bet.

Why? because this is a custom blacklist of this site and i bet it is not in any universal zeronet supported fashion which would the mentioned function was programmed to ignore such a blacklist files. Very unlikely in my opinion. \n\nAnother possibility why zeronet not re-downloaded the CP you have deleted is that it maybe does not constantly reattempt to download every file (it may be computer resources intensive?) or it will not attempt to download it again at all (maybe until \"Check files\" option is executed within ZeroHello site?) or it will attempt with some delay. It is the question how ZN is developed, but again i think it is unlikely the \"Download and help distribute all files\" option is caring about local site board blacklist. Maybe it can care about user blacklist as i think it is managed internaly by zeronet (zeronet/data/filters.json), ZeroHello, three dots menu, Manage muted users.. but i also doubt the function is made to care, i think the fucntion means that it will instruct zeronet to download all optional files (images etc.) and if you delete completely downloaded image, ZN will not possibly re-attempt DL. -> do not enable that all files downloading option if you do not want to seed everything on this site.

Maybe if some hacker/group setup too many zeronet computers (peers) and monitor connections + which posts apearing when. Unsure if these may come with some acceptable probability.\n\n> controlling a large number of the nodes\nTor relays usually proccess alot of traffic, how do you differentiate zeronet peer connections from non-zeronet and match it to an IP (peers does not interconnect dirrectly in Tor mode and also the traffic is encrypted if i understand correct) while that discovered (if possible) IP can be regular peer not an initial poster. This is several layers to break and they can count only with probability in my opinion.\nEven if they can come with some probability (to match IP to a post author), i doubt they will pursue you and get a court order based on such possibility that some IP connected certain honeypot at similar time when some post was published on certain darknet - seems a unrealistic - i was told by the police investigator that they are getting court order to go into your home and take computer only in serious cases like murder, terrorism. In my country police is not allowed to do this - to proactively research/hunt for possible law violators. + even if they get to your home/office, there can be multiple computers and these can also be encrypted. And also how they can prove who was sitting behind the computer at a time of a violation.

Btw. i read interesting info. about ZFS filesystem, but possibly it is too complicate Linux thingy and more simple is to create normal RAM disk.\n\nZFS:\n> \"In a ZFS raid, sequential performance scale with number of data disks so a few disks can give a sequential performance good for a 10G network. For a random read/write workload where SSDs are much faster, ZFS use its superiour rambased read/write caches (blockbased not filebased with a read most/ read last strategy on reads). It is quite usual to have a read hit rate from cache over 80%. This is why you see ZFS storage systems with > 100 GB RAM.\n>Additionally you can extend the rambased readcache Arc with an SSD or NVMe readcache L2Arc (max 10 x RAM) where you can additionally enable read ahead what can improve some sequiental workloads.\"",
