Like the stupid thing Musk sold to the idiots who worship him. A butane torch essentially, used for roofing and killing weeds. \n\nWhat this guy has linked is an actual flamethrower.\nIt doesn't fire \"flame\" it sprays flammable liquid fuel which is ignited. \nOnce the fuel lands on something it continues to burn. To get an idea of how this would go, pour some petrol (gasoline to you yanks) on yourself now imagine its all burning.\nNot that flamethrowers use vehicle fuel generally. The preference here is for something more viscous that sticks to its target. \n\n",

Since its hard to keep children on script generally.\n\nAnyways.\nI think theres two real dangerous elements to what they're using her to push.\n\nFirst is food. They're trying to dramatically alter human diet. When you look at what they're pushing (vegan diets/insect protein) you quickly realise that this would cause considerable malnourishment among the general populace.\nEven accounting for the protein sources that are available in this scenario, not all protein is created equal. And we'd be missing out on a host of other essential nutritional elements that would result in most of humanity becoming a lot dumber and weaker. \n\nHigh quality nutrition is a requirement for the creation of high quality humans. You can't cut corners here and meat has to be a hefty part of that intake. \nSo it's no shock the upper classes want to limit nutrition quality for the masses. Makes them easier to control and less able to understand what is going on around them. If you want an example just look at the lower classes in our society who rely heavily on processed foods and fast food.\n\nThe second danger is the push for travel limitation.\n\nMass air travel especially has been the great equaliser in terms of travel. \nIt has enabled the majority of the species to become able to travel the world increasing the capacity for communication between parts of the world. If you manage to control the internet and prevent the spread of wrongthink that way then you must inevitably also target mass travel as this will be the other way for wrongthink to spread.\n\nThere is also the added bonus that the more you limit travel the more captive a regions workforce is thus allowing you to more heavily exploit them. \n\nBut perhaps most sinister of all is that a population who are in effect imprisoned in one area have little idea what is going on outside their corner of the world. Relying on media to tell them.\nThis would allow you to create a world with dramatically different standards of living without anyone except those at the top really realising. \nThe majority of the population would live in a world of their own, ignorant of what goes on outside of it, forbidden from traveling to learn the truth and fed lies of the wider world by the media.\n\nThis Greta girl is but the latest in a long line of tricks used to try and push us towards this future. \nAn outright return to feudalism.",
