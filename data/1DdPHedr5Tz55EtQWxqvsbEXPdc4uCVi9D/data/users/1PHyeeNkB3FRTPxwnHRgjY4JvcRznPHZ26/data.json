It's methodology and tactics to subvert AI through things like stenography. \n\nFor example, Butterfly War could be loosely summarized as pretending to have the wing patterns (ala Viceroy Butterflies pretending to be the poisonous Monarch Butterflies) of protected classes (read: niggers, women, etc.) by fooling the AI that tech companies like Google et. al. are illegally employing to determine who's black and who's a woman on the internet so that they end up associating natsoc/related /pol/ characteristics with protected classes, destroying their ability to differentiate and censor specific groups. It's all bloody complicated and I need to study data science more.\n\nIn all likelihood, this board won't be any actual use, I suppose, moreso because I lost the user key for it and now I can't modify it, but if even just you took the time to poke through his work and determine for yourself if it holds merit, I feel it was worth it. I think Cultstate is a genius and I don't make that kind of statement lightly.",
