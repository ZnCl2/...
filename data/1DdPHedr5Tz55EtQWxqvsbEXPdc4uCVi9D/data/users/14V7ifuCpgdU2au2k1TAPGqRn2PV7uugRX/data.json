In every civil war there are clear cut sides; there can be several different factions, but they're organized groups with a somewhat cohesive set of goals and beliefs. We anons are lacking that, and since none of us are actually willing to form together and start an organized militia (mostly because of cia niggers and geographical factors such as distance), the only real attacks are just going to be lone wolves attacking a mosque/synagogue every now and then which do jackshit in the big picture. Unless we organize into an actual, physical group, there will be no uprising. That's just the way it is.",

If no moderation is done on your board for two weeks and your board's reports are not being taken care of, your board may be restricted regardless of your account's login activity as Board Owner.\n\n>What happens when a board is restricted?\n>On 8kun, before deleting, blocking, or banning a board, the 8kun Administrator may choose to restrict it as a warning. On a restricted board, users are not able to post or view images, post through Tor, or link to other websites. Furthermore, the board is unindexed and CAPTCHA per post is enabled. This restricted status may or may not be removed later, at the discretion of the 8kun administration.\n\n>What is read-only mode?\n>On 8kun, specific boards or the entire website will be set to read-only mode in the event of an emergency, including, but not limited to, posts that announce imminent lawless action that is ultimately consummated. When read-only mode is enabled, users will be unable to post.\n\nas I predicted, the censoring has begun\nwhen the site gets put in read-only mode, always remember to come back here",
