Fucking. Cares. Let them eat their fucking slop, I've got a backlog that is damn near bottomless, and solid titles still come out every now and then. I don't really think 8ch had that much influence to begin with, but if you absolutely have to have an impact, fuck it, nothing is stopping any of us from organizing a raid now. Seriously, it's been meme'd before but now this site is absolutely the Umman Manda, they can do precisely dick to punish any sort of fuckery launched from here.\n\n>...this is basically the first step of complete and total control of the internet.\nThe already control the \"old\" net, they'll never control the new shit. Enjoy looking down from your ivory tower at the fucking normal-niggers that can't even install adblock without being arrested.\n\n>This is going to be a painful 10,000 years.\nOh yeah, its gonna be fucking agonizing for everyone, but us. We're all out, keep it that way and you'll be fine\n\nThis is not the time for the black pill, even if they somehow take this place from me too I know theres still infinite alternatives out there. We are talking literally INFINITE chan. Fuck fahrenheit 451, this is the book that cannot be burnt no matter how many lemmings petition their masters to do so.\n\nGood pep talk, I'm gonna go jerk off to fat fucking tits now.",
