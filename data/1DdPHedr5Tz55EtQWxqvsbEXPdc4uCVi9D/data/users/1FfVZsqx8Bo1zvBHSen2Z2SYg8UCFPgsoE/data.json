Rebuild and then reload 08chan database.\n\nFinally you can try move your currently 08chan folder\n 1DdPHedr5Tz55EtQWxqvsbEXPdc4uCVi9D\nand start with clean 08chan from scratch to test it. \n\nDo you see at least half from Synchronite trackers? At least 20? Is number green? Do you use python3 zeronet version already?",

I see crazy large 900 MB files and distribute it with tor through 6 pc (between two random users) with 10 min circuits reset (tor default connections life cycle) is beyond sane mind. \n\nLet' s face it with tor you can't distributed big files, it's not made for p2p service, you have to use VPN. Question is if you trust VPN services. \n\nWith small files zeronet + tor works. \n\nSolution can be dividing big files to small parts (with 7zip, rar, on total commander) so users download all parts and merge them on their pc. \n\n\"Had one zite which was deleting files (trying) for weeks. Almost nothing else would get processed, and I see this as a \"bug\" within the ZeroNet model. It's almost like a DDOS attack.\"\n\nThe zite had big files, right? Bigger than 10 - 15 MB.",
