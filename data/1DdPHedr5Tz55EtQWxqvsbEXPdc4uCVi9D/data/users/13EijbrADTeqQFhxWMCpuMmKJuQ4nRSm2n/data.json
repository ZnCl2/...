The main way to do this is by asking the user to find crack a hash.\n- There are two main brands of PoW hashes: those designed to require a GPU to use (because they'd be unbearably slow on a CPU) and those designed to reduce the advantage a GPU has when computing it.\n- If you use a CPU based one then everyone could compute a hash in a reasonable amount of time.\n- If you use a GPU based one (like the one used in Bitcoin) then some people with weak GPUs couldn't.

So it makes sense that we began to be monitored early on.\nAlso, you forgot to include some of the juiciest bits.\n>ZeroNet works the same way, a fact that’s been much-discussed on the new site. For that reason, ZeroNet integrates tightly with Tor, an anonymity system that places layers of cut-out addresses between a user and the websites they visit. But only 41 percent of 08chan’s users’ are using Tor, based on our analysis of the peer-to-peer traffic at the site.\n>Users on 08chan have been complaining that the site is buggy and slow over Tor, and the site’s own administrator initially encouraged anons to just connect directly. “Feel free to post without Tor,” he wrote in a welcome message. “Even as the admin I have no power to identify anyone.”\n>Though an IP address alone doesn’t identify the person behind it, it can nonetheless be telling, particularly when a user is running websites or other services off the same IP, as dozens in our sample were.

The site then becomes an unusable javascript mess.\nThe difference in single core performance is different  by a factor of at most 4 or 5 times between the slowest shitbox being able to browse here and top of the line. The problem then becomes preventing parallelism for generating a single ID (which is important also to remove a GPU's advantage, since an average GPU has like 5 code fetching units IIRC that are conceptually equivalent to a CPU core each, and goes up into the dozens per chip).\nI think there are algorithms designed for that, though. In any case I don't think PoW alone is a better solution than ZeroID. It'd only be more useful when combined with everything else.\nIn any case, you can always set up a hidden service website that upon completing a captcha does the PoW challenge for you and gives you the cert to install it on your machine.",

It means if at least one of the nodes in your route is actually anonymizing traffic (aka doesn't keep logs and give them to the authorities) then you are anonymous (for the most part, correlation attacks and all that).\n>I dont trust the tor network at all\nThat's fine, I don't either. I just trust it more than corporate entities promising not to sell my data or give it away to the FBI to avoid legal pressure from the FBI and the associated lawyer fees.\n>and ive found it to be completely redundant in any case.\nWhy?\n>The only point of failure here is your VPN provider\nIn your setup? Maybe (ignoring that most VPN clients leak data by default to the clearnet).\nBut then again I could say that in Tor the only point of failure is the Tor network. And I trust it more than I do some random company.\n>you can run all of your internet activity on Tails if you want, but youre wasting your time.\nI don't go that far, and you don't need to either. I won't disclose my OS unnecessarily, but I don't use Tails.\n>A lot of this isnt necessarily applicable to zeronet either due to the way zeronet works, this is a general browsing guide for the most part. \nVPNs are useless for general browsing as well as for ZeroNet.\n>I would not trust zeronet on Tor if i didnt have a VPN behind it, and I dont trust TOR to begin with\nYou can trust ZeroNet to give away your IP when using without Tor. It's just the way it works. In fact ZeroNet lowers Tor's effectiveness when using it with it because of patterns in the availability of data packets, but for the most part that's unavoidable in p2p networks.",

If it's the later it could be patched to allow whitelisting, if not then I guess not.\n>Not so fast. You can't get get a zeroid with arbitrary auth_address (the world would burn down in a chaos in 5 minutes if you'd find a way to do it) and since they're used as user id's in millchan, you don't want to change them either.\n>I didn't intend to do it as a js change, just put the modified files into my zeronet client and let it distribute. The other clients would accept them since they have a valid signature.\nYou mean create a new CA that can sign already existing auth_address? Is auth_address the same as the user address (what's in the user folder names)?\nWhat files in particular would you modify to get the clients to recognize this new CA authority as valid? Isn't that baked into ZeroNet? Or does the API allow you to make it recognize new ones?\nWith js you could move every user's file into the same ZeroID folder, and then combine all the data.json files into one, and create a content.json for it. Would probably take less than one minute to run the script. Then anyone that already has the files will seed them as if they were from the very beginning.\nOf course there are some problems with this approach, mainly blacklisting killing everything since everything would be posted by the same user.",

			"body": "== /ALPR/ GENERAL 0.2 (zeronet mirror) ==\nI created a thread on /cy/ as well, mistaking the single users multiple posts as organic content. I can maintain two threads I think. We'll see. I'll be posting proposes solutions here as well.\n\n<LET'S DO SOME INFOSEC WORK SHAZBOTS\n\nThis is a new series I am going to make based on the products collectively known as Automatic License Plate Readers (aka ALPRs). There is a lot of mystery and myth surrounding this technology as well as methods of effectively evading it, if any exist at all. Collectively I am confident we can find a solution to the Automated threat\n\n>inb4 if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear\n\nFuck you.\n\n>What is it?\n\n\"Typically, ALPR systems are comprised of high-speed cameras connected to computers that photograph every license plate that passes. The photo is converted to letters and numbers, which are attached to a time and location stamp, then uploaded to a central server. This allows police to identify and record the locations of vehicles in real time and also identify where those vehicles have been in the past. Using this information, police could establish driving patterns for individual cars. The type of data ALPRs collect, analyze, and access often depends on what kind of systems they use and how they combine the data.\"\n\nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/four-flavors-automated-license-plate-reader-technology\n\n( https://web.archive.org/web/20190705211401/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/04/four-flavors-automated-license-plate-reader-technology )\n\n>Why the concern?\n\nMuch like Stringrays (cell towerspoofing MITM devices used by LEO) a few years back, these devices are essentially unregulated. When used by private parties have been they have been able to scan up to 8k license plates in a single day, according to only one study. These databases are up for sale, much like cell location data. The data recorded includes GPS location, scan coordinates, and timestamp. When factoring in this information and without even the consideration of data breaches this clearly becomes an issue to everyone's privacy.\n\nhttps://www.popsci.com/article/technology/scan-artist/\n\n( https://web.archive.org/web/20190616105746/https://www.popsci.com/article/technology/scan-artist/ )\n\n>Okay shazbot, what can we do about it?\n\nI'm not sure yet, that's what I'm hoping our collective effort can discover. Below I will list some of the methods tried, there viability, cost, and feasibility.\n\nTemplate Pastebin:\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/u0xaeu9P",
