You and I face a threat like no other faced before in human history, but do not give up, black-pill-san. \n\nWhen our founding fathers challenged the Britbongs, they must have felt similarly powerless. They were up against a nation which had half the world in its grasp. What hope did a small upstart revolutionary force have? \nI'll tell you what they had. Ambition, justice, and truth on their side - all 3 things our enemies lack. \n\nAmericans have a lot to thank these brave men for, and similarly a lot to apologize for. The laws put in place have reduced what America was built to be. \n\nIt shall be born again, but know that there will be much sweat, tears, and blood left to be spilled before the tree of liberty can once again take root.
