Everyone saw how shit moderation became on /pol/ under imkampfy and arguably for entirely different reasons still shit after globals took over.  Yet despite multiple alternatives existing none ever attained much volume.  You can say that all alternatives were shit but that would have still left the opportunity to create a good one and yet that never happened either.  This is not to say that I am that concerned about the site admin at the moment as all sites carry such risk, instead I'm just saying that mass exoduses are not so easily done even when its simple to create alternatives.",
