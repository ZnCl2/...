I prefer it to Mark's bunker, mostly because of the decentralised nature, but it's a bitch to work and it slowly consumes memory like fucking browser Alzheimers and if it's slow it's hard to encourage people unless they have to be here out of desperation.\nI'd have bailed completely if I didn't think it was a fundamentally good idea, but I still have fuck and all to say.",

I've only really been keeping tabs on this and vch, because I don't trust any of the other bunkers and Mark's at least a known-enough faggot. Frankly, I'm kind of not expecting anything from 8kun, shitty name aside. It'll be flooded with shit and I really don't understand why the goblin's still so bent out of shape over... having a copy of a shooter's fucking manifesto, at the end of the day. But I don't understand why people want to suckle at the teat of media for their fifteen seconds of fleeting fame. I just want to be left alone.",
