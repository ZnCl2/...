I created a clone of millchan since they had the most proven build of the Nullchan framework, and then added a bunch of bugfixes and a couple hacks based on Nullchan's original code.  Everything was tested and working fine at that point, though I seemed to miss the \"blank files uploading from TOR\" bug.  About two months after I did this, Millchan completely revamped their site.\n\nI can update the cloned code using Zeronet's functionality, but I get a warning that it will overwrite any custom code that I have implemented.  I never did it since the site was working fine and I was rather afraid of the process breaking everything and going to hell.  Stability was my number one priority.  (imagine the chaos right now if I did the update and it suddenly broke everything).\n\nI can, and will do the update if its really necessary, but there are risks.",

You don't take chances with experimental stuff when you're making an apocalypse bunker, and imageboards using Zeronet had already been created.

The core code of the site was indeed cloned from Millchan (because it was the most stable of the Zeronet imageboards), but several bugfixes and a few hacks based on the original Nullchan code were applied to it to create 08chan.\n\nA couple months after this was done, Millchan did a complete redesign of their site.  This place was already working perfectly in every test I and some anons performed, so we opted for \"if it isn't broken, don't try to fix it.\"  For instance, we've already had some anons testing the new Millchan who say the [M] function doesn't always delete everything its supposed to, where ours does.\n\nI think its someone who wants to drive some of our traffic to Millchan's community, but that's conjecture on my part.  I have no ill will to the Millchan peeps, but 08chan is 08chan.  We're our own thing.",

I'm sure everyone is following the happenings with 8chan, but the current score is that Bitmitigate got deplatformed by their own service providers, and Ron and the other 8chan staff are working on an alternative.  In the meantime, a whole shitload of people came here - exactly what 08chan is for.\n\n==Known Issues==\n\n>Image uploading via TOR is currently broken.  A temp fix for thumbnails was found, but there is a permanent solution to be found in upgrading 08chan's base code.  This must be done very carefully to not cripple the site, and some anons from /tech/ are experimenting with it.\n\n>~~If we're here for more than a few days, we will start implementing quality of life improvements and code upgrades.~~  It seems we're going to be stuck here for a while so we're going to move forward with this.\n\n>The Mute function has been working fine since the time of the last tests.  To Unmute a user, go to ZeroHello and access the large \"3 vertical dots\" menu in the upper left corner, and choose \"Manage Blocked Users\".  Feel free to test the Mute functionality and make sure it is working properly.  Report bugs here.\n\n>Zeronet as a whole is not fully compatible with certain browsers like Opera, and there's nothing we can do about that.  I'm sorry.\n\n>Script blockers can have a terrible effect on basic site functions.  Make sure you whitelist the site in Noscript and other systems.\n\n>Gab launched a Tweetchain about this site in the early hours of August 6th, which exploded on Twitter.  Site traffic is currently ramping up by the hour.  If the site is slowing down for you, consider enabling the \"Download and Help Distribute All Files\" option in your 0 menu with a limit of 500mb and a file size limit of 20mb.  This will speed the site back up to its normal rate at the cost of some disk space.\n\n==IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU POST AND BROWSE ONLY VIA TOR OR A VPN.==\nThe Daily Beast published a hitpiece about us today that revealed (((certain people))) are harvesting IPs from concurrent connections for purposes unknown. \n\n==THE SITE NOW REQUIRES A ZEROID CERTIFICATE TO POST==\nThis ID can be acquired by using ZeroNet over the clearnet just long enough to visit \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/ \nThis will give you a new, one-time certificate so you can post.  To activate it, get the cert and then open the \"0\" menu in the upper right, and select Change next to \"Identity Address.\"  Choose the ZeroID cert.  Update the site, reload the page and be patient and you should be able to post again.  We are attempting a fix to allow new users to access old content from before this change.\n\n>It is possible to run all of ZeroNet from inside a Veracrypt Encrypted File Container.  I strongly recommend making such a container and only mounting it during the times you are using ZeroNet, and unmounting it when you finish.  This is slightly RAM-intensive, so it may not be an option if you have a toaster, but will give you maximum personal protection if you inadvertently download something you shouldn't have.\n\n==I HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED A BUG IN THE [M] FUNCTION.==\n\n If you mute a user who has a very large number of files in your cache, and/or you have files from that user open in other tabs, the system may not offer you the prompt \"this will delete all of this users files\" and instead only ask if you want to mute them.  If you choose yes they will be muted but the files will NOT be deleted.  If this happens, make a note of the first 5 characters of their ID hash from the Mute message and go into your Zeronet folder, the 1DdPH... folder, /data/users and ctrl+f for those 5 characters.  Shift-rightclick their folder and hit delete and scrub the files manually.\n\nWe've had no other bug reports apart from the slowness caused by so many leechers, but I found this a bit ago when I muted a porn spammer on /b/ as a test.  His folder had over 1000 files in it between thumbnails and images from a single thread.  We will investigate this bug as well.",

I'm sure everyone is following the happenings with 8chan, but the current score is that Bitmitigate got deplatformed by their own service providers, and Ron and the other 8chan staff are working on an alternative.  In the meantime, a whole shitload of people came here - exactly what 08chan is for.\n\n==Known Issues==\n\n==Posting errors between ZeroID certs and old 08chan certs should be fixed now.  If you get an error that your post size is more than 0 bites, delete Zeronet and start with a fresh install.  Get a new ZeroID from a clean IP address, and everything should work fine.==\n\n>~~If we're here for more than a few days, we will start implementing quality of life improvements and code upgrades.  It seems we're going to be stuck here for a while so we're going to move forward with this.~~ First major update has been applied.\n\n>The Mute function has been working fine since the time of the last tests.  To Unmute a user, go to ZeroHello and access the large \"3 vertical dots\" menu in the upper left corner, and choose \"Manage Blocked Users\".  Feel free to test the Mute functionality and make sure it is working properly.  Report bugs here.\n\n>Zeronet as a whole is not fully compatible with certain browsers like Opera, and there's nothing we can do about that.  I'm sorry.\n\n>Script blockers can have a terrible effect on basic site functions.  Make sure you whitelist the site in Noscript and other systems.\n\n>Gab launched a Tweetchain about this site in the early hours of August 6th, which exploded on Twitter.  Site traffic is currently ramping up by the hour.  If the site is slowing down for you, consider enabling the \"Download and Help Distribute All Files\" option in your 0 menu with a limit of 500mb and a file size limit of 20mb.  This will speed the site back up to its normal rate at the cost of some disk space.\n\n==IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU POST AND BROWSE ONLY VIA TOR OR A VPN.==\nThe Daily Beast published a hitpiece about us On August 10th that revealed (((certain people))) are harvesting IPs from concurrent connections for purposes unknown. \n\n==THE SITE NOW REQUIRES A ZEROID CERTIFICATE TO POST==\nThis ID can be acquired by using ZeroNet over the clearnet just long enough to visit \nhttp://127.0.0.1:43110/1iD5ZQJMNXu43w1qLB8sfdHVKppVMduGz/ \nThis will give you a new, one-time certificate so you can post.  To activate it, get the cert and then open the \"0\" menu in the upper right, and select Change next to \"Identity Address.\"  Choose the ZeroID cert.  Update the site, reload the page and be patient and you should be able to post again.  \n\n==It is possible to run all of ZeroNet from inside a Veracrypt Encrypted File Container. ==\nI strongly recommend making such a container and only mounting it during the times you are using ZeroNet, and unmounting it when you finish.  This is slightly RAM-intensive, so it may not be an option if you have a toaster, but will give you maximum personal protection if you inadvertently download something you shouldn't have.\n\n==I HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED A BUG IN THE [M] FUNCTION.==\n\n If you mute a user who has a very large number of files in your cache, and/or you have files from that user open in other tabs, the system may not offer you the prompt \"this will delete all of this users files\" and instead only ask if you want to mute them.  If you choose yes they will be muted but the files will NOT be deleted.  If this happens, make a note of the first 5 characters of their ID hash from the Mute message and go into your Zeronet folder, the 1DdPH... folder, /data/users and ctrl+f for those 5 characters.  Shift-rightclick their folder and hit delete and scrub the files manually.\n\nNew thread for people with toasters and/or the old thread got too big.",

I had to stop using it because opening a large thread on Fullchan would cause it to freeze up back in the day.  Sound familiar?  It says right in the announcement that not all browsers are supported ''by ZeroNet'', which includes the implementations of it used to make this place and Millchan.  I'm genuinely happy that you got it figured out, but  Experimental Darknet 8chan is going to have its quirks and issues.  Some of them we're going to be able to fix for you, some will get fixed when Millchan updates the core code (since nobody knows their system better than the people who made it), and some like less-popular browser compatibility may never get fixed.",

			"body": "Honestly I've been doing some thinking and a few ideas have come to mind:\n\nThere are several ZeroNet sites that have \"portals\" on the clearnet.  Basically ZeroNet proxies that let people browse a ZN site from the clearnet without downloading any files.  If we established such a proxy we could ask that it be added to the 8chan bunker webring, and that would let anons stay in touch with us here and drive traffic.  The proxy would need to be configured to mitigate spam/CP risk, something like deleting its entire file cache every few hours and starting over, plus the highest security settings (like \"spoiler all\" and \"always spoiler\").  You know fuckers would abuse it otherwise.\n\nAnother option would be a bundle installer.  A single file that would installVeracrypt, ZeroNet, TOR browser, and a basic set of 08chan's files, and then configure everything for you via a simple script.  \n\nAlternatively, there is a ZeroNet app for Android that seems to work quite well.  We could encourage phonefags to spread awareness of it and make use of it.",

I haven't caught up all the details yet because of the avalanche of he-said-she-said going on, but the gist of it seems to be as follows:\n\n>8kun site has been having problems, and Jim and Ron have been backburnering the site and dragging their feet fixing things in favor of a sort of \"Infinity Next\" generation upgrade to the overall code.\n>They have kept users largely in the dark about this, so complaints have been mounting.\n>Markjew, the BO of /v/, brought the issue to a head with Jim Watkins and several things came out of it.\n>Jim apparently doesn't care about /v/, or perhaps any of the boards apart from the policed news boards and the Qboomers.\n>Jim considers 2D loli to be the same as CP.  A few here might agree with this in principle but its also setting off the free speech canary warnings sitewide.  Censorship always starts somewhere and its the low-hanging fruit.\n>Jim's justification was to get on friendly terms with local media because 8kun exists \"to sell advertising to customers.\"\n>When /v/'s BO pressed the issue harder he was summarily fired and lost ownership of his board.  In retaliation he began dumping his private conversations with the 8kun admins to back up his claims.\n>Other BOs took note of this and the drama intensified.  Bunkers are being activated and there's talk of a mass exodus.\n\n8chan's revival may be far more short lived than we might have hoped for.  For my part I check in on this place weekly to download the latest files and seed the master back to our network nodes.  Several half-started backburner projects for this place still exist, and those may be reactivated if we see an influx of activity, including a clearnet portal with anonymous posting.",

The other is a WAN architecture to allow a clearnet landing site to funnel users to a specific tor hidden service running on a different, concealed machine.  This could allow the clearnet site and its server and domain to have full deniability against takedowns and deplatforming (as they host no content, objectionable or otherwise) while also avoiding the tracking and datamining problems that are plentiful with tor open proxies.  If both of these work out, then next it should also be possible to clone ZeroID's system to have our own, in-house cert generation too.  That's been a long term goal ever since the spam attack.\n\nI know I only post rarely, but I do bring up the main seed and update my files every couple of weeks.  This place is in no way abandoned.  The fact is, 08 doesn't need me.  If it did, ''then'' it would be a failure.",
