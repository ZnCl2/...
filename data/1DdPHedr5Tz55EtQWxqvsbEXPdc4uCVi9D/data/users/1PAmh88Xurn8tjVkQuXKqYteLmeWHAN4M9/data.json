			"body": "How come it's so hard to find good cooking games? Even the ones that get the cooking part right mess up the second half - making and customizing your restaurant/kitchen/hobo den. I've been enthralled by these kinds of games since I was a child, but they're so niche that I barely notice anything decent on my radar. Have you guys found anything that properly simulates the full cooking experience?",
