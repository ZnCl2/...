First of all, there was nothing wrong with the Allies \"winning\" the war, but the problem stemmed from the war '''stopping''' with the conquering of Germany. If the Kikes and FDR hadn't assassinated Patton, the war would have carried on to fighting the USSR and we wouldn't have had much of the corruption that has screwed up society for the past 74 years. To get a much earlier point out of the way, the U.S. should '''NEVER''' have gotten involved in the war in the first place. It was a '''European''' problem for '''Europeans''' to solve, we should have had nothing to do with it. The only reason why we ''DID'' get involved is because of \"His Royal Highness, Franklin Roosevelt\" didn't want people remember that he was one that screwed up the country beyond all repair, and he didn't it to such an extent that he had to resort to illegal actions in order to stay in office (**This was before Presidential term limits, and people point to him as the reason why they were first instituted**). If it wasn't for the fact that much of the country was focused on more important things, like food and a roof over their heads, we never would have gotten involved. As for a final easy point to get out of the way, Hitler never should have invaded Poland. According to every single source that I had found, Nazi Germany was actually one of the '''least''' “Anti-Sematic” countries during the 1930's.
