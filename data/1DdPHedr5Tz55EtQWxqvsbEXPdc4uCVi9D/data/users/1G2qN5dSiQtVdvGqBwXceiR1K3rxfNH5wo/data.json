The top button on HelloZero does not show a warning as it does when you access outside of tor browser (with chrome etc).  The reason that ZeroNet recommends using Tor browser is because of the hardening that has already been done, things that are blocked - things which are enabled by default for your other browsers.\n\nYou can for sure make your own package out of this.  You can use imdisk to make a new .img file.  You would simply replace the ramdisk.img file in the folder with the new image you generate.  Everything else is batch scripts, so you can see what is going on and modify to suit.\n\nI wanted something that was tor end to end, preconfigured, I wanted new certs at every launch, and I sure as hell didn't want it stored (even temporarily) on media which was friendly to forensic recovery.  \n\nHopefully someone else will find some use from this.  It's not obvious that ZeroNet isn't configured to use Tor out of the gate.  \"normie\" and paranoia friendly I guess you could say.",

Create 2gb ramdrive and make sure it's in RAM (not swap) and changes aren't persisted after reboots\n\n2. Format\n\n3. Install tor and zeronet on the device\n\n4. Use dd to image it\n\n5. Create a script to create the ramdrive and restore the dd image and another script to kill it (or just rely on a reboot)",

It could be beneficial resource wise, but tbh I don't mind one \"Tor ID\" for zeronet and a different \"Tor ID\" for the browser I'm using.  No way to tie what I'm doing in the browser back to what I'm using for Zeronet this way.",
