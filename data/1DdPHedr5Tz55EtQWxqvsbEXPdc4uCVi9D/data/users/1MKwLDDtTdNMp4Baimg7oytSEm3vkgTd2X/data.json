Very few people making these games know what a truly apolitical game looks like, they're all trying to backpedal into an safe zone of \"apoliticism\" (read: politics, but only good goy politics) where the gameplay is the only thing that matters. They don't realise that there is no safe zone there, never was a safe zone there, because anything left of (((Trotsky))) is offensive now. And even if they do manage to make a game leftist enough they're only driving the bar further left for everyone after them.\nThe best way to make an apolitical game now is to make game, then tell marxist niggerkikes to go fuck themselves.

Point to where the same thing occured in any Aryan religion.\n>The core is philosophical and logical in the strict sense of the words\nAnd that logic and philosophy is degenerate universalist slave morality, though. Like communism, it gains followers by promising equality for all, and brings everyone down to lower than they were before it.\n>But understand that the philosophical foundation of both Greco-Roman and norse mythology is egotism, which naturally leads to solipsism.\nHow so? In Greco-Roman and Norse mythology, man was not an individual, but a member of a people. People had social roles and responsibilities, such as the pater familias leading the rites of the family, and gods representing social bonds such as these were worshipped. Only under Christianity did Western society degenerate into individualist and solipsist philosophy, these things did not come from the ancient times.\n>Where as Christianity is the culmination of stoicism, empiricism, asceticism, and objectivity\n>Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century CE, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century CE. t. wikipedia\nEmpiricism would necessarily demand a god that could be reached and felt. The Romans justified this with every battle they won by rite of devotio, the Norsemen believed likewise that they did not win only through strength, but through a force greater than themselves. Christianity has no such teachings about the presence of their God in men's lives, for all the tales told in the Bible about the manifestations of the Holy Spirit. Other than that, there have been reported sightings of Mary, always of course unverifiable and therefore unempirical.\nAsceticism cannot happen in a religion which preaches against war, for war is the greatest form of anti-material asceticism.\nObjectivity doesn't happen either, since by claiming the Christian God is objective without first proving his existence without error, one necessarily takes a subjective point of view upon other ideas.\n>These ideas are the tools by which one best achieves not only individual, but also societal potential.\nThen why has Western society only gotten more and more degenerate since they were introduced?\n>inb4 b-but muh jews, they're totally detached from christianity despite us taking most of our religion from the mouth of a jew and still believing in semitic ideas\n>there were no christian wars of conquest\n(X) Doubt\nEdit:\n>the ideas themselves were strong enough to conquer the world.\nSo is judeo-capitalism a good ideology, because it \"conquered the world\" then? Degenerate shit is easy to sell. Progressivism, communism, Christianity attracted people because all of these things appeal to the numerous weak, telling them that their weakness is no fault of their own and if they follow this prophet they will be equal to their betters. Communism blames the bourgeoisie, progressivism blames white men, Christianity blames the original sin of Adam and Eve. Communism says that equality can be achieved by tearing down the bourgeoisie and living by sharing all resources, progressivism says it can be achieved by getting rid of white men, and then refuses to say any more. Christianity says it can be achieved by following the bible and living your life by its slave morality.\nContrast the ideas of pagans from before this degeneration. You are a human, we are gods, you can share in our power if only you fight well enough to earn it. Yours is the power to be a hero, and the gods cannot but favour heroes. Live without fear, for Valhalla awaits you when you die in glory.\nIt's no wonder weak semites would try to (((shut it down.))) Holding a heroic philosophy like this needs strength, it requires you to improve yourself rather than to drag everyone else down. Given the current popularity of philosophies of equality instead of philosophies of heroism, I'm sure you can see how Christianity \"conquered the world.\"",

The faith acknowledges that we're all different, or else to make such a distinction would betray the notion.

If he wants his creation to have freedom, he then must not be omnipotent, he must deny himself even the ability to intervene. But the Bible says he is. Does he then not desire his creation's freedom from his own intervention? And if he wants freedom, then why does he also want people to believe in him? If he wants only a certain type of belief why doesn't he just change reality to give everyone that type of belief?

At least one sect of Judaism reveres as holy the day on which its founding rabbi escaped the hall of cost.\n>Why are you conflating jewish inventions with christian ones?\nBecause Christianity is a jewish invention and therefore anything European attributed to it is at best a creative misinterpretation of holy text?\n>Unlike the holohoax, I don't have anything to gain from debating you like this.\nThen why did you start, let alone continue?\n>Paul should be a hint that you aren't the first edgy boy to hate on the cross.\nwtf i love rabbi yeshua bar yosef now!\n>Many allusions to warfighting are made in the new testament. Jesus is said to bring a sword to the world, He himself made a weapon to chase the merchants from the temple, instructed his disciples to purchase swords, and only reprimanded peter against using the sword first.\nWhere does \"turn the other cheek\" and \"carry a pack two miles instead of one\" come into that then? Is there a contradiction in a supposedly divine text?\n>Not only that, but contextual exegesis of the gospel is where the christian concepts of self defense and war comes from.\nSo a misinterpretation then.\n>The concept of \"Just War\" is wholly a Christian one, stemming from the 5th century and evolving ever since.\nThen where has it been attested in the Bible? Please cease the larping.\n>Technically, the conditions for such have been met for 70 years now, but it should go to show you just how far these jews go in suppressing the true faith from being practice.\nOnly 70? There have been jews in Europe for hundreds of years now, and before that there were their spiritual brothers the Christians.\nAnd in all this, none of it ever addressed the essential point. Read Metaphysics of War by Julius Evola, or Ride the Tiger if you want a more general philosophy. Evola knew a lot about true European spirituality.\nEdit: splitting this into two posts.",

He has nothing stopping him from getting it, by definition, not even consequences such as faith becoming entrapment because he can take them away, so having must be the same as desiring. The alternative would be to disbelieve in his omnipotence and deny the bible, or to believe in some system of logic which says god can want something but not want it (for itself) at the same time.\n>We don't even know the names of all the jewish families who are trying to finance our demise today, with the power of the internet and cooperation. Yet somehow you think this would be an easier feat centuries ago.\nGiven that Jews have only achieved widespread and blatant financial power in the last 500 or so years, and before that they were restricted in their settlement and generally held accountable for their actions, I'd say it was the Christian subversion of Europe that prepared them to let Jews in. Just like Jews in Spain let Muslims in, Semites work together.\n>Olaf was a norse convert who chose to do that to his own people\nNice goalpost move, nerd. Olaf was a Christian conducting war against pagans, which is what you said there were none of. And the Crusades were against European peasants, not armed fighters. Just concede the point, no amount of pilpul can cover up truth.",
