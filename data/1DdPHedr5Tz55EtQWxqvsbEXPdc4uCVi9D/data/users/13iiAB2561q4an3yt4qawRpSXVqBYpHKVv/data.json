He has the kind of writing style that keeps me engaged too.\n>>c886ccac-9db3-4aa5-b064-32367d6775ea\nAny of Jones' tomes are great sources of information. Haven't read TJRS yet but it's on my list. I'd also recommend Jones' Libido Dominandi. He's obviously done a ton of research into modern jewery but he's still a christcuck. In Libido Dominandi he has a chapter about how \"nazis are the real homosexuals.\" It cites The Pink Swastika, which is full of shit from (((Hirschfeld))), one of the enemies of the NSDAP in the Wiemar days. I wish he'd admit that the NSDAP shared a lot of his beliefs, but no, \"nazis were the bad guys, m'kay.\" Anyways, he's done a ton of research and his material can make some powerful rhetoric if used properly.\n>>6c2b5c63-8899-4733-9dfa-f399882dbae8\nOP, I'd suggest E. Michael Jones if you're looking for historical accounts of jews degenerating society and McDonald if you're looking into jewish behavior and strategy. I'd also suggest 200 years together by Solzhenitsyn if you want a great book on how the jews completely fucked Russia.",
