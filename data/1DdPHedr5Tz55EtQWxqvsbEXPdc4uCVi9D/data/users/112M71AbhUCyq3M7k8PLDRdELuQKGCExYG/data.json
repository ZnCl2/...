So if you force the users to create an ID, you have the same problems as if you host the website on the normienet. But you need something like that in order to control who is posting on the site, just like a captcha would always be centralised (if it wouldn't, a bot could just verify his own captchas).\n\nThe next problem is that i don't have as much control over the content that i seed than i would like to.\nWe need as many possibilities to filter content as possible, to deal with spam and to deal with the infinite growing diskspace that ZeroNet uses. Filter by keyword, filter by RegExp, bayesian filter (whats used by mail spam-filters), fiter by user, filter by date, filter by age of user, all  for new content and for deleting already saved content. And then shared filter lists, just like uBlock has ad-filterlists.\n\nAnd it needs a good easily accessable interface for browsing through whats saved. People were surprised here that everybody can see their posting history if they just wade through the folders and check out the users content.json. Users should know this since the very beginning, providing a nice interface to whats saved from what user and whats seeded should be the most important part of the whole platform.\n\nMost of those things need to be solved in ZeroNet itself. It just feels like nobody ever asked the question:\n>hmm, what happens if someone just floods some zite with 10000 messages?\n\nKnowing that every autist with enough dedication could flood this board (and every single other ZeroNet site) with 1000 messages from permanently new created IDs is very demotivating.",

But seeing how limited the current CAs are, it most likely means huge changes that aren't backwards compatible.\nAnd that means lots of time till anything comes out of it... but it really has to be done, i do not see the point in ZeroNet without it.\n\nMaybe i will join you.
