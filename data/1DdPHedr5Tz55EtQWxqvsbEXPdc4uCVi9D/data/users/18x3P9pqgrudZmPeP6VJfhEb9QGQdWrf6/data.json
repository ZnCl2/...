			"body": "Generally speaking I like anything that makes people think about their security and their online footprint. I think the more people start to become familiar with tools like Tor or even a VPN, it helps keep the internet free and open. I can't say there is too much here on Zeronet that I like specifically other than being completely decentralized. I applaud the effort to get this board running and functional and hope that users will stick around to add content that draw even more people here.",
