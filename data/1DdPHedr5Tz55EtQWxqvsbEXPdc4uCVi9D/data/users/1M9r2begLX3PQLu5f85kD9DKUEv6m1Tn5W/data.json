It might not make it \"healthy\" but soaking and fermenting seeds and other foods has always been a way to reduce the amounts of toxic substances naturally occurring in food.\n>MSG\nArtificially extracted pointless chemical. I don't know if it's going to give you cancer, but why consume it when it's not necessary? Unless it's used to help you eat healthy foods that you wouldn't otherwise, I guess.\n>Aspartame\nI bet they all increase your chances of cancer. But I guess their consumption is excusable since it's a replacement for sugar.\n>You get the picture. So, what actions CAN we take to live long and healthy lives in regards to our food diets?\nI bet as long as you're cooking your own food and avoid stuff like cooking oil, bread, rice, etc, there isn't really much you can do other than try to get organic grown stuff. Getting a water filter so you don't get drown in the estrogen that comes out of women's piss when on the pill and avoiding vaccines would probably be more important than any food choices.",
