The problem is that boards that don't have any traffic will be ignored by those that already have traffic (ie: /pol/ posts overshadow all the other boards)\nIt may sound stupid, but think about this. A system that allows you to see multiple lists of recent posts that can be modified (example: a list for all the recent posts on /pol/, and a list for all the recent posts on all the zite)\nThis will encourage anons to look for each other and their posts will be more relevant due to having more exposition.",
