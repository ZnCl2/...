Judging from the posting activity on here, there won't be more than two people using the software, so the chances that somebody would detect a virus on it and alert everybody else would be very low.\n>>f061a786-7bdb-43c7-a50f-85682aba29fa\nThat is how the taylovedus fag does it. If you meant creating a script that downloads tor browser and configures it however you see fit, then go ahead. Good luck reliably generating a ZeroID though, which is probably the hardest part of the process anyway.",

It will take a lot of work to find the owner's IP even if he connects through the clearnet.\nAnd taking down the owner is not enough if he is using FDE, you need to force him to reveal his FDE key if his computer is encrypted when found.\n>>9596c41f-a5f1-4ebb-9f1b-b2ec50ee73c6\nNope. A site owner can't retrieve private key without breaking out of the js wrapper. It's true XSS or malicious owner will allow IP leak if not using Tor Browser or similar.",
