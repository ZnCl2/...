			"body": "You're all familiar with the jewish name game. The same thing has been done to the US Code with common words such as \"employee\", \"wages\", and \"trade or business\". You think it means one thing, but in regards to the \"income\" tax it means something entirely different.\n\nOn your Form 4852 (W-2 Replacement Form), your reason for changing the W-2 numbers refers to section 3121 and 3401 of Title 26 (Title 26 is the Internal Revenue Code). Notice line 5 thats states \"Employer's OR PAYER's name\". The IRS is fully aware of its own definitions, but you are not. Note as well, in line 9 the word payer is specifically used.\n\ntl;dr for next post\nAn \"employee\" is an elected official of the \"United States\" or a \"State\". A \"State\" is D.C. or the territories, NOT the 50 states. \"Wages\" is renumeration for an \"employee\". Do you work for the US government? If not, then you are not an \"employee\" making \"wages\", and thus have no \"income\". Because you have no \"income\", you are not subject to the tax and thus are not a \"taxpayer\".\n\nA \"trade or business\" is a public office. It is not what you call a business, and not what you call the trades, like a roofer.\n\nThere is no easy way to copy+paste the code. It's massive, and there's little time so I must use brevity. I will pick what I think is most important, and lessen the wall of text.\n\nNotice, too, they '''REDEFINE \"INCLUDES AND INCLUDING\"'''. You want pilpul? There it is. It simply means the word they have redefined means only what comes after \"includes and including\", and nothing more. The normal definition of the word as you know it does not apply, because '''THEY HAVE REDFINIED IT'''.",

			"body": "A primer on the 16th amendment.\nhttp://www.losthorizons.com/The16th.htm\n\n\tThe court also repeats and reinforces its declaration from the Pollock ruling that such a tax can only be laid as an excise-- noting that the Article 1, Section 9 Constitutional prohibition on unapportioned direct taxes had not been repealed.\n\t\n\t\t''\"We are of opinion, however, that the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion that the 16th Amendment provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation; that is, a power to levy an income tax which, although direct, should not be subject to the regulation of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes. And the far-reaching effect of this erroneous assumption will be made clear by generalizing the many contentions advanced in argument to support it...\"''\n\n\t\t''\"But it clearly results that the proposition and the contentions under it, if acceded to, would cause one provision of the Constitution to destroy another; that is, they would result in bringing the provisions of the Amendment exempting a direct tax from apportionment into irreconcilable conflict with the general requirement that all direct taxes be apportioned.\"''\n\n\tThe court points out that the amendment had in no way modified or expanded the meaning of the word \"income\" as lawfully used in a taxing statute. Nor had it changed the requirement that the application of any such statute must be confined to the forms and proper subjects of an excise- licensed or privileged activities. It simply provided that the constitutionality of such a tax could no longer be challenged by reference to untaxable property connected with any particular \"income\". Such a challenge, in other words, can only argue against the taxability of the activity to which the \"income\" tax is being applied.\n\t\nCracking the Code - The Fascinating Truth About Taxation in America (Hendrickson) (2003); p36",

			"body": "Here is an example of a state income tax law; for Massachusetts. You will have to find your own. Keep in mind '''THERE ARE SOME STATES''' that do not base their state income tax on the Federal \"income\" tax. I do not know which, but they are few.\n\nOnce you have read the book and portions of the code, reading your own state's code will be easy. Also note the definition for \"Trade or business\" points to a part of the US Code that does not actually define the term. Therefore, section 7701 takes precedence because it defines for the '''ENTIRE TITLE 26'''. My third post has section 7701. Realise that in order to understand a simple line in the Massachusetts code; Section 2(a), you must delve into multiple sections of the US Code, sections that are thousands of words apart from each other. It is written in this manner specifically to confuse you.\n\nSection 2. (a) Massachusetts gross income shall mean the federal gross income\n\nhttps://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleIX/Chapter62/Section2\n\nSection 1: Definitions \n\t\tSection 1. When used in this chapter the following words or terms shall, unless the context indicates otherwise, have the following meanings: \n\t\t(c) Code, the Internal Revenue Code of the United States,\n\t\t(d) Federal gross income, gross income as defined under the Code.\n\t\t(l) Trade or business shall have the same meaning as in section sixty-two of the Code.*\n\t\t(m) The term capital asset shall have the meaning as given in section one thousand two hundred and twenty-one of the Code\n\t\tThe term capital gain income shall mean gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset.\n*\"Trade or business is not defined in section 62. See Section 7701 for definition.\n\t\t\nhttps://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleIX/Chapter62/Section1\n\n26 USC 61: Gross income defined\n\tยง61. Gross income defined\n\t(a) General definition\n\t\tExcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income from whatever source derived,\n\t\t\nhttp://uscode.w.gov/view.xhtml?req=title:26%20section:61%20edition:prelim\n\n26 USC 1221: Capital asset defined\n\tยง1221.

I didn't either, but I kept reading. I looked over the US Code over and over to make sure it wasn't some nonsense that only applied to a tiny portion of a tiny chapter, like the \"United States is a corpoation\" nonsense.\n\nAll those refund checks are undeniable proof.\n\nKeep in mind. They WILL send letters back. They'll kick and scream, threaten you with fines and jail time, but they CANNOT do it unless you give in to their demands. Here is a link to those more drawn out refunds, complete with letters both sent and received.

Direct, unapportioned taxes are only constitutional if they are applied to federally privileged gains, which the \"income\" tax follows as the general person does not work for a federal or state government.\n\nPrior to WW2, almost no one paid an income tax because everyone knew it didn't apply to them. Then everyone was convinced into voluntarily paying it to fight the ebil knatzees, but after the war the government decided to keep sending out forms anyway. And people complied, and paid.\n\nThe problem I assume your neighbor went through, the same as many others such as Irwin Schiff, and the author of the book prior to reading the code, is they say the income tax is unconstitutional, or that their \"wages\" can't be taxed without knowing that the word \"wages\" has been redefined in the code, for example.\n\nThe only reason what I have posted is possible now is because we have access to an easily searchable, digital format of the US Code.\n\nThe guy who wrote that book, and his website, are still around. Still free. This started in 2003.",
