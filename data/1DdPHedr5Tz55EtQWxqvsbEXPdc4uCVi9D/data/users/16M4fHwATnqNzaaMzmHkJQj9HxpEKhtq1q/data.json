Just look at IBM. 108 year old company, \"creator\" of the personal computer, and they're not even worth a fraction of what Apple and Microsoft are worth (**In fact, the only reason they're still around is because of India buying all their tech**). Hell, Unix was available to the public for 8 years before MS-DOS came into the picture, followed by Mac OS, and, then, Windows; and the prevailing joke now is that the only people who use Unix (And it's forks) are hipsters and preppers. **And, this is ''ALSO'' leaving out that Plan 9, '''Unix's successor''', was left as a footnote in history due to the terrible marketing the thing was while Unix is still being actively developed to this very day.**\n\nBefore you someone says that this is in defense of all the actions these companies make, ==it is not.== The point I'm trying to make is that \"being smart\" doesn't a damn thing. A lot of smart people are dead broke, meanwhile \"the idiots\" who can sell people on a dream, on an idea, are living like kings.
