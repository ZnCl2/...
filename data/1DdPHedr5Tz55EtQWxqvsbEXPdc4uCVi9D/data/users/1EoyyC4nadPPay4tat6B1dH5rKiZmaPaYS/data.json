Despite what the poojeets will tell you, it's actually very hard to make good machine learning models. And for a chatbot you need one, and even then you probably would have to go with a mixed approach, adding hardcoded rules to the system, since even the best seq2seq models only manage to put together mostly incoherent sentences.\nNot to mention that a chatbot is not exactly high in the list of things that would be actually useful to humanity.",
