They are the ones who developed it, they are the ones who know how the code works. Hacking a compiled half-minified js file of an unknown version of a typescript project is an uphill battle.",

Bugging in sounds cheaper because you don't need a secondary property, plus you can keep all the equipment you already have (tools etc).\nIn any case I'm positive the bug out location should be made of concrete so it can be effectively defended without it getting burned down by packs of roaming niggers.",
