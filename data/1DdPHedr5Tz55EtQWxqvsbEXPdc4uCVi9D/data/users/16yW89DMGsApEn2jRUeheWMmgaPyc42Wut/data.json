			"body": "== Adding new features to the board ==\n\nHi. I'm currently taking requests to add new features to the zite. Which of the following features would you like to see implemented? Just pick one, give a short justification for it and I'll count your vote. Please consider some features would be easier to implement than others. Estimated difficulty is in parentheses. Current votes in square brackets.\n\n1. Mute button on the catalog (2/10) [0]\n2. Ability to hide threads and posts without muting an user (4/10) [0]\n3. Ability to store the board on a spare partition with plausible deniability to run it from Tails (8/10) [0]\n4. Script to easily create and switch between ZeroID certs (5/10) [0]\n5. Research the possibility of setting up a custom CA, which would make it possible to generate certs for every post, basically making everyone anonymous, but it would still be centralized and open to for example DDoS (7/10) [0]\n6. Research seed ratio based proof-of-work for posting, which would allow decentralized anonymous posting without additional CPU usage (9/10) [0]\n7. Research CPU based proof-of-work for posting, which would mean anonymous decentralized posting but result in higher CPU usage (7/10) [0]\n8. Ability to subscribe to other people's blacklists (5/10) [1: usernamesareover]\n9. Research ability to fork the board while preserving people's posts (for example, to run your own custom board software without people having to update theirs manually) (6/10) [0]\n10. Ability to store people's deleted post and edit histories (4/10) [0]\n11. A version of the board's software that doesn't display names by default and doesn't show the option to enable them (2/10) [4: removeboomer, zeronetuser99, 263222931, s5sohmvgm5]\n12. CSS to imitate legacy 8chan looks (3/10) [1: mudpeople]\n13. Make Millchan faster and less bloated (6/10) [1: taylovedyou]\n14. Livestreaming capabilities (6/10) [0]\n15. Publicly accessible crowdsourced changelog of the zite's code to easily detect any modifications to it the admin (or whoever gets his private key) might make (2/10) [0]\n16. Ability to easily read all posts made by a user (4/10) [0]\n17. Proof of concept software to demonstrate ways in which users might be tracked even when switching IDs (5/10) [0]\n18. Add statistics to the zite (3/10) [0]\n19. Add pinktext support (1/10) [0]\n20. Add numbered lists (2/10) [0] \n21. Add polls (3/10) [0]\nAdditional features not on this list are also welcome.\n\nEstimated delivery times\n1/10 1 month\n2/10 3 months\n3/10 6 months\n4/10 9 months\n5/10 1 year\n6/10 1.5 years\n7/10 2 years\n8/10 2.5 years\n9/10 3 years\n10/10 4 years\n\n** Just like with any project, these numbers are probably optimistic. Multiply by 3 to get a more realistic estimate. **",

Then the problem becomes bootstrapping the system, since you obviously can't just keep the code for the encryption program in plaintext or even in a reguarly encrypted disk. But you might be able to download it from a publicly accessible hidden service every time you boot your machine, for example. You can even boot your OS from such a hidden container if you use kexec or VMs, it would just require some initrd hacking and stuff.\n\n>>0df6eac2-4b6e-480b-a8d9-313724921b9f\nCan you post the links?\n\n>>8cc89ad9-8622-41a2-8712-4e99ed1058c8\nI don't. Repos are a pain in the ass to work with without breaking anonymity, since all the tooling is geared towards working over the clearnet while pasting your real name all over the place.\n\n>>4280f9e3-6da3-479c-9d4e-fe396507c053\nYeah, that one was probably over estimated. There's no reason CSS for Millchan should be inherently harder than for a normal website. But still, accessing the archives of the old 8chan, getting the color values for everything, and changing every button style, corners, animations, colors and all that shit on the zite that's using a completely different style now without anything looking out of place looks like a pain in the ass. Oh, and the css names are hardcoded in multiple places in the javascript for some reason, so I'd probably have to look into changing that too if I want to change it from just dark.css and light.css.\n\n>>38bd9e12-0be6-4fd3-b322-1210cd820476\n>>4280f9e3-6da3-479c-9d4e-fe396507c053\n>>ba1a14e9-f827-4be8-8595-6ae98e8ea30e\nOne vote per ID please.",

Because it would require admin permissions? Just have everyone generate self-signed certs and validate them by a centralized server before posting, and mute anyone who tried to push a post without a valid signature of his auth_address by the ID validation server.

			"body": "Alright, [here](https://anonfile.com/e4DdKf49n4/stuff_zip) is a Millchan build that I know for sure supports .zip (by default, thanks to mcdev), and I tried to make it compatible with the other files too (and probably failed, but I'm not sure why).\nThe problem you were having is that part of the \"processing\" stage involves having your files accepted by other peers, and that obviously won't happen if they haven't been updated yet, so it's kind of a catch 22. I'm afraid you'll have to push the fix to know if it'll work. Only try to publish posts with any weird extension that isn't .zip using a disposable ZID account though, because I think it'll fuck up your user folder for some reason and require a reinstall of ZeroNet to fix it (I haven't managed to isolate exactly what files are the ones getting fucked up).\nAnother thing worth mentioning is this is a newer Millchan build, so there have been some changes, mostly aesthetic.",

You can delete your own content from other people's clients by pushing an update of your data.json without the content you want gone. Of course this only works for content for which you have the private key (which basically means you are the author). For some reason when I was working on an update to the site to make it possible to post more file types (which is [here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HamXwKoauiykRmVLrQxDVjRGoVZX7ngkE/) btw), the content in my data.json was deleted and my client automatically signed the new version and pushed it to other clients, which accepted the new version.",
