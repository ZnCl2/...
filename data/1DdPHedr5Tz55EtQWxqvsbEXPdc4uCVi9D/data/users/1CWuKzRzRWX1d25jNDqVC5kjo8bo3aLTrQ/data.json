People sometimes feel instinctively that liberty is a powerful means to success.    \n\nThe universe will favor collectives that strive to continue.  This success will be at the expense of the liberty of individuals outside those collectives first, and often, even unnecessarily, also for members of those very (ugly and oppressed) collectives as well.\n\nLibertarians should strive to keep the collective they strive as a member of as free as possible while making allowances for their social unit to be sufficiently unified to be competitive among other collectives.  Liberty is an aesthetic ideal.  We like it because it offers opportunity we think.  There are competitive benefits to liberty as well that mean collectives that provide liberty for their members may compete successfully against collectives that trade all their individual members' liberty for unity.  \n\nBut success is not a liberty cargo cult.  You can't just liberty and count on success to magically appear because that ideal is somehow blessed by the stars.   Competition is always happening between collectives as well as between individuals.  The universe is not biased as to who prevails, life merely poses the question and the living strive to exhibit the answer.\n\nTo see this the value of collective unity, just look at the collectivism in eusocial beings and among cells and even in units like dog-packs.  There are situations where collectivism is good.\n\nHowever individuals can evolve faster than collectives.  This is the competitive advantage in liberty.  Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, but we multicelluar humans aren't yet resistant to cyanide.",

Thanks, and it is comfy.\n\nThe only weakness ( which I admit this place hasn't grown to need yet, but hopefully will ) is some kind of way to leverage the moderation done by other users in a way that doesn't  let them impose their opinions on users.\n\nWhat I was thinking is have a way for users to publish their blacklists, and have blacklists automatically composed of other users' blacklists.  Maybe there could be a weighting system where you assign a weight of .5 to someone's blacklist and it cuts the probablity in half that one of the things they blacklisted are shown.  Maybe have an icon that says:This item was blacklisted by subscription (only when the post is shown) and have a dropdown saying which list blacklisted it.  If someone repeatedly blacklists good stuff you blacklist their blacklist ( or just unsubscribe ).   You would  want it to be probabilistic so you can monitor abuse by the people you subscribe to.

It even seems to have shill threads.  \n\nNeinchan looks to be remodeling.  They would allow tor image posting if you emailed them to get an ID ( and you could use a fake/torrified email address )\n\nOn the plus side, 16chan is easier to get into.  Just download  the tor browser,  \n\nHowever those sites have real world web addresses with people attached.  They can be shut down, or else controlled.  Neinchan seems to be run by a young man .    Don't know who runs 16chan.    \n\nThe local spooks or perhaps foreign spooks run the chans or at least shelter them.  Perhaps spooks from various places are involved.  One with too-good service may be spook-run ( even if it's a free-radio-russia kind of operation )\n\n08 chan seems to be truly distributed and doesn't require resources.  This makes it the least likely in my mind to be spook run.\n\nIt should work on efficient distributed subscription based moderation and becoming the best chan out there as well as the bunker of last resort..\n\nThe (small) techical barrier to entry may serve to keep the riff-raff out and make this a place where high quality discussions can be had.\n\nI guess I don't care, when using torrified connection if spooks run it.
