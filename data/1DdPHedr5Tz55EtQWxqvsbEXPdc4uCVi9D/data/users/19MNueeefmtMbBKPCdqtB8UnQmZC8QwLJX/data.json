I saw people were spamming this shit on /g/ like crazy, but I thought it was some twitter trannies nobody gave a shit in the real world.\nI wonder how that talk went. Like, \"Richard, I'm afraid we have to speak\" or something like that? It's interesting how they're using the pedophilia angle to get rid of him when people at /pol/ always say leftists are trying to push pedo acceptance. But I guess if I pointed that to them they'd just say \"leftists are hypocrites, no shit\".\nIn any case, I don't think that matters. Except maybe preventing Stallman from traveling around the world with the money from the talks which I imagine will dry up now. I wonder if this was started just by that medium trannie or it was coordinated at a higher level, and if the pressure came directly from the FSF's lawyers when seeing the fake outrage or it was coming from above.\nI wonder if \"Stallkike\" intended the FSF to become a lawyer controlled useless org right from the beginning and the tribe turned on him or it just kind of happened as the organization grew and he wasn't purposefully giving control to them.",

The developers hadn't realized anonymity was impossible with the way ZeroNet currently works before they began working on it. If you mean self-signed certificates, then it was disabled because of spam.\nThe **final** solution to the ID problem is combining seed ratio, proof of work, web of trust and captchas to make a CA that works with a ZeroNet plugin, but it would take a big programming effort to get it done.\nZeroID used to work with Tor Browser, but the gitcenter autist had to ruin it for us by spamming ZeroTalk with it on a power grab move attempting to prove nofish's leadership as inadequate, forcing nofish to block Tor.\nAdmittedly at the time I thought he was right to question nofish, but now with RMS being kicked out of the FSF and all the other SJW shit I see why nofish rules ZeroNet with an iron fist. If he moved it to a decentralized power model the corporate sponsored SJWs would take over.",
