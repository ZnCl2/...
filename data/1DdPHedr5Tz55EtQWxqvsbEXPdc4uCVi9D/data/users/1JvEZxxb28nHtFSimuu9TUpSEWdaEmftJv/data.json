Currently waiting for ZeroNet to offer a way to generate new IDs before every post to make it possible to be actually anonymous. You can go badger nofish for that. Meanwhile you can use the script that has been mentioned above, or at the very least, mash your keyboard when ZeroID asks you for a username. You can get rid of your current ID by renaming the /data/users.json file from your ZeroNet folder, right clicking on ZeroNet's icon in the system tray and choosing close.",
