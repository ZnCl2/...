I think she will develop perspectives that allign with ecofacism, especially given sweden's experience with black and brown immigration. I think that cognitive dissonance between the soros leftists that dote on her and red pills that she will find by herself will be a challenge. I sense that her aggression will put her points of view inevitiably towards ecofacism and perhaps ethnonationalism. I dont like how she is portrayed as a spoiled brat or nieve, i think she has enormous potential and is not to be dismissed.",

Lots of  derogatory comments about her appearance, violence and rape fantasies, accusations about being privlidged, speculaton on mental health and general Reeeee. Scant positive postings and  much cross eyed statements equating climate change and social justice politics. This is what sets up a kind of alarm sounding in my mind that something of a phenomenon is going on. \nI start to play the \"5 Why's\" game in my imagination. \n\nWhy does she trigger you?\n> \"Because of her punchable face\" \nShe's just a girl why do you want to punch her? \n> \"Because she challenges me\"\nChallenges shouldnt provoke such strong responses, why the reeee? \n> \"because its more than a challenge to my capabilities, its a challenge to my state of existence.\" \nBut all you know about her is a couple of half remembered MSM sound bytes and imageboard memes, why is your reeee based on utter shit?\" \n>\"because she's a vegan\"\nWhy do vegans trigger your reeee?\n>\"becase they're vegans\"\n\nCertainly Greta is something of a firestarter and all the reeee! on the free speech forums may be have been predictable, such as it is.\nMy journey into these strange lands of synthesis -> speech -> action is, i believe, requiring all effort of creativity and discipline.\nReading between lines drawn on the  shifting sands of internet anonymity sometimes means staring into the abyss.",

The narrative is that the skipper Boris Herrman and Princeling owner Pierre casiraghi are to fly back to Europe and have employees  fly out to return the boat back to france in time for a race. Thats four person-equivalent crossings for a supposedly zero emissions journey. \nBad Optics.\nHowever, I suggest that GT did not know about the princelings plans before agreeing to his offer. \n Plans which could have been made after the boat departed. \nThis journey stinks like a betrayal of GT's deeply held beliefs, a bait and switch by this affluent arsehole, who seems to have been motivated by publicity, or perhaps simply doesn't get it.\n And where is the outrage?  Directed at Greta, apparently. \nI hope this is a lesson for her that the ultra wealthy may well share her agenda but never her belief. \n\nGT Remains in the US  for appearances. No method of return has been reported. The boat Malizia ii is due in a transatlantic race directly after its apperance in france.",
