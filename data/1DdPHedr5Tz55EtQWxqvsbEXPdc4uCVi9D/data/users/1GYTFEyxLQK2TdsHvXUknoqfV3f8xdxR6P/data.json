I missed quite a few, but the point was to illustrate that the left owns much more prime real estate than we do.\n\nI'm not trying to be too black pilled here. We have truth on our side. Truth is a powerful wild card. And the mainstream media is dying a slow death. They have been on a tare for decades but they are starting to cede some ground. And the left fundamentally derives its strength from weakness. It's victim-hood power. That is the kind of tenuous power that demands millions of highly indoctrinated white knights to not break free from any of their conditioning. The moment people get the idea that maybe power should come from strength not weakness they could be in serious trouble fast. If power can be viewed as height, they are very high in the air, but on a very precarious structure.\n\nAgain though, back to the original point, its a strategic mistake to attack before you are stronger than your enemy. Don't make this mistake. Part of the reason the left is in the dominate position they are is they didn't make this mistake. They patiently built for decades or even centuries before taking the gloves off.",

It's kind of an amalgam of two different ideas that are hard to tie together with a singular more fundamental root cause but that taken together explain everything. \n\nFirst: The opposition to human differences. The right says it's okay that people are different. It's comfortable with the fact that some people are better than others. It seeks to empower the best among us for the betterment of all. The left denies/is uncomfortable with the fact that some people are better than others and seeks to eliminate these differences by elevating the low and pulling down the high.\n\nSecond: The left is entropy. It is the force that breaks down restrictive social institutions. This is how you can always recognize what is a leftist policy. It says we don't need to make that sacrifice anymore. We don't need that kind of discipline any more. It is the grasshopper that says to the ant, stop working so hard and relax with me, It'll be fine! People can be any gender they want, it'll be fine! People can stop working so hard because there is a social safety net, it'll be fine! You don't need to go to church and build a moral community, we will make a few laws and it'll be fine! The right is that force that sweats and toils to push the boulder that is civilization up that endless hill, and the left is the force that seeks to achieve power through the expediency that is riding it back down that hill again.",
