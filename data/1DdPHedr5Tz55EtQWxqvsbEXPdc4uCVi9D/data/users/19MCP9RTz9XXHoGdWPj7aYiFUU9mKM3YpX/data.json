			"body": "==ITT we keep thoughtcrime alive==\n\nI've increasingly been drip-feeding my friends redpills, and I find myself needing to send them a video or two for reference. \n\nDisturbingly, these videos have a trend of (((disappearing))). Most recently, I went to go find the Youtube video of some guy going undercover and interviewing a bunch of fags about their sexual history. The video is about 30 minutes long, and he goes to multiple bars and they talk about how they were mostly abused. I think it was fairly popular and I'm sure some of you autists remember it.\n\nThis is the original link (not that it matters): https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=sTYvTj8Ss6g\n\nDoes anyone have a saved or archived version?\n\nAdditionally, I went to find a video about some fake holocaust survivor being interviewed by a mainstream outlet. It's pretty old, and I remember him saying \"It was true to me\" or something like that. Any source on this would be appreciated.\n\n\nAlso, I figure ITT we ask fellow anons for help located similarly disappearing content. I'm sure this will only happen more frequently as time passes.",

Allowed foods are anything that comes from animals: muscle meat, fat (including bone marrow), dairy (preferably raw and fermented in some way), fish, eggs, organ meats, and some raw honey. The only carbs that are considered carnivore are milk and honey, otherwise it's completely keto. \n\nCheck out Dr. Shawn Baker's channel on jtube, he is a great example of what eating like that can do for you.",

Cooked rare. Agreed that's very important. \n\nI do eat the occasional plant here and there. As far as I can tell though fiber is needed when eating carbs; carbs always come with fiber in nature, but processed foods remove the fiber but keep the carbs. If you don't eat carbs, there's no constipation whatsoever so the fiber just irritates your digestive system and causes unnecessary shitting.",
