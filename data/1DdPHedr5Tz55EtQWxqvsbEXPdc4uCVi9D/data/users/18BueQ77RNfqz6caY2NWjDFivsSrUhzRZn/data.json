			"body": "Since 8chan went down and it seems like it's going to have some issues coming back online again I'll continue positing on here instead. I'll repost the progress that has been made and the discord where you can help out in the development or pose any questions you might have.\n\nDiscord link: https://discord.gg/6jJfJYW\n\nF.A.Q:\n\n>What is this the original game called?\nThe game is called Forest Of Blueskin and is made by a guy named zell999. You can find his blog on this website: http://zell999.blog.fc2.com/ He only speaks japanese so you will have to translate the website. An English and Japanese version of the game is available. So make sure you get the right one!\n\n>What is the purpose of this remake\nThe game is written in an older game engine (IG Maker) and has a bunch of limitations (including filesize). Because of this limitation zell999 has started splitting up the original game into two different games with compatible save files. This project is an attempt to use a more modern game engine (Godot) and merge the two games into one. Other advantages of Godot are: much less resource intensive, fullscreen, 16:9 aspect, Linux and macOS and Windows and Android and IOS support. The full screen future is very, very nice.\n\n>Are there any differences between the original and the remake?\nSmall changes may exist where deemed necessary. These will be kept to a minimum and will mostly be small tweaks to the mechanics of the game. All art and animations will be replicated as closely as possible.\n\n>Can I see the code you made?\nThe code I have written is a fork (copy) of a gitgud project (alternative to github) that aimed to remake FOBS. You can find it here: https://gitgud.io/pikachu/fobs_godot/\n\nYou can find the original project here: https://gitgud.io/icaur5/fobs_godot\nA second fork by Gwenora can be found here: https://gitgud.io/gwenora/fobs_godot\n\n>What does zell999 feel about all this?\nSo far I have heard nothing of Zell. If the remake makes significant progress he might contact us. I have no intent of making money of his work. I making this remake because I enjoy programming, game design and zell's original game.\n",

Do you want herms to default to the cock version or to get one randomly?\n\n>when she [if (ischild) {…|trembles under your touch when\n\nHey, at least it's not \"as\".\n\n>her skin already flushed with a heady mixture of embarrassment and lust.\n\nI'm probably being overly autistic here, so I'll preface this note by saying that it's fine to ignore if you disagree, but this feels like a bit too far towards third person perspective to me (probably the \"heady\").\n\n>Her breath quickens when you lean in, already so eager despite her [if (ischild) {earlier hesitation|age}]\n\n\"Eager\" is a dangling modifier.\n\n>No matter what she says, her body tells a different story\n\nDid she say anything that would indicate otherwise? She hasn't really said anything at all in a bit.\n\n>in thick, muggy waves that makes\n\n-s\n\n>in thick, muggy waves that makes [if (normal skin) your skin flushed|your body tingle] and mind muddled just from her touch\n\nSo is it the heat (i.e., waves) that makes that happen, or her touch? Also, I'd recommend making \"flushed\" into just \"flush\", but that would cause a parallelism problem (i.e., joining different kinds of things with a conjunction) with \"your mind muddled\"; however, you already have that problem with \"your body tingle\", so I'd recommend some general fiddling.\n\n>You never thought you'd fall for someone [if (pc is child)so quickly| young enough to be your [if (teen) little sister| [if (elder) grand]daughter]],\n\nSome people would certainly have thought that (you know who you are), and also, \"fall for\" seems maybe a tad strong. Sure she's got the lust magic, but there's no check for how affected you are. The second complaint might be ignorable, dunno.\n\n>but now, when you're holding her in your arms, her lips quivering with anticipation as she glances [if (pc is not child sized) up] into your eyes, you've never felt anything more right.\n\nI'm not sure that the present perfect is appropriate in \"you've never felt\", as the rest of the sentences makes clear that this is in reference to that specific moment in time. I might recommend adding in a \"you know (that)\" or similar before it.\n\n>as you hold back, not giving in to her rising desires just yet.\n\nJust want to make sure that's not meant to be \"your\". It's fine if this was your intent, but your own desires seem like a more pressing concern.\n\n>Even that pales to the tiny, breathy sigh she gives before [if (pc is child size) leaning forward\n\nHow can she lean forward if she's hugging you close?\n\n>her eyes drinking in every inch of your exposed form with a hunger [if (pc is child) you've never seen before.\n\nThis is definitely a game where a kid could have experienced that kind of thing already. I'm biased against this kind of hyperbole, though, so make of that what you will.\n\n>[say: Let me.]\n\nI could see that standing on its own if you'd tried to remove your clothes yourself, but in the absence of that happening, I might recommend an ellipsis here.\n\n>[say: It's so pretty…]\n\nI might recommend a \"they're\", given that you've already used \"they\" for them and I don't see what \"it\" would replace.\n\n>[if (day) {day|night}]\n\nYeah, I was thinking about doing something like [daynight]. These are a bit annoying to deal with, since there are so many slightly different cases.\n\n>she pulls back ever-so-slightly until your [if (isgoo) slime jiggles|nipple tingles] in the breeze.\n\nI'd probably recommend a comma after \"slightly\".\n\n>[alice panty descript]\n\nBy the way, they have both a short and a long description, if you'd like to play around with that at all (https://gitgud.io/BelshazzarII/CoCAnon_mod/blob/master/classes/classes/Scenes/Areas/Forest/AliceScene.as#L145). No pressure if you don't want to, but it seems like something you'd want to know. The specific parser tags are [alicepanties] and [alicepantieslong].\n",

It's mostly redundant at this point, but some of you might like to have it for some feature KW doesn't support.\n\nRomance flags are off for everything but \"MakeOut\" and \"ConfessAttraction\"\n\nChild relationships are (as always) a one-way thing with how KW handles them. You can't MC your way back out of a child romance. I'll be trying to fix this at some point, but it's uphill all the way with my coding ability. (none)\n\nTimmy's code mods are not included because I'm not anywhere as good as he is and can't adjust them to fit my ideas yet.

Increasing lewdity lowers lust a lot\n\n- passive lewdity based lust change is halved\n\nCharacterCreation/Start:\n\n- elemental affinity: choose between grass/fire/water for various starting bonuses (evolvable spirit summon, new versatile skills, specialtrait, statbonus)\n\n- difficulty modifiers: can toggle various rules that make things harder for a flat percentage increase to difficulty.\n\nCharacter/species:\n\n- 12 new species/spirits for starting affinity (mostly creatures)\n\n- Spirits are mostly fusion based and can be fused with any non-spirit. They have a new unique genetic trait. Fusing a character with a spirit only considers the species of the non-spirit for the result. Evolutions work similar to seedlings, but you can choose various skill/leveltype sets.\n\n- some art changes\n\n- lizard now also has variable bodypart sizes/clothes (all basespecies now)\n\nOther:\n\n- genes are generally assigned in totals, randomly spread and not separately per gene. (not only for wild characters).\n\n- Some characters' genes now scale based on gametime (hired through events/brothel etc.)\n\n- stat increases are no longer random. (hidden progressbar for each stat, that increases based on genes/leveltype).\n\n- Leveltypes/levels matter more even for characters with low genes\n\n- unique characters gain more stats/progress on levelup\n\n- randomencounter chance scales more fluidly for everything (stealth,hivecount,distance to portal)(instead of various thresholds).\n\n- new achievement + unlockable profession\n\n- many things have predetermined outcomes (reloading and doing the same thing will have the same result (events,summons,fusion etc.))\n\n- removed morale requirement for quick-fusion\n\nBalance:\n\n- generally levels should increase stats more on average, but less extreme for high genes (balancing stat gains etc should be easier)\n\n- mana increases slower (more like str/mg instead of hp)\n\n- max amount of enemies globally decreased (10+ enemies in every battle at final portal was just pure bullshit)\n\n- base movementcost through water decreased to 15 (from 20)\n\n- gene adapter doesn't work on mc (genes are more meaningful in character creation)(specialform/summons requirements lowered to be achievable anyway)\n\n- busty/petite pointcost is now 0 (neither is really positive or negative)\n\n- fused characters maxlevel/exhaustion is the average of both characters.\n\n- seedlings (trait, not just the starting species) don't need food\n\n- a resulting species' basevalue for bodysizes etc. has a higher weight for determining their value in fusion/hatching\n\n- many other small adjustments to adapt to other changes\n\nSummary/Expected Effect:\n\n- faster pacing through higher focus on fusions/more early options\n\n- can move on to higher hostility portals sooner\n\n- stats feel actually based on genes/leveltype instead of being mostly random\n\n- easier to switch species in your main team (you don't just end up with slightly different/upgraded versions of the same 2 species forever)\n\n- more flexible/interesting start.\n\n- the way genes are distributed onto characters gives them clearer advantages/purposes\n\n- more control over difficulty.\n\n- easier to come back from early mistakes/losses\n\nNext:\n\n- new skilltree replacing the current \"C\" menu with lots of more interesting things/choices\n\n- more events/dating stuff\n\n- story events/paths/endings\n\nOverall, this update is decent.",

I'd say Witch Trainer is my favourite but it's because it's the most complete.\n\nOr better yet Four Elements Trainer and Witch trainer are both my favourite. Only downside to FET is that there is no \"be Azula's slave boy\" route. If you know of any game with such a storyline that can be played on linux or android I'd be very grateful. I just want to be some strong woman's slave is it too much to ask?\n\nSummertime saga is also really good story wise, lots of storylines. Witches and Wans also looks promising but it's way too early to tell.\n\nYou should probably start with Witch Trainer. It all happens in one room and it's really easy to play (it's complete and you can also cheat your way through).\n",

You can die, she can die, she can be mind broken, you can fail to train her, or you can succeed to varying degrees. You can whip her and have the game set for whipping to leave marks. Light whips marks are darker pink than the skin and go away quickly after a day or two at most. Hard whip marks are red and may turn into light ones and disappear in at minimum two days, but may also stay red and never go away. I've only really played the first one so far and have been having trouble getting to the final levels of training and getting endings other than third pic related. Any tips would be appreciated. I really REALLY like the noises she makes when being whipped. Normally I'm not into that level of violence, but this gets me rock fucking hard.\n\nWARNING\n\nThe enema option contains mosaic censored scat.

They of course get the tables turned on them immediately Tatsurou fulfills his character archetype by being cucked (Just kill him already. I know he's supposed to be the audience surrogate but the fact that he is literally there to be cucked makes him useless just by the rules of the fetish.) and a new 'Totally Badass Villain' who apparently is the real owner of Shiranui because he passed her around to Yazaki last game as this retcon says and he's a insanely powerful character like Black, that no one has ever heard of before because Black Lilith is the pinnacle of good writing. In the end, just like the last game the only way to win is not to play at all as the true ending has the cast get cold feet and not even start the mission to begin with so it is just a waste of time all around.",

			"body": "I KNOW WHY MAMA TAIMANIN WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nDUDE I FIGURED IT OUT! If you look at the writer for this game, FRAME is what he's called on VNDB, it shows he worked on Yukikaze 2, right? Well, only as an assistant writer. What games did he make in the years since Yukikaze 2 and Mama Wa Taimanin?\n\nAlmost ALL older woman conquest games, meaning no dynamic storylines with action or villains, etc. It's all \"here's the heroine, get her to succumb\" type stuff, which is fine but not for a Taimanin game.\n\nBut there's one title in particular that will explain everything.\n\nAnons, here is exhibit A in pic 1. I looked at the artwork for Mama Taimanin again, specifically the dynamic piece of Kana and [forgettable]'s clash. It's not only in the trailer but it's even in the game's OP. Now Lilith usually has a lot of these bullshots and pre-production pieces they use to market a game under basically false advertising. Nothing new, but this scene here is so fully realized in line art, color, shading, effects etc. that I don't think it was meant to be a bullshot. I think it was reused pre-production concept work for how the story could go.\n\nYou see, the whole conspiracy of abducted ex-Taimnin might have been the crux of the game's plot and given to a better writer, like our usual mainstay guy for example, it could have had two routes–the Shota route and the Demon route. Ultimately we kind of got the Demon route although it was rushed in the end. The Shota route? It ends on an inexplicable and fully out of character, not to mention out of plot (it doesn't really fit with the course of events prior), gangbang scene of the shota not only letting the other kids rail her but then exposing her to her own son.\n\nhuh It's almost as if it came out of left field and wasn't really thought out beyond \"we need a gangbang scene\".\n\nMy theory: the shota route would have been the alternate route where the heroine discovered the conspiracy and did the usual text-heavy and action-oriented Taimanin thing ala Kresnik, Annerose, etc. The other Taimanin, already corrupted, would have clashed with the heroine in the climax.\n\nHowever, somewhere early on or along the way this changed, and the game became almost explusively just a shota-dom story about a kid sexually accosting the older woman he loves to corrupt her into being his. It's so not Taimanin that the Taimanin heroine only appears in her costume three times the whole game, two of those times being in the same night (one event after another), and all of them only being basically cosplay sex.\n\nThat's where FRAME comes in! You see, FRAME worked on another title before, a shorter title featuring a transforming/henshin heroine with short hair and big tits who is married and views the shota protagonist fondly almost as if he's part of the family. The shota, however, wants to make her his own and over the course of a week he teases her until she submits to him. His obsessive love wins in the end. Despite being a henshin heroine, though, she only appears in her outfit two or three times, basically as cosplay sex.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nFRAME BASICALLY REHASHED PIC 2 It's one of his earlier works and plays out exactly as you'd expect it's pretty good, though with such a simple plot it's hard to screw it up.\n\nI put it like this– whoever came up with the idea for Mama wa Taimanin had a story in mind that was closer to typical Lilith games, but after giving it to Frame, who already had a backlog of titles with themes of sexual older women and younger protags, it was written to be the bland game that it is now. Why? Because Frame doesn't really have the imagination for a story with action and narrative like a Taimanin game. And if he ever did it was years ago and after working on similar projects with similar themes for the recent years he just did the same thing again.\n\nNow mind you there are differences. In Mama Taimanin the shota is a dumb kid who slowly becomes more corrupted as he corrupts the object of his obsession (after being poisoned by the demon and awakening to sex by the ritual Kana preforms to exercise him). In the other game the shota is more like the kid from Ochiru hitozuma, where he's cunning and crafty, but he's singulalry obsessed with the woman/heroine his grandfather, who was once a supervillain, was fixated on. He uses drugs stashed away from his grandpa ages ago, which he never got to use, and teases her into sex until she fully submits to him.\n\nBut the differences in the shota and otherwise are minor points. Overall, Frame essentially rehashed his older work and I believe ruined what was perhaps initially intended to be much more.\n\nAlso I could swear that surprise gangbang at the end of the shota's route was rush out of time constraints and also just added in because Lilith has a gangbang quota for Taimanin games.\n",

Take out all the H-content and this is still a fantastic RPG that is a must play for any RPG fan. Can't recommend this one highly enough)\n\nMature Quest (I adore this one too. It's basically Dragon Quest with H-content)\n\nVirgins Protection Magic (Cool characters, tons of clothing options, decent difficulty level. Yeah, it's a good RPG. Not up to the level of the above two but it's probably my 3rd favorite H-RPG)",

Dev has been milking for years\n\n>House Party\n\n<Let's watch out poorly 3D modeled characters bum around and have \"sex\" with each other that looks like something out of Hot Coffee.\n\n>Girlvania\n\n<Not worth the price, made by some slavs and FxF only.\n\n>Rabbit Burn\n\n<Ehhhh. It's like 3D pool in a way. It's okay, I guess. Nothing really redeeming.\n\n>Sassy squad\n\n<If it's mobile, it's going to be pretty bad.\n\n>Snow Daze\n\n<Pic 2 Related. That costed $7k US because Jewcat milked it for 3 years when he said it was \"going to be a side project that would take 6 months.\" The art isn't good and the story is even worse. OH and the voice acting as well. Waiting 6 months so he could throw that shit in.\n\nBonus Audio is also $20.\n\nYou want games? Listen up and let me say why my opinion is good with a short description + a download link\n\n>Last Sovereign\n\nDownload:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!G1djjAwS!Huxa2UuL_PsrLf4aGjxe9dmjgrhJ259Bq6IJcuI0bHk\n\nMid war event right now but if you save just after the Synod you'll be okay. Yes, there's a meeting of the Church of Ivala and it discusses things like accepting Succubi into the church, wither to help out the new chalice states and what to do about the current conflict with the Fucklord. This off the heels of the Third Arclent War which involved preparation in the first 3 chapters of the story. Point is, come for the sex if you want, stay for the world building, characters, magical mechanics and the plot, both breast and story related.\n\n>Teaching Feeling\n\n>>318654 Can find the game here: >>347082\n\nThe top seller on DLsite since 2015 and with good reason. The freaky art, Sylvie herself, the heart eyes, the way you headpat her into happiness. Ray's made enough money off of this to live comfortably yet he still creates games and still updates TF even now. He's to be commended.\n\n>1Room\n\nDownload:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!i2I2UKaR!Bw87LVePM9jik16K4ohfdd3mCcxx-OD6ExFQmZ_ureE\n\nTranslation:\n\nhttps://github.com/ManlyMarco/1room-English-Translation/releases/tag/v2.0\n\nI will go to bat for this one every time. Kinda like Teaching Feeling, missing a few things like the abundance of clothes and Ray-K's art but the art in this is really good, Yuu is cute and the story is so vanilla it's practically sweet. Preg ending unlocked in the gallery when you Nakadashi enough, which she starts liking.\n\n>A Spell for All\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!BhQCiaZB!lvg3_Q126X5StE03VkPE967IMQyWYzgrDg3znjo847k\n\nYes it uses porn actress models and it's mainly about Hypnotism. But it has this occult small town vibe that you'd only get in literature. You can move around town, use items and has a pretty good story. The current content creator on it is the person behind Slavemaker 3 before that was frozen. Play S3 as well as while it's from 2010 and therefore aged a bit, it still packs a bunch of content in the different girls you can train. Can find a torrent on the blogspot with everything, is like 8 gigs. Comes with a walkthrough before you ask.\n\nhttp://slavemaker3.blogspot.com/2015/12/slave-maker-35-release.html\n\n>Harem Hotel\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!CG5zFARQ!LT9_oHW3bSCnWjVROCir4_oOa9rGPR5Xi-I6q31Nd0k\n\nRuney makes 16k on patreon and rightly so, he's made probably the best harem game the west has seen. Has over 10k different shots taken and I only see him getting better for the foreseeable future. I will say that he did change Ashley when patreon asked him and there's no telling what would happen if/when Illusion finds out about this so grab it while you can.\n\n>Free Cities\n\n>>358235\n\nI still remember when I lost a weekend to this and 100 threads later, it's become a staple of /hgg/, even after the original creator left. You won't find a more fleshed out slave sim except for an /egg/ game or something and that's like pure text like this is anyway. I've lost countless days building my archology and tending to my slavefus.\n\n>Rogue Like\n\nLink:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!avYW3KKC!FEbbPLy7mfy4wYR_8_K4U4FEAYF6byApI--cUbyECOk\n\nModded:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!kPBiUKqR!Nz82K_rBm9HUWz3a4_RkkZfgMF70FjgtTvFpPvGYrbM\n\nThis game has been around since 2014 I think. What I like about it is Oni's art, the ability to move around and the various scenes and personalities the girls have. What is stifling development however is Oni himself. In 5 years he's only added 3 extra girls because he codes everything himself and it's pretty bad from what I've heard. Still, it's pretty neat the amount of things you can do in this. Modded is pretty dead as most of the people who took it from the threads on /htg/ to fagzone have left.\n",

Instead you buy a machine off a crazy scientist that turns any woman who enters it into a bimbo and you start a business with it. Use porn models again but is good for a quick fap and has a decent amount of content.\n\n>AAU\n\n>>294921\n\nTo be honest I haven't touched this one in years and I still have my original copy of AA2 and upgrading to AA2U would probably mean me losing all my cards. Still, the fact that the engine has been modded to reduce it's size and the card base hasn't been lost to the void means that it's a pretty good game, probably Illusions best, besides HS.\n\n>JSK\n\nList of games:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#F!vU5XkQ6C!e_9RmODitvMco1Vj6Rv6CA\n\nCommunity Guide:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Iy-zADo3to5A3kKY_oxZBHxUWIwZY3v1gOZ9wqejY8/edit#heading=h.fd38z3zvrlg\n\nIf you've been around the internet circa 2008, you've probably played JSK's flash games at some point. They are still good games in their own right. What if I told you though that he restarted making them after a long absence and that a few of them are already translated. Granted their kinda machine but thanks to the folks at ULMF, they've compiled uncensors, 100% saves and walkthroughs all in one place. Next game comes out in September.\n\nOn the fence about:\n\n>The Headmaster\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!O2AmwARb!g_9XuRtOx_mle-hWI00ZqKYGo6zAmuLMGkW9cnK-ip0\n\nFrom what I've seen, it has potential. You play as a teacher in charge of a school and discipline girls into your way of thinking. Yes, another HS flip but it has decent character writing, a good set up and a punishment system that's supposed to come in the next version.\n\n>Witch Trainer Silver Mod\n\nGame:\n\nhttps://www.akabur.com/downloads4all/wt/Witch_Trainer_1.02-win.zip\n\nMod:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!UfJAxACD!zJ9bK59C3kmEL702mVAd38s5w7H-XUJ0XXoenRFFJuA\n\nA pretty sizable mod for the game and finishing what Akabur started supposedly. I haven't played through it all so I can't really comment but development seems steady and it sure as shit adds more stuff Akabur promised when making the game.\n\n>Mythic Manor\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!njZn3SLA!PI1kMmta5R8l3YHC4nc65VqUpo7RfNhYvkHCmGMSb-w\n\nI always keep calling it Mystic Manor, due to all the mystical creatures in it. Anywho, another HS flip and kinda plays like Hotel but has it's own set of characters and opens itself up more to the world. Proper sex with Neffy supposedly so I'll have to give this another go. It's an okay game.\n\n>Four Elements Trainer\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!TBsVBK6T!jaOd_ezJ_LB0zaTAO4-IkOxnMLO7LVyadm9HCbcsVu4\n\nKorra route added recently but I'm still taking a wait and see approach to this. There's alot of content already with books 2 and 3 but again, I wanna see what the whole overarching story is like before I jump in. Is pretty good though.\n\n>Dark Magic\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!SvYB2IBC!lUeAJ8ygCmqaUMhO-NSiscgjK1VYvoG0h1D22zjm9Mo\n\nAnother HS flip but there's a decent amount of content. Play as the last man on earth after a magical apocalypse. Haven't really had a chance to play it but it seems okay.\n\n>COM3D2",

It would be like 8 gig in size however, there's apparently alot of content and he did say he'll release a version all together but I'll wait for that. Another HS flip and I haven't seen gameplay so can't really comment. Wait and see.\n\n>Haramase Simulator\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!zG4UkCJD!Tj9YPP1rlher2niagVvKgkRgDU5D2uM5orpdEcYekF0\n\nProject out of cuckchan and has been dead for awhile, but from what I hear they finally got enough people together to get another serious update on it out soon. So we'll see. It's pretty decent however, you play as a last guy a need to impregnate all the girls from various VNs which had their sprites ripped out of.\n\n>Something Trainer\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!7ewUwAYb!wIyvSh1HDnBsblb1EVp86uDuPnxPQLVCsvGPscT9By8\n\nI've played this and like it but the reason it's here is that it is a little light on content plus spelling mistakes everywhere. That being said, what makes this good is that unlike that cuck Luther in Something Unlimited, Something Trainer's Luther captures the various Heroines but the ones operating out of Glamor Slam are actresses that dress up as them, allowing patrons to have sex with a \"Heroine\" and Luther keeps the original Heroine to himself. That set up already makes this superior. Also uses assets from SU but the creators said it was okay as it's a free project.\n\n>Adam & Gaia\n\nSomething born out of fagzone. Plays a bit like CoC in that you're the last Human left on an earth like place and you're like Adam from biblical legend in that you need to have sex with the humans you come across and the various monster-girls you also encounter. Somehow manages to blend 2D and 3D together.\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!T7oCDIwS!a_xXNdRhuUQlFrvgUQtSBzyLb5J0ch4XgkPpoNokmUc\n\nYes, I have particular tastes and yes some of these are HS flips/3D porn but it's what I like and I guaran fucking tee that they're better than alot of stuff that gets released these days.\n\nThe only thing decent I found decent in this thread was this.",

It's a short flash game, you basically need to build a brothel from scratch. Unlike most other brothel management games where you manage the girl instead of the brothel itself, in this game the girls are nothing more than disposable cattle. Once they break you can get rid of them until the end game where it's actually cheaper to fix them just for them to go broken again.\n\nThe game is short to a fault and have a few animations, but still remains as the best brothel management for the sole reason that you are actually managing a brothel instead of the whores themselves.\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!9YwBzJhY!g_NFviFgJNf0PMyVkNcYVipZcQRnTrx1ZHPJz5sGbHA\n\n>Eroico\n\nA platformer where you play as a shota knight in his way to fight the demon lord. It's sadly a lose get sex scene, however, the platforming and combat, specially with bosses, is solid, there are some secrets to find and when you defeat an enemy, the enemy gets added to your gallery, so losing to them is not encouraged.\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!kZwkmQCR!Z49QkFk2wL-Duvnstm_pyoZbDadT8iCrKf8qon4GTDk\n\n>Forest of the Blue Skin\n\nA platformer like Eroico, with the twist that the whole point is capturing the monster girls you face, and you have to be clever with it, using your abilities or defeating them in specific ways.\n\nhttps://ux.getuploader.com/fobs3/\n\nPassword for download: fobs08608\n\n>What if Adventure Time was a 3D Anime?\n\nOne of the best ones gameplaywise even if it isn't hentai on itself, it has nudity and a gallery for models. Also, the dev is a sellout so later versions are censored, here's a link to the last good version, 7.5.\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!4M5kAKhK!3LWROBziBMZbC-L19J1nD-rjzySKq2uklflbecRsTkA",

It drops below half, retreat to Defensive stance before you get tackled.\n\n∙ If you catch an enemy on the ground, Crushing Blow may do more damage than Tempo Attack. (Hover over it to make sure, though).\n\n∙ Before entering a fight, remember to make sure your health is full and check for any negative status effects.",

Let her screw you for a free perk point or let her take some life from you and you get a free willpoint. It would be great if everytime you meet them they'll remember which choice you picked last time and if you picked too many of X or Y choice it'll result in either an ending or her leaving forever.\n\n>Slime.\n\nsame dialogue and set of choices everytime you meet them that ultimately don't matter. Would be pretty neat if you can get her to join your party.\n\n>Wasp.\n\nsame issue as slime. Easy solution would be in expanding on her encounter so it's kinda like the centaurs but this time you can return after getting the 'ending' of sorts.\n\n>Angel.\n\nA onetime event which leads to you unlocking a pretty pointless fast travel. This encounter either needs to completely change or be expanded on so it'll affect other encounters like Merrybell or the Quetzal.\n\n>Dryad.\n\nFree food with no repercussions for abusing it. Just make a punishment ending for abusing their kindness to often, like a game over where hiro is forever stick between two \"trees\" of sorts.\n\n>Cultist.\n\nAbit more events but it ultimately leads to nowhere unless you visit 1 random building in the middle of nowhere. It would be great if you could end up getting pulled outta the golden pig by the dark god and having to spend the rest of your life in her domain or maybe have it so she'll help you get rid of gods in the region.\n\n>Giantess (Goddess?)\n\nOn a completely optional side of the world that's entirely skippable with the whole region that's quite pointless to even visit. You should be able to become the pope for her religion which would grant you a free bed and a discounted marketplace in the town near her on that map.",

			"body": "1. More actual fetish content. 99% of the sex content in the game is just regular ol' sex stuff, which is kinda funky in a world full of furries and demons. Maybe tie in some of the magical shenanigans to fetishes, like getting spells to force your opponent to overproduce a fluid suddenly, or summoning girly clothes on a masculine man. Maybe something like a spell to make the opponent's clothing transparent, to trigger their exposed debuff?\n\n2. Less story stuff, more areas. I'm personally not interested in the storyline or the setting. The city and most of the characters are a drag, give us somewhere else to go. Like, holy fuck, I thought this city was going to be one of many locations to visit a year ago, but damn, it looks like the dev wants the city to be /the/ setting for the game.\n\n3. Stop making new races and sub-races, at least until we have a bunch of new (NON-CITY) places to go.\n\n4. I'm doubling down on it: more fetishes/kinks, or fill out the current ones. This game's sex is WAY too vanilla overall. Spice it up, even if it means tossing in a couple weird Furaffinity-tier fetishes, or adding extreme versions of the ones already in the game.\n\n5. Flesh out the transformation system so more of the changes are actually meaningful and not just changing a footnote in the selfie menu.\n\n6. Less focus on clothing, weapons and equipment for a while. Although having more clothing /do/ stuff would be nice, like having \"pushup\" tops/bras that push your character's breasts up to give them a seduction buff but a mobility/speed/AP debuff, or whatever.\n\n7. Less focus on prebuilt NPCs, more content for the randomized NPCs.",

Willpower helps the PC resist being disabled by pain and orgasm. The update also includes a large contribution by bsin that makes improvements to the town's streets, the homes on Danube street, and the school.\n\n>Edit: Updated links to 0.1.32.1, which fixes a bug that prevented audiences from functioning.\n\n>Edit 2: Updated links to 0.1.32.2, which fixes a handful of bugs and adds art for different penis sizes to the sidebar sprite.\n\n>Patch Notes\n\n>You can now choose a tiny, small or normal sized penis for male player characters at the game's start. Existing characters default to normal. Different sizes are not yet represented by art.\n\n>Parasites and very low purity can increase penis size. Surgery can increase or reduce penis size. Penis size can increase up to enormous.\n\n>Added max player penis size option to the settings page, and penis size to the cheat menu.\n\n>NPCs may struggle to fit larger sizes.\n\n>Added and updated NPC comments and reactions to take penis size into account.\n\n>NPC comments may now cause your character to develop insecurities about their breasts or penis if they're particularly small or large. Insecurities increase stress and reduce control when agitated. The effect worsens as the insecurity does.\n\n>Added the Willpower characteristic. Characters with high willpower can resist being disabled by pain and can recover faster from orgasms.\n\n>Added the \"Pray\" option to the temple, and the \"Meditate\" option to the fishing rock at the lake. Prayer effectiveness is determined by purity. Meditation effectiveness is determined by willpower.\n\n>Collecting enough different antiques for the museum will now prompt Winter to ask you for further assistance.\n\n>Thanks to bsin for the following additions and improvements:\n\n>Defiant/submissive characters now react differently to catcalling.\n\n>Improved the street underwear selling event. High fame exhibitionist characters may be asked for lewd photos instead, and the NPC may have different demands by night. Also added more NPC commentary on your state/fame/appearance.\n\n>Added an event to the town's streets where an exposed PC witnesses another NPC being attacked. Intervention is risky.\n\n>Improved the tea, party, and garden events when working on Danube street.\n\n>Added a new tutor event to working on Danube Street.\n\n>Added a number of new skulduggery events to burglary on Danube Street.\n\n>Teachers will now send you to Leighton if you try to attend their class with your arms bound.\n\n>Added a number of \"safe\" events to maths, history and science.\n\n>Added more reactivity to the PC's state to several school events.\n\n>Balance Changes\n\n>NPC comments on your breasts should now better match your size.",

It's basically a character sprite mod to change the character sprite model in the top left. Couple of things first, I'm not even sure it correctly changes all clothing to match the character but it seems to change most at least. Second, this only affects the character sprite in the top left, not the ones shown during encounters. Also, I'm not one of the ones who made this. You can thank a couple artists on Discord for putting this together, I just collected the downloads and tossed everything into my \"img\" folder for ease of use. I'm also including a second download that's an alternative to the PJ uppers which is closer to the original long sleeve. The one already in the image folder is one that makes the upper look more like spaghetti straps. Just drop the img folder into the game folder and let it override. For the alternative PJ's, just unpack it and place the contents in img/upperclothes AFTER applying the first download. You need both or the first at least. Again, let it override if it asks you, which it should. You can't have both versions of PJ uppers as the mod only changes visuals, not what or how many clothes exist.\n\nMod (Spaghetti Strap PJs) : https://mega.nz/#!NxZxRKLI!xeF3Afr54pv8FLdGY7d1GqE45BvnIu8v3cu3kCMJHrQ\n\nAlternative PJs : https://mega.nz/#!o5BzzI7a!prSin6cwj9ILQc_2J3rsWlhqox73a4N3e2HHNxCFTKg\n\nOne more time, you need at least the first link. Unpack, drop contents into the game folder where \"img\" folder is located, and let it override. If you want the long sleeve PJs, you'll need to unpack that one in img/upperclothes afterwards. And, also again, I'm neither the kind souls that made these edits, just someone getting them from Discord and bringing them here.\n",

			"body": "Foreword: TES series possesses an uncanny quality. It manages to draw so many adult modders to it and it’s no doubt that Bethesda has benefited immensely from this franchise quite possibly being the greatest unintentional adult gaming franchise. Although Daggerfall foreshadowed this. Because of this, /hgg/ deservedly needs a recurring thread with helpful information that encompasses TES games. The uncanny nature of TES Adult Modding in turn means that TES mod threads can easily be the cornerstone of this board without even trying.\n\nFor now, this Edition will begin by focusing on Skyrim. Feel free to talk about lewd modding other TES games and share advice. Note:' If you want SSE, check the second from bottom link and decide based on your fetishes and what’s available. Then start from here but go to associated SSE links. Most mods for LE have SSE equivalents. Note 2: If you absolutely need loli and shota, skip to the bottom of this and start there first.\n\nGetting Started\n\nGo to: https://www.tesgeneral.com/\n\n< But I don’t want to install a gorillion mods! I just want to fap!\n\nYou don’t have to install every recommended mod on there per category. The section you should pay the most attention to is, Essentials. You should want to crashproof your game as best as possible. Many mods listed there are prerequisites that most other mods use. This especially applies to lewd mods.\n\nProtip: DO NOT USE NEXUS MOD MANAGER\n\nDO NOT USE VORTEX\n\n>buying skyrim\n\nIgnore all advice insisting that neglecting those causes issues.\n\n> I got the essentials setup, now what?\n\nGo to: http://loverslab.com/\n\n< But the site is not loading at all!\n\nYou better hope it’s not down for good. Give it a minute. It has been having problems lately. Loverslab has nearly every lewd mod for Oblivion, Skyrim, and SSE. This is your new home.\n\n1. Go to: http://www.loverslab.com/topic/19588-sexlab-index/\n\n1.A. Doublecheck Required Files For All Plugins to make sure you didn’t skip any listed in Essentials\n\n1.B. Install Sexlab Framework\n\n2. Go to: https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2476-all-in-one-hdt-animated-pussy/ - this gets you not just the bare minimum but quite possibly everything you will need aside from Sexlab.\n\nNote: AIO HDT AP gets you started, but it is its own style and setup, so to speak. Once you get your footing, you might find some things you wish it didn’t use due to compatibility or personal preference. It is however an amazing all-in-one pack. You might end up not changing a thing.\n\n3. Go back to Sexlab Index in #1, start shopping for plugins that fit your kinks.\n\n4. Start browsing the forums. Not everything is listed in Sexlab Index, from mods to animation packs. Consider the Skyrim Adult Mods sub-forum or Sexlab Downloads sub-forum your next stop.\n\nProtip: Test out a handful of mods at a time, especially ones you’re unsure are working or depend on others. If you use an Alternate Start type mod (bypasses the long intro), this will help speed you along.\n\n> I got my mods setup, is there anything else I should add?\n\nIf you're just lewd modding, you're done. If you plan on playing + lewd modding, figure out what you need to compliment your lewd mods. If your PC can handle it, view the recommended ENBs.\n\n> gib modpack pls\n\nMaybe someone down the line will make one, but keep in mind that the gargantuan size of modded skyrim can easily be 100GB. You might find that a modpack will center around a fetish that’s not yours. All general issues with modpacks apply.\n\n> but SSE?\n\nSSE modding either has everything you want from LE, or almost everything. For Lewd modding, check here. If your fetish is still stuck in LE, don’t give up. Follow conversion tips or instructions:\n\nhttps://www.loverslab.com/topic/94228-sse-conversion-tracking-apr-23-3336/\n\n> gimme loli/shota\n\nVisit our friends at the ATF. Choose LE and SSE based on what’s available and your preferences. This is your new home.\n\nhttps://allthefallen.ninja/forum/index.php?threads/beginners-guide-to-skyrim-modding.37/\n\nhttps://allthefallen.ninja/forum/index.php?threads/shota-loli-guide-and-resources-for-skykids.2696/\n\nhttps://mods.allthefallen.ninja/index.php?title=Mod_Master_List\n\nWhy the extra work? Loverslab explicitly blocked child interactions in the Sexlab framework. Any questions related to loli or shota is a question for the ATF. The ATF chose version 1.59c as its base version. This means that some Loverslab mods meant for 1.62b will not work with it.\n\nPotentially useful historical note: https://archive.fo/Ucvyj [lolicon.legacywaste.org snapshot]\n\nPersonally untested, but the owner of legacywaste has a still live link to an unblocked Sexlab version 1.61b",

Using this approach in Vortex would have the following drawbacks:\n\n>… (bullet points)\n\n>This is not to say that using VFS is worse or bad, simply that Vortex did not opt for this as a default deployment method.\n\nBasically a VFS worked well with Bethesda's Gamebryo. Vortex supports other games that of course doesn't use Gamebryo, so no VFS. Whoever took over Mod Manager is doing an amazing job.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you're modding a game with nexusmods & vortex support, and there's no community mod manager available, Vortex is better than nothing.",

			"body": "It should be pretty obvious.\n\nNow, some mods shouldn't require \"testing\" - really basic stuff like the unofficial patches. Those are well developed, well tested, etc. I consider them \"safe\".\n\nSo you get your basic install set up, which is more or less the mods/tools listed on https://www.tesgeneral.com/essential-se\n\nIf you have the slightest idea what you're doing, you can't fuck that stuff up.\n\nAssuming you're on a stable computer, now you have a working base install that's pretty stable. Maybe you play test it, just in case, and verify that you can, say, reach Whiterun without anything going weird or crashing.\n\nThen you get to business - install a mod or two using MM2. Check if those mods work correctly, to the best of your ability. Do the mods actually do what they say they'll do? Does the game crash? Etc. The more features you use from the mods you're testing, the better, but there's a point of diminishing returns where you're just getting paranoid. The bigger or more complex or intrusive (meaning, the more deeply it fucks with things) the mod is, the more you need to test it.\n\nIf everything seems good, you mark those mods off as \"probably good\" and install some new ones. This time, your job is more complicated. There may be conflicts between the mods (there are tools that you can use to check for that) and if there are conflicts, you may need to find (or create) patches that resolve those conflicts. Then you need to test the content of the new mods, and probably do a quick test of the old mods to verify that they seem to be working correctly as well.\n\nKeep doing that - installing new mods, checking for conflicts, and testing old/new content - until you're satisfied with your gameplay experience and are ready to play.\n\nIf you find problems, you need to verify which mod(s) are causing problems. Basically that means (assuming you're doing >1 new mod at a time) turning off all your new shit and trying out the new (unverified) mods one at a time until you find the one(s) (there might be more than one) that are causing problems. If you can do without them, just disable them. It's easier than fixing them - though I would search around to see if it's a known conflict and if any workarounds or compatibility patches exist. Many larger or better supported mods have patches to make them work with each other. If you can't live without it, and there are no patches, you'll have to fix it yourself. Good luck!\n\nNote that some problems take a long time to manifest, so you can't really consider anything safe until you've spent a lot of time using it. If you understand modding and what different mods do, you can really narrow that down…. a mod that just tunes game settings is gonna be a LOT less likely to cause problems than a mod that does heavy script, for example. Mods that are just graphics and animations rarely cause persistent problems, and usually either crash, have visual anomalies, or are fine. It's kind of a thing you pick up as you go along. Anyway, just because something appeared to work, doesn't mean it does work. You may encounter CTDs under specific circumstances, for example, but if you're thorough and persistent you can eventually get the game to a working state. Usually, fewer mods are better than more, though with lewd gaming you usually need quite a lot to actually get anything worth playing/fapping to.\n",

It gets surprisingly detailed when you throw in different traits, varying body sizes, magical mutations, blessings and so on.\n\nAt the start of the game, you're tasked to pay off a debt and are locked with just two species, lamias and harpies. They both have a few different subspecies peppered in them, but until you're debt free, those are your only options. You can also buy toys to use on your slaves, thus spicing up the training a little.\n\nIf the mating is too complicated for you, or if you feel like giving a more simpler approcach a try, you can turn on simple mating in the Config.ini.\n\nDownloads\n\nDLsite: http://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=/product_id/RJ222368.html\n\nTranslated and modded version 8.4: https://mega.nz/#!ql83EagB!l9p9KtOC7alJPsTPXiRoIK8y_aGuzHQ0rE-AR_8-xXg\n\nManuals\n\n(they are also all in the game folder)\n\nSlave Matrix Manual: https://pastebin.com/Q6v0LKyx\n\nSM Mod Readme: https://pastebin.com/FSpUWtdR\n\nAutoHotkey script for mouse scroll: https://pastebin.com/2LC6kVVY\n\nCheat Engine note:\n\nMoney is stored as 8 bytes variable, for everything else:\n\n1.

It hardly looks like a tree thanks to all the incest though.\n\nThe final product technically qualifies for what I was going for but needs some tweaks. The wings should be made white and the skin could be a bit fairer. I think the snake tongue gives it character so I'm fine with it. In the end our \"angel\" is actually 65.625% Human, 12.5% Elf, 12.5% Echidna, and 9.375% Lamia. All the human part being one person's DNA… This is the Charles II of monster girls.\n\nThe union between \"High elf\" and \"Pseudo-Angel attempt 2\" in this picture also produced this elf-eared mix with Abnormal Skin 000. Reminds me of a Drow. Maybe I'll breed this with the final angel product to make some kind of fallen angel. Or see if I can make it have red eyes and make a Dunmer.\n\nI stopped jerking off hours ago… What has science done?",

			"body": "tl;dr - Split into two parts: first part scheduled for May 15; second part to pair with 7F.\n\nI hate to keep pushing back a release specifically intended to tide-over a different release being constantly pushed back, but I've basically run into a similar situation as Bo with 7F in that alternative, more ambitious approaches to content I had planned/expected to be simple keep coming up, and I'm not willing to ignore them for the sake of expediency. The compromise is to split the update so that you can get some juicy stuff (plus the \"system\" changes) prior to 7F so that you don't have to muck around with any of that for 7F.\n\nPart 1 will contain the new content for Karen, Lily, Cobra, and Scarlett\n\nPart 2 will contain the new content for Miss Claus, Khulan, Eliza, and Yvonne\n\nAs mentioned before, it will be recommended to start a new/clean/fresh save for Part 1. It won't be required (except for Karen, if she's gone in your save), the content just won't flow as well if you don't.\n\nFor people worried about having to constantly restart the game, 7F itself won't need to as far as I know.\n\nSee below (light spoiler warning) for some specific examples of the nature of the delay.\n\nAs most people have noticed, talking to a Mistress wearing Puppy Gear yields a flavor scene. Many people have understandably been requesting one for Lily and I planned to oblige in this update. However, after I finished writing it, I thought of a follow-up. Then another. Then another. Then another. And then I thought having every arc be a rule-of-three of escalating scenes was maybe getting predictable and decided to add some complicating factors. As a result, Lily's puppy content is now more involved than I planned Khulan's entire content to be, which a) eats into Khulan's time and b) makes me feel bad for Khulan and want to write more for her too when I get the chance/inspiration. And that was supposed to be Lily's one-off cute puppy scene. Her \"actual\" update is all the post-apprentice stuff. And ultimately the other ladies are no different.\n\nAn unrelated diversion came in the form of a new portrait CG Bo was helping me with. It was meant to add a simple extra expression to the MC's repertoire, but I felt it had more potential and ending up spending a bunch of time making variations and adjustments. I feel the result adds a new dimension to the MC's portrait-usage (and forms a nice basis for a dynamic portrait system I'd like to add a few floors down the line), but it's definitely not something my original release estimate(s) accounted for.\n\nThanks as always for everyone's patience and support. I hope you'll find what I'm adding to be worth the wait in it's own right (not to mention 7F hopefully soon after).\n",

I was a salty butt hurt doubter for not trusting them but they really made me eat my words with this release!\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1_1LkByGBwoQHKzKDaHPEoqLwsXanIiJm/view?usp=sharing\n\nI'm joking of course. After 5 months and over $10,000 of funding here we have the release meant to 'assure' us they are working hard.\n\nIt's 2.5 scenes for Cobra using primary old assets, and a naked sprite for ethan. That's it. No seriously that is it- this isn't another joke.\n\nIt was like pulling fucking teeth to get Koda to release this and THIS is what we get. But I think it shows us just why it is taking so long.\n\nOverreach/delusions of Grandeur.\n\nYou see if you play the cobra update you'll look at it and go WOW so many options added, but then you click and you get -NOT YET IMPLEMENTED NOT YET IMPLEMENTED NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. For all of them.\n\nForgive me for assuming but I think Koda and Bo spent the last four months jacking off to all the great ideas they can add to the game and after they had milked enough patron money they tried to implement them.\n\nOnly to then realize that 'oh shit these ideas are not physically possible to add to a game, let alone one made with rpg maker ace. And this 'update' is what they managed to scrounge together after delaying the 24 hour timer for a third time.\n\nAnd you want to know the saddest part of all this is? Reading this entire butt hurt rant I wrote will take you longer then playing the entire update.",

(One of the NPCs alludes to begging for mercy as a mechanic with her, but I haven't found out a way to. Probably unfinished)\n\nOther NPCs were added that have dialogue that changes based on how submissive you are and have a couple of interactions (Text only though)\n\nThe balance is out of whack though and the fights are too easy along with becoming stronger being a trivial task.",

I just came on here to ask if anybody had any questions about the Pastebins or if they found problems that I should worry about.\n\nI haven't been keeping up as much with the patches lately, mainly due to just regular life things, ya know? I always try to get on every once in a while to update the Pastebins, but the time between updates is getting longer and longer each time.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is that I'm totally disposable. I'm nobody special I just had too much time on my hands. If I stop updating, anybody could just copy the contents into a new Pastebin for them to manage and keep sharing it with y'all (they'll surely be more competent about it than I was).\n\nHopefully I've been of use to y'all, even though I kinda sucked at keeping things organized for a while now. If anybody has questions or suggestions then just reply to this post. As always, I'll link the Pastebins here.\n\nTABA\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/hViJmZkF\n\nRPGX\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/yAMWVwjc",

			"body": "Well lads, today is the day of the alleged TABA shutdown.. Had to see the game for one last time before it allegedly gets lenny'd round the back of the shed by RPGx. A couple of things that I hope they bring across from TABA;\n\n- Some of the art/characters are amazing.. Missed opportunity if at least a few more don't get ported over.. Makes sense too, but who can say for sure what happens from here.. Hopefully they DO make use of the resources they already have.\n\n- Gacha rates in TABA are beyond terrible. Glad they kinda fixed this in RPGx by having gachas more infrequent, but more profitable in the long run. That said, I'm sure most here who've been playing the game a total of about 100 hours or more might already have a full deck of level 100 LRs, so maybe they need to add another two Card tiers to make up for this.. Right now it's way too easy to get the top rated cards.\n\n- I hope the PVP they bring to RPGx will be exciting. I'm just glad we've evolved beyond the 'click to continue' stage\n\nCan't think of much else beyond that.. Drawing a blank. The whole experience feels more than a little surreal, but I can only hope they bring the energy from TABA over to RPGx. And that faggot who made the RPG style webms from years gone can finally step up too. It's been a hell of a ride.. Godspeed you magnificent bastards. I won't miss the fucking shitty gachas though\n",

I can be a little unorganized at times…\n\nFirst you're gonna want to download the Perfect Viewer (c1 - c1008) (ENG + JP) found all the way at the bottom of the pastebin.\n\nAfter this, you gotta get caught up on the JP scenes, since they go up to 1018 now instead of 1008. Use these links and add them to your viewer.\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!1gsmDYpQ!0zj-CnzWWO_8_gqt6x5DSyal7EENJCtR8UJN78GLiCs\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!ryZkFA5R!6KkZngkxDSsGO-thcy0-evr9Wd4MZLVOyglopT_hV7M\n\nAfter getting caught up on the JP scenes, you're gonna want to get caught up on the English scenes. I have attached an image of the files you will need to download from this folder:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#F!s0UVRaaT!bIKrgsTPumbDLdEFDb11hQ\n\nAfter you have these downloaded and added to your viewer, you're gonna want to download all patches under the English Viewer Patches not in Folder Above (in the Pastebin). Add these to viewer.\n\nYou should be done at that point. Hopefully this helps. If it doesn't then oh well",

			"body": "Thread #2, since the previous thread hit the reply limit of 750 posts.\n\nHello. I am the creator of Kobold Adventure, a textual choose your own adventure game with illustrations and audio. Basically, you play as a kobold in a medieval fantasy world in which pretty much everyone hates kobolds. Depending on your choices, you may end up raping, killing, stealing, being raped, being killed, having consensual sex, getting enslaved, falling down a well or just struggling to get by while maintaining your purity and your sanity both.\n\nThe game is actively being developed with (at least) one update every two weeks. There is over 550 000 words of content already, although it is nowhere near completion. Full scene trees containing all options available can be found via the aMap feature in the game's menu. The development team consists of my artist and I, although fan contributions are always gratefully accepted, and I am slowly looking to expand the core development team. To learn more about contributing, check the contribution page of the game itself.\n\nKobold Adventure contains blatant furry content as well as humans and a variety fantasy races. The tone of most encounters is pretty dark. You probably shouldn't play it if you can't stand filth, blood, death, bestiality or oppressive sadness permeating from constantly being at the bottom of the food chain.\n\nThe game can be played online at http://koboldadventure.com/\n\nThe latest version for offline play (2.4.7) can be found at http://koboldadventure.com/download/packages/Kobold%20Adventure%202.4.7.zip (although this is bound to change as early as next week)\n\nOlder packages may also be downloaded http://koboldadventure.com/download/index.html\n\nNote that offline versions are often one step behind the online version, and may lack the latest bugfixes or typo-corrections pushed to the live website.\n\nThis thread serves to discuss the game, to provide feedback to me, to rouse interest, to tell me what you want to see (m",

This event may be a prerequisite for later (involves Ilmeia).\n\n=Bandit Fort=\n\n>Obtain information regarding the bandit-extermination efforts from the capital city bar, and head to the newly revealed barracks and do some sidequesting.\n\n>After a while, the commander should inform you that they have discovered the enemy's base, and is organizing a large scale attack. Accept the request when you're ready.\n\n>Team up with Kurumi and carve your way through the dungeon, getting every single piece of loot you can get. One of them should be a memo containing seemingly random numbers; this will be important later.\n\n=Cult infiltration=\n\n>Not sure when, but after some time entering the port city warriors' guild should have someone approach you with a request; accept, and follow through the event (involves Ilmeia and Iriza).

By the way, accepting the job offer from the alchemist also gives you an item that allows you to pretty much prostitute yourself to random town NPCs.\n\n>Not sure how this event progresses later on.",

This event is likely a prerequisite for later. (Pre-requisite to Helior's questline. The old book you get triggers an event when you go to the port city.)\n\n=Otherworld=\n\n>Probable prerequisites: may need to have progressed Ilmeria and Helior's questlines some, must have finished the Succubus resurrection and Dilapidated Mansion events.\n\n>Sleep in the northwest village inn. If all the flags are right, you should automatically wake up to a nightmarish version of your room. Make your preparations and exit the room into an eldritch dungeon. Fortunately, time is temporarily stopped here. Clear the dungeon and return to your usual world. This event is likely a prerequisite for later (involves Ilmeia, Helior and the succubus).

She said something about the otherworld being their home world.)\n\n=Rita (red-haired twintailed girl)'s questline=\n\n>Meet her in the western plains (south area)\n\n>Meet her in the port city's warriors' guild, unlock the (south)west cave\n\n>Head to the aforementioned cave, speak to her, party up and clear the dungeon (note: patch notes imply that if you trigger her 'retreat' passive by dipping to red HP around this area something breaks, so you probably should clear this first go).\n\n>Head to the southwest town, to the innermost building, and enter the long line of people; she should be there, right before you. Progress scene.\n\n>Make your way to the northwest village; you should see her in one of the buildings undertaking a request in the northwest forest.\n\n>Follow her to the northwest forest (high danger level; beware of ridiculously fast green ropers), rescue her, and make your way to the end. Watch the scene.\n\n>Return to the northwest village, and watch her complete her quest.\n\n>Not sure if there's any continuation after this, but from now on you can see her in the port city warriors' guild, available for recruiting. She's probably better than the mercenary you can recruit for 50g. Probably. At least she's free.\n\n=Kurumi (oni miko samurai girl)'s questline=\n\n>Meet her in the western plains (south area)\n\n>Finish the Bandit Fort event\n\n>Meet her in the port city bar\n\n>Meet her in the cave east of the port city (danger level 2)\n\n>Make your way beyond the northwest forest to the place with the orb thing and see her there\n\n>Make your way through the labyrinth ruins north of the desert city (danger level 5, stupidly long dungeon. Be prepared.) and enter a strange room with a large statue and 5 smaller statues side by side.\n\n>Interact with the statues according to the order given to you by the memo (so 5 1 3 2 4 for example means that you need to interact with the statues in the order of 5th, 1st, 3rd, 2nd, 4th). If you do it right a treasure should appear. Loot it. (To further elaborate, the above example means that you should interact with the 2nd statue from the left, 4th statue from the left, middle statue, right-most statue, left-most statue.)\n\n>Talk to her in the port city bar and show her the treasure. Talk to her again when you're ready, to be transported into what's probably one of the most difficult dungeons in the entire game alongside her. Time is temporarily stopped while you're with her, fortunately. Clearing the dungeon ends the questline and awards a Rainbow Crystal, a necessary ingredient in upgrading your weapon one last time into its final form, Sylpheed.",

Leave, and watch another appearance of a thieving succubus. Pursue the succubus to the end of the dungeon. Watch the event.\n\n>After this, she should be always visible in the capital city church, where you can ask her about her stolen pendant.

Suffice to say, I got every single one of these games for free using nothing but google searches, so as long as you aren't as mentally deficient as cuckfag you should be able to find them yourself.\n\n——-\n\nFirst up: セイナルモノヘ or RJ132648. A platformer game about 2hus or something, the entire thing's in japanese so I can't tell what the fuck the story is. That being said, the sprites are great, with a ton of variety for monsters and a gallery mode as well. The gameplay is metroidvania without being obnoxious like another recently-released game I could mention, with the player organically unlocking powers that allow access to more areas which let you find upgrades to more areas. The circle also releases the CGs in a separate folder, and they're worth a look. But of course they're locked behind passwords so go to ulmf or something to find them.\n",

This being an old h-game, the story's basically non-existent. You're a schoolgirl who falls into rape hell or something. That being said, it has some of the tightest platforming controls I remember from an hgame, and it calls upon you to use those skills too. The gallery is also clever too: instead of forcing you to lose to monsters to collect the scenes, the gallery is a separate level, and each monster is locked behind a destructible wall. You naturally unlocks the spells to destroy each wall through playing the game. Fair warning though, this game is old as fuck, so trying to find a full save file could be awful.",

The reason I'm censoring the title is because the developer is western, or at least very fluent in english, so if I use the title he might stumble onto the thread and make a stink. It's a 2d survival horror, kind of reminds me of that one hentai resident evil game that never got made properly. You have to scavenge around for bullets and conserve ammo while at the same time neding to find creative ways to fend off hordes of rapey plant-zombies. Great for people who like that kind of thing, although I'm not one of those people so I just used the infinite bullets cheat. Sprites are fantastic and varied, although the \"every enemy is a plant monster\" thing kind of dampens that. Still worth a look.",

The hentai scenes themselves are also basically just better versions of MaiDenSnow/Dungeons&Prisoners. It shows the character, it shows the monster, and it has internal view as well.

I'm guessing most people paying vague attention to the hentai game scene heard about this coming out a few months back, and I'm confident in saying there isn't a single hentai game out there with better art than this.

There is no problem even if you skip.\n\n>Progression 0: The first week.\n\nChat to and Listen to Yuu about her problems three times and believe in the Yuu that believes in You.\n\n\"Go to the station (LP100)\" on the last day. You will see her again, and she'll come back with you to your apartment.\n\n>Progress 1: Endless rush\n\nRepeat this twice because an event occurs when you return from the shop.\n\nAfter you buy the \"Hard Technical Book\" Yuu will get interested in programming. Buy her the \"Easy Technical Book\"\n\nEvery time the date changes, Yuu's programming increases by 1 as long as you have the “simple technical book”.\n\n\"Working\" when Yuu's skill is 4 or more causes Yuu to help with the work\n\nAn event will occur during the next day, and Sunday will be rested (?)\n\nProgression 2: Favorability 80 or more\n\nBuy \"Clothing for somewhere else\" and invite to a date on a holiday (LP 200) (Scene 04-05) ※ Be careful because it does not occur if Yuu is a virgin\n\nProgression 3: Lover relationship\n\nH will not be denied even if Yuu is not prepared with contraception\n\nThe BGM of the room changes. Most features are unlocked\n\nUnlock all body positions except for laterality (unclear, likely prone). Buy the latest career change guide\n\nThe epilogue (scene 14) is unlocked when the date is changed\n\nProgression degree 4: 120 or more\n\nReaction to room sex increases\n\nHairstyle\n\nTwo ties: Speak to Yuu in the morning and she should eventually explain her School's dress code.\n\nPonytail: If you take a bath when the degree of progress is 1 or more, Yuu has a ponytail on the third turn. Speak with her then to unlock it.\n\nPosition\n\nProne: choose \"from behind\" when Yuu is on the bed\n\nDoggy: Friday night on or after progress 1. If you have two or more condoms, check out the gym dressing bag at the bottom right of the room (Scene 03)\n\nBreaking Matsuba (1 leg up?): Afterpills (chamomile, I think) or after the first date, attack Yuu (scene 08)\n\nMasturbation: make Yuu frustrated and return home with the second choice of a peep event after a bath (scene 09-11)\n\nCowgirl: Ask for a date after obtaining micro bikini (LP 200) (scene 12)\n\nBackwards cowgirl: Use exercise clothes after getting cowgirl, or check exercise clothes bag and get Yuu to put them on\n\nTemporal (sideways): Get all body positions other than progress 4 & laterality (prone?)\n\nOther\n\nPhysical Education Sitting (fetal position?): Click on Yuu's uniform skirt while sitting or the hem of the Y-shirt\n\nHow to put Yuu to sleep\n\nDrink coffee and act up to the 9th turn, or let chamomile drink after the 4th turn",

Be careful because Yuu is a virgin; it's difficult to make her cum normally, but it's impossible if it's only been a few days after her defloration (ime, it takes about 3-4 days, and the last heart can be filled by toying with her clit, but it might be different for you. Play around and see what works)\n\nsensitivity\n\nBasically, playing with a part of Yuu's body increases it's sensitivity.\n\nThe clitoris and vagina are two different parts - playing with the exterior increases clit sense, while fingering Yuu increases vaginal sensitivity.\n\nSorry if I made any mistakes, but even the Google Translate version was barely legible, and I couldn't find an english guide.

Tbh, it's already very playable, even the story can be understood. I didn't spot any complex kanjis confusing Google or Bing. If you need a guide, you can check this one out :\n\nhttps://ulmf.org/threads/rpgmakermvgame-hook-patcher-how-to-hook-rpg-maker-mv-games.8960\n\nFinally, really recommend to play it on harder difficulties, to get the good feelz once your party reaches an underground camp after finishing a level. With torches, trapped chests, locked doors and no enforced grind, it's rather satisfying. Also, don't forget to use the neko with her handy mapping skill since there is no mini-map.\n\nNot saying this game is groundbreaking (not as perfect as MaidenSnow for example), but decent H-games that are actually worth playing as fucking *games* are so rare nowadays that I had to mention it.

			"body": "I know about the premature optimization specially with regards to memory usage, but really… it's not something you should concern yourself with unless you are targetting toasters for reals. You're probably doing this as a hobby, so you can optimize when you feel like it and stuff, but 500mb memory is far too low. I use a smart toaster from 2011 and I currently have 6gb free. I don't even remember the last time I saw notebooks being sold with less than 4gb memory.\n\nYou should wait until the game is closer to how it should end up before you worry about these kinds of things. Maybe you're worrying about memory, but what will have toasters screaming is the 3d itself - a lot of 3d h-games run bad on anything that isn't the best GPU available on the market, due to the \"artist\" using every single shader possible to hide the fact that their art is shit, on top of models with no optimization whatsoever.\n\nBut like the other anon said, 500mb memory usage is irrelevant unless you're targeting literal toasters, and if you were targeting literal toasters you'd probably want to drop the 3d entirely as well. I know that when developing as a hobby we feel like we should optimize every single thing, it's part of the fun, but if you do this with everything you will never move forward. Try to stick to certain goals. For instance, on my project I want the turn processing (heaviest part of my game) to finish processing a turn in less than 150ms even on smartphones (currently sitting at ~40ms on phones and < 10ms on desktops). I didn't optimize the turn processing fully because it's too soon to do that, but I kept a list of annoying optimizations that can be done later. You could perhaps do the same to scratch your itch for the memory usage, just write down what can be done to improve it and try to make the game work with future changes going in that direction, so that if push comes to shove you don't have to rewrite the whole thing to optimize it.",

For instance, I decided not to use Enigma VB on my project, because all it does is make the files neat, but it multiplies the memory usage about 6 times. In this case, the benefits don't outweight the negatives.\n\n> lilithsthrone is 500mb at runtime, and is slow at times, and its a fucking text game\n\nIn general, text games run slowly either because 1) They use a suboptimize environment to develop it (Twine, Inform, etc); or 2) The dev doesn't actually know how to code. Usually, it's both (as seen by the multiple Twine games that also run like dogshit). Generally, these makers are meant for very simple games, so they are \"optimized\" for games like those, and making anything else with them will suffer.\n\nTake Trap Quest for instance. The game runs like dogshit. Does it have to run like dogshit? It doesn't do anything particularly amazing. Inform under Git can handle 30 FPS animations with multiple images, and that's mostly a limitation of the timer, so it might even be possible to go over this with a lower-level implementation, so the images are not what causes it to lock for a few seconds every action. Hyperlinking appears to have no effect on how fast Git runs games, either. The only reasonable motives for the slow down are using some part of Inform in the wrong way. My own guess is that the synonyms are not being set up correctly, because the way Inform works is that if you don't set those the right way, every time you do anything, Inform will check every. single. object. for synonyms, even the ones that are not visible, and while that's not a problem with 50 objects, once you get to multiple thousand objects with many synonyms each, things get messy.\n\nSo I'd say set up a goal for yourself. What is the kind of machine you want to run this game? A notebook with 2gb ram? It's best if you own the target hardware, but you can get by through VMs, too. Also, while 500mb memory usage is indeed low, it's important to notice if this scales. Whenever I make something that I think might cause issues later on, I just spawn hundreds of them at once and check memory/process time to see how well it scales. Problems might not be noticeable with small numbers (Trap Quest was pretty fast in the early days), but they become apparent if you stress test them.",

Although, these images are somewhat limited to how much time you are willing to spend on drawing them.\n\nThis does not apply for a 3D-model where you can have each combination possible and for any, small or big, increment of a shape (morph).\n\nMy strong point so far: figured out an easy and fast workflow for exporting daz assets to UE4 without compromises (morphs, clothes, hair, materials, animations). Because of this there is a vast amount of customization possible and they work with any animation.\n\nThis is more or less a (almost finished) tech demo for myself and didn't bother thinking much beyond that. That means I want to scrap what I have and start over, but with the same back-end and assets.\n\nSo what I'm missing here is a setting and key gameplay elements that can really show off a characters change over time. Maybe a human factory? A slave trader?\n\nI have one limitation, I want most gameplay through UI, so you don't really control a character directly.

You're putting so much work into creating this 3D environment with morphing bodies and yet by the nature of the game, you won't fucking care 97% of the time.\n\nA management game is a game in which you manage MONEY and RESOURCES to get more MONEY and RESOURCES. Notice the lack of \"sex and women\" there? Because they're not of any importance in such a game. So now you've put in all this work and the only ones who are going to notice are the people who will most likely just hack the game to get unlimited money and resources to just get what they want so they can see the few scenes that are in the game, have a quick wank, then drop the rest of the game. The rest who does play the game will simply skip over all of the sexual stuff because \"Who the fuck cares, I got money to make, fucking get me back to the money making.\".\n\nTo them all that matters are numbers. Just take a look at the examples you've given.\n\nFree Cities. They're more interested in creating a fucking personal military and an orbital space station that can obliterate opposing Archologies. They also want to create as much weird shit as possible, but the actual lewd stuff is barely even a thing so you end up skipping it all the damn time.\n\nPortalsOfPhereon. \"How do I breed/get the best stats?\" Again, the numbers are the most important thing here. The girls/futas are there to make money or fight for you. Then there are a few lewds with the NPC's, but that's probably less than a tenth of the game.\n\nSlaveMatrix. These guys pretty much don't give a shit about the lewds anymore. They're jerking off to eugenics more than lewds at this point.\n\nWant my suggestion? You've got what LifePlay, by Vinfamy, lacks. Proper 3D models. So you can probably just rip off LifePlay and try and make a Sims-type game.\n\nIf I'm wrong in any of my assumptions, then please, do explain to me what I'm wrong about and why you/anyone else finds management games with lewds to be the best thing.",

What I mean by \"advanced\" is something that takes care of the tedious shit saving/loading, UI styling/scaling, render loop, good template syntax, etc for me in a way that's actually flexible. For example, Twine breaks if you do any kind of multiple references to the same object. I'm very familiar with Twine, but I hate it. The other HTML/JS based tools are just as bad.\n\nMost other frameworks I've seen are either entire simulated environments (which means SLOW/BLOATED) or have similar problems where I'll have to write custom serialization/parsing routines to load state correctly without something breaking which means extra work. I could write my own of course, but that's even more work since I'll also have to work out problems like UI scaling, styling, and other tedious bullshit.\n\nI don't care about \"simple\" or \"easy to learn\" because I'm not a fucking moron, but I haven't found anything that seems like it actually meets my needs. I'm hoping someone on here knows about something I haven't found through googling because otherwise I'll have to write my own framework from scratch and I'm not especially looking forward to that.\n\nI've also considered forking SugarCube and simply fixing the problems in it, but I'm not sure it's worth it since there are some really deep problems with how they designed the engine that I'm not sure I feel like fixing.\n\nSo, any suggestions, or am I stuck doing a fuckload of extra work just to make a decent game?",

Could search for the Live Maker the japanese tend to use, it seems to have built-in save system that works very well, iirc it does survive through updates, though it's still just a better-looking Ren'py.\n\nIt's hard to suggest without knowing what you intend to do. For instance, Ren'py will work fine with VNs with a lot of character-to-character dialogue, but it sucks as soon as you start adding longer texts. Meanwhile, Twine is amazing for long walls of text, but as soon as the player actually has to interact with something it's awful, which I'm guessing is at least one tick of your list of \"really deep problems\".\n\nI don't think most text game tools are very evolved, so you'll probably end up having to make your own. Coders are often not writers and writers are often not coders, and neither of those tends to have artistic skills to design good interfaces. Most tools are meant for a specific kind of developer. Twine targets the pure-writer that just wants to write a story, maybe branching a bit here and there - not really for games, at most CYOAs. Ren'py and their ilk are made for VNs like the japanese always did, but those rely more on art than on the writing, which is also why the text is restricted to a tiny part of the screen. Inform is a good middle term, but it's also like 1980s tech - literally.",

All I really want is something to render text for me from templates (which is basically how I have used Twine in the past - all the heavy lifting is in pure JS, and I just use SugarCube to render the scene once I've done the data/state manipulation in the background), handle basic UI scaling/etc, and serialize/deserialize game state to persistent storage.\n\nTwine can do templating okayish, and it's UI isn't utterly unusable, but it performs like shit and their idea of \"Serializing\" game state is basically JSON.stringify() which is a joke.\n\nThankfully, I do have the skillset to write my own. I can program well, I'm a fairly good writer, and I know how to do UI/UX though I absolutely hate doing it. I'll probably end up writing the parts I care about carefully, and then when it comes to the UI just having some unstyled table layout that gets the job done.

Of note, I have jury-rigged Dialogger to make dialog trees and already have a… decent… save system. The main issue with the save system is that my game is procedurally generated, so there's a lot that's intentionally not saved, but any variable you create with the variable classes is saved automatically. By default it auto-saves to local storage, but you can save to and load from files, as well. The save structure was designed to withstand game code updates.\n\nI assumed that Inform devs would have gotten text-game developing perfectly after so much time working with it, so I did go through some efforts to replicate parts of what they've done. It has a non-blocking Rulebook system for the code, like Inform did, and it also has actions, all that exists in the world inherits Thing in some way, whatever you print is a Say object, etc. Currently it will save any of the persistent variable types you create and also all of the Unique Things. Each new type of Thing needs to be told what of its own variables should be saved, however – by default, a Thing stores only its position, but a Person also stores its states, a money bag stores its contents, etc. It's HTML5/JS using HAML/TypeScript/Compass for the project, and it's copyleft open-source.\n\nNow the things that might be useful to you in particular:\n\n> Jury-rigged Dialogger that exports to javascript Dialogue Trees\n\n> Dialog Tree Processor\n\n> While the UI was meant to look like I7 for style, it should be trivial to make it look like anything else, or even reduce it to just the printer\n\n> UI maintains size regardless of resolution, so you see what your players should be seeing\n\nThe source is at:\n\nhttps://git.catrenelle.com/reddo/the-obelisk\n\nI have updated \"dist/The Obelisk.html\" to be runnable right now, though it's mostly placeholders for now, mostly testing the systems I have made to see if they work right.\n\nThe Main Menu itself is just a Dialogue Tree running, btw.

			"body": "It really depends on how deeply you want to learn. You want to learn how to make things do the things they should the do? Just find something you want automated and brute force your way into making it exist, over time you start to understand how to code.\n\nIf you really want to be a good programmer, however, there's a bit more that you'd need to learn. H-devs greatest failure is not correctly defining scope, which is the first thing you should do when beginning a project. Second biggest failure h-devs make is not make code maintainable; the trick to making maintainable code is to always pretend like the person who's going to maintain it is a serial killer with anger issues who knows where you live, and the fear should make you adhere to standards that are Good Code™.\n\nAt its core, coding is about knowing logic and knowing a few magic words that vary language to language (nothing major, most of the time). But you really ought to have actual classes to avoid developing bad habits while you learn the easy bits. For instance, I still have some issues with making self-explanatory code due to creating the habit of being lazy and naming variables stuff like \"a\". That's a stupid mistake to make, but if I'm looking at a complex block I might lose 10 minutes or more just trying to to follow where all the \"a\" and \"b\" are going.\n\nThe best languages to learn with are those with strict typing, which means they are like strict teachers and will slap you for being dumb (their strictness coerces you into writing better code). Not sure what I'd recommend, though. C is ancient, Java has too much stuff attached to it that might make it hard to understand for beginners. Most popular languages are not strict because that makes them easier to get into, but that also makes them bad for someone just starting, as they drive you to create these bad habits. You can get an idea about coding logic by just using RPG Maker and the like, too: the blocks inside events in RPG Maker mimic coding, except it's drag'n'drop rather than writing.",

			"body": ">I personally enjoy SciFi and Cyberpunk\n\nHow thoroughly do you want to integrate sexuality into your world? How thoroughly do you want to integrate sexuality into your gameplay? How thoroughly are you willing to integrate your world into your depictions of sexuality?\n\nLet's consider two examples: Iain Banks \"Culture\" series and Fenoxo's \"Trials in Tainted Space\" game. Both are sci-fi works in which wealth and technology allows humanoids to mutate their bodies according to their whims, experience altered states of mind, and (if they wish to do so) live lives of hedonistic sexual gratification.\n\nThe Culture novels push this stuff into the background, because the audience doesn't want to read about a sequence of sexual escapades. It's difficult for a sex scene to make full use of the setting. You *can* incorporate the setting into many other scenes (e.g. relativistic time dilation during a spaceship chase; wondrous materials being used to design impossible artifacts; telepathy being used in diplomatic negotiations; pew-pew lasers and jetpacks in a shootout). If you introduce high tech into sexuality then you quickly run into objections: \"why am I even trying to fuck a sweaty, awkward, temperamental human instead of visiting the holodeck (or fucking my heavily-customized sexbot) (or trickling a few microvolts through my brain) (or snorting 5mg of Orgasmarin powder)?\"\n\nFenoxo partially avoids this question by pushing the player character towards the uncivilized frontier (where fewer high-tech devices are available) and by incorporating sexual encounters into character development. The player character *could* just fuck their sexbot whenever they get horny … but they can't buy a sexbot until they've completed half of the game, and they need to fuck NPC_A in order to advance QUEST_B, so they'll probably fuck a lot of NPCs.\n\nYour post suggests that you're planning to write a more serious game. Perhaps we could imagine a scenario in which the player character (accompanied by a love interest) performs a dangerous mission, learns surprising secrets, defeats fearsome foes, and then returns to base. At that point the characters celebrate their success (cue saxophone music). This scene makes sense in a fantasy setting (with slight complications re: disease and contraception). But if your setting includes many things (e.g. stimulants, psychedelics, entertainment) which are *better* than sex, then you'll constantly be forced to explain *why* your characters have ignored those superior options in order to perform a caveman ritual. Or you'll need to strain your creativity as you write scenes of drug-enhanced augmented-reality robot-assisted FutureSex (which may be confusing or un-arousing for your readers). Or you'll need to downplay the sex itself and focus on the emotional context (e.g. trust, dominance, insecurity, etc). Or you'll just need to ignore the setting for a few minutes so that your characters can fuck in a way that's relatable and appealing to 21st century readers.\n\n>I need some inspiration.\n\nPlease give us some rough guidelines.\n\nDo your people live in villages, or in cities, or on satellites, or in post-apocalyptic underground bunkers? Are we working with conventional genders, or have they been blurred by contact with extraterrestrials? Is natural reproduction still a thing or are babies born from gestation pods? Do people fuck outside their species for fun (and/or is crossbreeding possible)? Is face-to-face communication relevant, or is information exchange entirely technological? Does the protagonist fight primarily with his hands, or his tools, or his mind? What sort of things in this world are scarce enough (or desirable enough) to fight over? If your protagonist accomplishes his quest and gets everything that he wants, then how might he wish to spend the remainder of his life? Is lifespan/ageing even a meaningful concept in your world?",

			"body": "Look at the most \"successful\" games in this area. This is not an area where marketing is being used - you just make your game and put it out there. I think the literal best sellers are around 10k sales (so ~100k revenue minus DLsite costs). The best patreons are around 2~6k a month - that's barely enough to cover ONE employee if you were a company.\n\nIf the porn game is successful seems to be dependent on the fetishes they include: if you include obscure fetishes your maximum sales amount is limited, but you're guaranteed to get sales even with a terrible game (because people with obscure fetishes often don't have other options to put their money on, so you have no competition). Furries are an odd case, they have a ton of games, but they also appear to have a ton of money, so targetting furries ALWAYS works. And if we're talking about patreon in specific, pandering for specific fetishes seems to be the best way of making money.\n\nThen for DLsite and others… the better the game part is and the less common the genre you're doing is, the more money you end up getting. Platformers usually sell well, regardless of how good they are, simply because they're rare (and they'll remain rare forever, shit's hard to make). VNs and RPGs usually sell themselves through the quality and quantity of their art alone, though you can get a bit extra success with RPGs by creating your own systems which are good.\n\nIndie porn game dev is multiple steps below normal indie game dev. It's mostly one guy in a basement doing it as a hobby, as opposed to a small group of people doing it as a job. The closest we have to marketing is that hw guy going to every forum, every thread and shitposting, but he's jew to the max and even tries to \"sign up\" other creators with himself, no idea what that even ends up meaning.",

The point-and-click \"groping\" gameplay is antiquated, but it's integrated with the bizarre monstergirl anatomy, the game's psychology variables, and the progression/economy system. The cross-breeding feature is very detailed and provides extensive re-playability. The game has sold 213 copies at $15. $3225 revenue.\n\nStrive4Power offers a polished experience, but it contains few original ideas. The entire sex minigame was lifted from Era (as a replacement for an earlier sex minigame which was worse); the combat is bog-standard JRPG; slave psychology is a heavily streamlined version of JoNT (more playable, but less interesting). The game has 880 patrons and requires a minimum $5 pledge for early access to software. I'm too lazy to lookup DLsite or Patreon fees, so let's just use raw numbers. $4400 monthly revenue.\n\nMaverik made a derivative game, promoted it on various porn-related forums, and maintains a social presence (via itch.io, discord, etc). Auto Eden made something special, posted it onto a crowded marketplace, and relied on word-of-mouth while he focused on extending and improving his game. Maverik earns more per month than Auto Eden has earned in total.\n\nPlease stop telling people that good games don't need advertising.",

			"body": "It seems you want to make a text-game like the older interactive fiction games. Inform 7 would mostly fit perfectly with what you want, given that it is pretty much updated Infocom, with the exception of:\n\n> nice UI\n\nThat's pretty much unfeasible with Inform without some heavy use of ==MAGIC== . To achieve that you'd have to use the ancient scrolls to interact with the Virtual Machine on a lower level, otherwise you get bad results and even worse performance. Most of the low-level stuff interacting more directly with the VM is undocumented, so you're SOL if you're trying to get it to work and you're not involved with the development of the interpreters. The people working with the interpreters are nice and would love to help you, though.\n\nTbh, it seems like you want to add a ton of systems, that means you will have to do a ton of coding regardless of what you end up choosing, so you might as well just pick whatever has the most of the stuff you want ready to go. My suggestion: bring down requirements and make a simpler game to start with. Also choose what you want to focus on: story or game? If game, Inform > Twine, otherwise Twine > Inform. Also keep in mind that Inform is essentially the ancient language of the gods, twine is the new kid on the block… that means you might find more diverse help for Twine than Inform. Twine also runs without interpreters, which is a big plus.\n\nWhile you can make anything in GameMaker, this would be akin to reinventing the wheel. You'd have to teach it to print text, if you want it to parse commands you'd have to teach it that AND you'd have to teach it to receive those commands as well, you'd have to teach it buttons, etc… it would be an incredibly large amount of work.\n\nSo, if you really want to go with infocom-style I'd strongly recommend Inform, because it's literally the maintained infocom style. It should also have a ton of plugins you can add that do stuff for you. Otherwise go with Twine, but it's going to be hell to make the UI look decent while also making the game go at a nice pacing, twine is just not meant for real games.\n\nIf you're going to make it all from the ground up I'd suggest just going with clean HTML5/Javascript. That gives you access to everything HTML and so you don't have to worry that much about presentation. It also works on every platform without any extra work. This would require you actually know how to code, however.",

			"body": ">How much of our game do you think we should have done before releasing a demo?\n\nWhat's the genre?\n\nSome games are more suitable than others for demos. A visual novel demo is arguably a waste of time - you're asking players to learn backstory and characters and become emotionally invested in them, but then you abruptly terminate the experience without a satisfying resolution. When you release the actual game, players will need to spend time replaying the original chapter(s) in order to access the new material, which is frustrating. If players are expected to repeat this process monthly, then you might alienate your early adopters. JRPGs often suffer similar problems, with dull content (character intros, backstory, fetch quests, exposition) being front-loaded in the early minutes. Action games can drop players into a mid-game mission for immediate excitement - but only if the game's controls and mechanics are simple enough to obviate a tutorial.\n\nYour demo needs to engage players in some way. Maybe you've got great artwork which can be sprinkled throughout a few minutes of boring gameplay. Perhaps you've created interesting mechanics (movement system, ability combos, puzzle designs, etc) which can impress players even if they completely ignore your world and characters. You might have written an original and amazing story - but that doesn't mean shit unless you can deliver it in an interesting way (it you're asking me to read a multi-page text dump before I've seen any gameplay, then you fail as a game designer).\n\n> i'm not sure if anyone would bother playing it this early on.\n\nWhat do *you* actually want from the demo?\n\n* interest check. You want to know how many players would potentially play and/or buy your game (in its *current* unfinished state). This feedback will help you to gauge how much more work is needed before the game is truly enjoyable for players.\n\n* consumer-level feedback. You're committed to the core design of your game and its story, but you're willing to make minor adjustments (e.g. difficulty tuning, item drop rates, breast sizes) based on feedback.\n\n* designer-level feedback. You're willing to make fundamental changes to your game (e.g. remove the combat system, add puzzle dungeons, rewrite the plot into a revenge story, swap the MC's gender) based on feedback.\n\n* recruitment. The demo is intended to show off your talents, but the game cannot reach its final intended state without assistance. The demo will entice talented people to contact you and join your team.\n\n* hype. You've already finalized the game design and your team is full. You just need time to complete the game. You're hoping to build/sustain enthusiasm by releasing incremental demos. Interested players will be invited to join your Discord, subscribe to your Twitter, and spread word-of-mouth.\n\n* funding. You plan to release a few early demos, but you'll eventually limit access to crowdfunding donors only (in order to offset dev costs, commission custom artwork and music, pay library license fees, etc).\n\n* content. Your game includes significant potential for user-generated content (e.g. level design, character customization, AI scripting, modding). You need users to tinker with these systems in order to test their limits, refine them, and verify that the custom content can be shared and remixed in the intended ways (e.g. MacOS-derived content can be imported onto an Android device).\n\nNote: if you answer \"all of these above\" then you're dodging the question. The answer here should guide your demo-release strategy. If you want hype, then hold back until you have a polished demo available (and a scheduled release date). If you want designer-level feedback, then you should release a barely-working early demo with stolen/placeholder assets.",

			"body": "I have a vague idea of a text-based game in which a heroine has to sneak around town naked, or bottomless or etc for some reason.\n\nI have a sense that I want this to be a bit like the era games. That is, characters are a bundle of unchangeable and changeable traits, stats, skills etc that combine into a unique (or unique-feeling) entity who reacts differently to different situations. While some have special dialogue or unique traits, virtually all of them are subject to the player’s whims.\n\n(I guess another way to describe this system would be “like CKII”.)\n\nThe issue is that I don’t really know how I’d go about brainstorming the actual meat and potatoes of the game design, and I don’t have a clear idea of how gameplay would function (or rather, I don’t know where I ought to start). I don’t even know if you’d play as the unfortunate lady, or as some kind of malevolent entity haunting her, or as some kind of malevolent entity haunting a specific part of town in which you’d toy with the lives of pedestrians walking through.\n\nI need to have a clearer idea of where this concept will go before I end up stuffing all my conflicting fetishes into it and turning it into a bloated mess. Unfortunately I don’t know many resources out there for porn game design, which of course is why I ask here.\n\n(Though, while typing this all out I’ve brainstormed quite a bit, like the idea of haunting a specific part of town instead of someone specific. So maybe I just need to blog about it some more.)",

You need to draw everything three times so the only point of that would be if each character had her own storyline (doesn't have to be too different) since the scenes have to be unique anyway since that is what takes up the most time. However if you want to constantly release updates people wont play with all 3 every patch, so it doesn't work well with that model. It could work if you have one main character picked but you can still access the scenes from the others as they become followers or you take control of them for a period of the game.",

They would be successful even without the gameplay as sprite porn galleries.\n\nThen again, a game of any kind that looks wonderful but plays like shit and runs like shit is bad all around. Gotta program it decently to make an h-game work. Coding is significantly faster (not neccesairly easier) to learn than drawing from scratch, hence the \"artist first\".",

I don't pay for bread while it's still dough, I don't pay for a table while it's still raw wood.\n\nStart small, then invest the money made into larger and larger projects with time. ONLY once you've got your own traction should you start something like a Jewtreon; at which point offer no rewards whatsoever and just keep it exclusively as a personal tip jar.\n\nI for one can attest that I prefer devs that start off on short-but-complete 30 minute RenPy's than the ones that start on the next Big Brother/DmD/MotH with a brand new engine, new models and some shitty gimmick that never gets used; only for it to all fall through before you even get a virtual BJ. Hell, some of the best ones I've ever played are just short, polished 30 min RenPys with a split ending over fully branching paths.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with just treating this industry like every other one, and selling finished product.\n",

Something similar to some free to play games (thinking PoE and such).\n\nRelease a complete base game with a finished gameplay loop that can stand on its own. Then a few times a year release an expansion that adds new content. Could be a character pack with new characters, a cosmetic pack with new wearables, a fetish pack that adds X fetish content, or whatever. That way people can clearly see what they're getting and donate/pay accordingly.\n\nThe end result would be the sort of expansive game that many patreon games claim to be making, only delivered in a fair way where people only pay when you actually do something.",

			"body": "Ok, you've got something going so far. My biggest compliment to the game is that I'm glad how clean it is. Most new games either feel completely barren or cluttered with actions that aren't part of the game yet, and I feel like you've hit a good middle, which makes me want to wait for the next version and see what'll be added next. The tutorials were also pretty well formatted and I could skim through them pretty quickly and get the gist on how the game worked. For some special idoits out there I'd reccommend implementing a tutorial list containg all past tutorials so someone can easily reread them and see if they missed anything..\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, I felt that some things could use a little tweaking. The warrior and the assassin were the only characters that could actually hold their own. While all the classes had interesting gimmicks that, with the right setup and management, could lead to good damage, I often found myself dying before pulling it off. On that note, the healer is extremely weak and while the temporary health they grant is \"cool\", I'd much prefer more potent, straight-to-the-point healing abilities. Either that or implement some kind of basic potion system.\n\nWith that said, I think the Witch was the only other class that I thought was pretty interesting in terms of abilities. Most of the other classes defensive and debuff abilities were pretty useless and I never found myself beniffiting from the race bonuses. The enemy would still decimate me whether I pulled it off or not. I won't complain about the difficulty too much though as I found myself winning more reliably as I got used to the classes and the enemies themselves. I will say that while I appreciate there not being any repercussions for losing could there PLEASE be an \"escape\" feature\". Three actions in I can tell pretty reliably when I'm going to lose or win and it's a drawl to wait for myself to die. Also, the lich and undead skeleton encounter that you have in the game is extremely overpowered if only because it has the ability to straight up heal itself which literally no other enemy can do and I never am able to deal enough damage to kill them.\n\nNow for the sex-scenes. I'd say it's pretty basic and that's appropiate considering how unfinished the game is. There's just nothing that jumped out at me and made think \"Woah, this is good\". It all just felt rather dry with all action but no description of said action. I'd recommend taking a peek at the CoC thread and the game itself. Fetishes aside, MOST of the writing manages to splice description with action pretty well. With all things though, the more you do it the better you'll get so don't dwell on the sex scenes too much. Seriously, don't though. Creators going out of their way to make ball-busting sex scenes when their not too familiar with it kills most of these little projects.\n\nSo, with my autistic rant done, the only things I have left to say are: add more \"cleave\" like abilities and make the abilities a bit more potent in general.",

			"body": ">If this isn't built on a very innovative concept, then i have no much interest in this.\n\nDevil's Advocate: a mundane concept *could* still be worthwhile, depending on the details of its implementation.\n\nIf the dev team has setup highly modular content, robust APIs, and separable code … then it's *acceptable* for the game to just be a collection of familiar gameplay mechanics in a generic fantasy setting. Modders could then give it a decent world map, additional races, difficulty rebalance, extended quests, new sex actions, Portugese UI translation, etc. I had hoped to see Strive for Power deliver on such promises, but the modding system turned out to be cumbersome and unreliable.\n\nStrive for Power used (mostly) plaintext source code. Modding was a pain-in-the-ass, but a sufficiently motivated loser *could* make improvements and expansions using MSPaint or Notepad. Unity demands a higher level of technical proficiency from modders, which will discourage many people from even trying. Unless the developer makes a conscious and sustained effort to support mods (e.g. Rimworld), it's unlikely that Alunia will see any secondary content aside from cheats. Therefore the game's entire value proposition will rest on the developer's ability to deliver interesting content. And so >>313270's criticism definitely applies, because this demo simply doesn't show any unique spark of creativity or talent. It echoes features, UI elements, and aesthetics from other games - but if fails to express a clear vision of what *this* game will eventually become.\n\nHere are a few potential changes to consider:\n\n* shift design focus towards the *map* - the player character's location, their ability to travel, the significance of terrain, and the different actions which can be performed in various places. Maybe the game could grow into something akin to Mount&Blade, with the player attacking remote villages for fresh slaves and then returning to civilization for resupply (or making risky forays into enemy territories in search of rich plunder) (or wandering dangerous forests to slay legendary monsters).\n\n* shift design focus towards the *party* - the player character's companions, their strengths and weaknesses, their loyalty, and their ability to work as a team. Maybe the game could grow into something akin to No Haven, with the player selectively abducting, recruiting, and/or training characters to fill key roles. In order for this system to be fully satisfying, the game must also present a wide variety of challenges to the party (combat, traps, exploration, negotiation, infiltration, survival, seduction, etc).\n\n* shift design focus towards the *struggle* - the contest of wills between the player character and their slave(s). Implement overly-complicated variables for psychology, mood, trust, confidence, arousal, etc. Give the player incomplete information and present them with dozens of possible actions at every moment. Increase the difficulty so that careless play often leads to rebellious or mindbroken slaves. Jack o Nine Tails used this approach - but it was arguably due to shitty code and lazy testing (rather than intentional obfuscation).\n\n* shift design focus towards *power* - the player character's status in the world, their subjugation of slaves, and their relationship with authorities and quest-givers. Establish characters within the game world who are exerting power responsibly (or capriciously) and encourage the player to interact with them. Allow the player to treat subordinates kindly or harshly, and show consequences for these decisions. Present different forms of power within the game lore (e.g. hereditary aristocrats vs talented mages vs wealthy merchants vs revered priests) and force them to collide. Plan some lategame events in which the player can support/usurp/enslave some of the major NPCs.\n\n* write a setting/story which gives an interesting *context* for the mundane gameplay. Maybe some races are rare within the game world, so that the player will be excited upon finding one of them. Maybe the player character has a relevant backstory (former slave? disgraced noble?) which allows for sympathy and roleplaying. Maybe there's political upheaval or intrigue which invites the player to choose a side.",

You could simply collapse affinity and agility under the same stuff and have strength/magic be collapsed under the other as \"class mastery\" or something along this to calculate damage and everything, i would like some setting to add the damage calculation as well.\n\nTo the interface part of problems, it kinda sucks but is not the worse i have meet, but we never know what we earned in battle, the experience system makes no sense and we never know how far some character is along his levelling, the items that we get we don't know what they do unless we put them on and keep note on the changes, we don't know what costs actions nor doesn't as well, and upgrade tab on the main map area is worth less considering we don't do this solo nor can we change it to other unit by pressing the keys.\n\nSeveral graphical bugs i have meet as well like hire tab showing a race/class that is nothing about the character that is hired and we can't sell hired ones as well, quests disappear from world map once we load the game, the hex tile is not clearly defined and we don't know what we are clicking to go to, slave tab losing its shit and making sure i can't see current status of the slave.\n\nAnd about combat I have some question is on the healer class, why can't it heal and any overhealing be used as the shield? The lichs can combat/heal/shield their own units and have about 65 damage reduction for a unit that hits hard and can spawn up to 3, our healer is kinda stupid in comparison, giving one shield that can barely stop one single attack from anything and doesn't take precedence on the status bleed/burn, one status cleanse from one unit considering they are plenty and can sometimes be casted in aoe agaisnt us, aegis with its pitiful duration and reliance on AI coding, pacify which might be the best ability, song of valor being the only sure morale increasing ability for the party is only usefull once in a while besides being one upgrade usefull.\n\nAnd demon cerberus, mummy and giants right now crash the game. Will try if i can do dungeons besides two fights before going more about combat in general.",

			"body": "Very good points, thank you. I was aware most of the issues you listed and will fix them in the next update, kinda rushed this version.\n\n>Why separate through strength/agility and intelligence/affinity\n\nMainly for future additions such as arcane archer class, humans can already specialize somewhat on their dump stats with upgrades and legendary talismans. They are also used for non combat interactions: agility and affinity affects beauty, exploration is based on sum of all stats and dialogues will have stat checks in the future.\n\n>we don't know what costs actions nor doesn't\n\n>The lichs can combat/heal/shield their own units and have about 65 damage reduction for a unit that hits hard and can spawn up to 3\n\nYes I need to show more information, I wanted to make a character sheet for enemies that shows up on mouse over which shows their skills and gives tips about their weaknesses, this may take some time.\n\nUndead units have 50% higher reduction at the cost of 30% lower health, this can be exploited by abilities that ignore or nullify reduction such as bodkin shot or curse of mortality. They are also immune to morale and bleeding damage. I have nerfed the lich heal but it will also deal aoe morale damage. The temporary health is actually the shielded slash skill of the skeletons and the value is based on the number of skeletons.\n\n>why can't it heal and any overhealing be used as the shield\n\nI plan on focusing more on fights similar to the dungeon where you don't heal between battles, for now it is just annoying but it could be interesting once the system is fleshed out.\n\nSo about the healer, I have nerfed aegis several times during testing and thought about removing it because it can negate excessive amounts of damage especially if you build speed and use cure to time it. Units like behemoth should be the same value as 2 adventurer, if the healer gets lucky and manages to aegis when 2 behemoth is using a big attack then she basically 4 times more valuable than usually. I always felt like healer and knight is a must in every team. Cure can be very good against enemies such as the imp who explodes the burn stacks on you, it only has 1 action cost. However I did most of the testing at level 1 and 5 and forgot to test some of the enemies I added later.",

(dwarfs are pretty much very good tanks as well, but because of them being slow they are worse than humans in the shield bash enemies side of things and will always be behind the enemy attack speed)\n\nAssassin lacks attack I mean a lot of attack it is a wasted slot, does pitiful damage even with macabre buff + hope on the pitiful 30 just bumps it to 40, the bleed is worthless on several enemies and the use that i had for assassin was just to make enemies slower one by one instead of killing them and because i it choose as starting i couldn't even get rid of myself.\n\nRanger is alright and is better than assassin all around because he is not limited by front line attacks only, save for his 5 ability which is worthless.\n\nMage is a very good supportive role, has decent damage, and can apply some status and hold enemies as well.\n\nNow for some weirdness on upgrades, humans females have one upgrade with the tooltip inverted on the second roll, it states using strength/agility for mage/healer class, intelligence/affinity for knight class.\n\nElfs got the short end of the stick, being incapable of being mages because their race upgrades focuses on affinity somehow, making them worse all around, the hatred of orcs upgrade just destroys their morale as well for not good damage output. They can be fast assassins with no damage behind, they can potentially be ok rangers only because of the rangers upgrades. They are literally geared towards only witches.\n\nDwarfs are the perfect tank, unable to move, unable to die.\n\nHumans are the best species overall just because they are more general on their upgrades with no drawbacks and capability to go first (which is useless on ranger), with two cases they being worse is witch and tank only knight.\n\nAnd it appears the longer you go with the daily updates messages that have your input the more easily your game just breaks and you can't do anything because the save corrupted retrogressively, by corrupting any save related to the current playthrough. Somehow your game is trying really hard to not work. Any first break will fuck up hiring, any second or more and you are already looking at everything starting to go downhill and you can't level up new hires.\n\nFunnily enough the first save corruption i had was when i got the daily message that one of my slaves was getting corrupted, i ignored it and i couldn't play that save anymore.",

As a man who only gets erect at the sight of numbers and stats, imagine the fucking hype when I saw this thread.\n\nAs for actual feedback:\n\n-Do the stats unrelated to a class affect the character in any way?E.G. strength and agility for healer/mage/witch or intelligence and affinity for knight/ranger/assassin.\n\n-Claims that the genre is saturated don't hold much water considering that Strive for Power, No Haven, or Free Cities are essentially more-developed versions of Whoremaster, which is a 10 year old game, yet they're of the most popular h-games in development. When the game is good, regardless of tropes and genre, people will be interested.\n\n-If the protagonist is on the move constantly but is still able to interact with their slaves, does that mean the slaves are traveling with them?\n\n-As others have said, pregnancy is awesome. At the same time however, depending on what direction you move the game towards (more management heavy, RPG heavy, narrative heavy, etc), having dozens of children stuck in baby limbo while the protagonist is roaming the country could become problematic. Orphanages? Adoption? Keeping an in-home nurse in the MC's mansion to look after them? Time magic to speed their aging along and cut out the baby problem all together? I dunno.\n\n-The healer's overhealing is nice, in place of it flat out restoring health. It gives an incentive to make use of the rest feature or renting out an inn or whatever, rather than just healing everyone to full after each fight and moving on.\n\n-You mentioned lore and how it might overwhelm. If inspiration strikes and you feel like 10 paragraphs are needed to describe the socioeconomic impact dwarves have on the steel trade, go nuts. Too much lore has never hurt anyone.\n\n-I like the idea of hex exploration and the turn system. It gives room for random events based on the hex you're on or time-sensitive quests and relationship tracking (a slave kept happy+obedient, unhappy+defiant, etc for so many turns triggers an event that gives the slave a perk based on that mood–that kind of thing).\n\nLooking forward to where this goes.",

			"body": ">stick with the usual hgame mechanics first\n\nThis is a good idea only if your finished game will *include* these exact elements. If you've implemented them as mere placeholders then that's a waste of effort, because your v0.001 demo was *never* going to offer a satisfying play experience. Your demo ought to say \"here are my cool new ideas\" instead of saying \"here are someone else's ideas, which you've already seen before, and which I've copy-pasted in order to make this demo feel like a complete game.\"\n\nExample: your combat UI resembles Strive for Power. Strive's UI is very good at depicting horde battles, in which a large number of fodder enemies mindlessly attack the player's team. Without showing a single line of text, the combat UI can convey ideas such as: \"your team is outnumbered\" or \"the enemy has just received reinforcements\" or \"the outnumbered team gets fewer actions per turn.\" All of these messages nudge the player into acquiring combat-capable slaves, intead of attempting to play the game as a solo adventure (which is good, because the game is not balance for solo play). If *your* game will consist mainly of head-to-head battles between large parties, and if the enemy characters rarely/never use special abilities, then echoing the Strive UI is a good decision.\n\nBut the Strive UI can't show terrain, or formations, or high-ground advantage, or cover, or flanking/ambush/encirclement. Its animations can't distinguish between long-ranged and melee actions. It can't effectively depict positional advantage, unusual forms of movement, or AOE attacks. The interface is streamlined and efficient, but the result is that each individual action lacks emphasis (even - for example - a sudden crit which kills the player's waifu). The characters can't pause mid-battle for a VN-style conversation or death soliloquy. It's infeasible to deliver a climactic 1-on-1 duel in the Strive combat system, so the plot sets up 1-on-1 confrontations and then ignores them (the player's full party suddenly appears and then the Fairness Genie gives the boss a handful of bodyguards). The Strive UI cannot easily indicate roles such as \"backline healer\", \"main tank\", \"flanking ranger\", etc. It can't depict stealth, aggro, area denial, lines of retreat, etc. Therefore such concepts simply weren't added to the game, and the player never gained the ability to win an \"underdog\" battle via clever tactics or good reactions.\n\nIt's useful to contrast Strive against Portals of Phereon, which uses a randomly generated hex-grid map for its combat encounters. PoP puts heavy emphasis on the unique traits and abilities of its various monstergirl species, and these peculiarities are fully expressed during combat. The system rewards balanced teams (tank, crowd control, support, glass-cannon mage, etc) and often allows the player to seize (or bypass) important chokepoints on the map. The battle system encourages the player to maintain a large and diverse harem (mermaids are crucial for ocean battles but useless in forests … so you'll probably want 2-3 mermaids in reserve). But the battle system also has a low level cap, which encourages the player to regularly bring \"fresh blood\" into the party instead of relying on a few favorite companions. These aspects of the combat design *support* the core appeal of the game: find weird creatures, journey with them through weird places, make them stronger, then cross-breed them and repeat the whole process with their offspring. PoP combat isn't fun, fast, or pretty … but it exists in harmony with all of the game systems.\n\n>Your suggestions were mostly already planned\n\nIf a few were already planned then that's great. Which ones?\n\nIf they're *all* on the development roadmap then that's a mistake. You *cannot* deliver a game with great party-based combat AND complex psychological slave-training AND thorough examination of power dynamics AND extensive customization of the player character AND political intrigue AND exciting world-map exploration. There are people who want each of those things, but few people want/expect ALL of them within a single game. A combat-focused player will be annoyed if the slave-training minigame demands too much of his attention. A training-focused player will be dismayed if he can't faceroll the boss battles. A breeding-focused player will be frustrated if he's asked to resolve 50 random events while he mashes \"End Turn\" and waits for a fetus to gestate. You *cannot* please everyone, and you shouldn't try to do so. Please tighten your scope; focus on doing 1-2 things *well* instead of doing 6 things adequately.",

			"body": "Good mechanics doesn't mean \"challenging\" or \"deep\". You don't want me engaging my brain too much as a player or I'm gonna go into critical thinking mode and tear your shitty world model apart instead of enjoying it because what you have here as a fundamental game concept isn't interesting or unique and none of your gameplay elements are even close to a good strategy game or JRPG in complexity or fun.\n\nWhat you want is something that games reasonably well. I'm not even sure why you faggots are always so obsessed with combat since that's basically filler you have to slog through to get to the porn. There's a million fucking ways to make sex and slave management interesting inherently because psychology is complicated and there's all kinds of erotic conflict that you can use to make the game challenging and sexy and complex without tacking on irrelevant bullshit.\n\nIf you ripped out your fucking shitty combat system and put all the effort you were going to waste on orthogonal bullshit into making the game characters interesting and complex so that managing them was actually engaging instead of \"work out the game dev's shitty excuse for a black box and how to game it effectively\" then you'd have the basis for a good game. What you want is unexpected (but plausible and compelling) results to things the player does naturally.\n\nIf you were to have your nice complex set of variables that represent the slave's state - things like obedience, affection, sexual tension, arousal, fear, physical and psychological needs of various kinds (comfort, security, intimacy, approval, attention, etc) - and then came up with a nice set of slave modifiers (attributes) that changed how those values changed in response to various environmental factors and events, and actually wrapped all this up in a nice polished way, then you'd have something unique. Something where you'd have to think about each slave as an individual instead of another robot that you know exactly how to program.\n\nLet's take FC as a good example, or Strive4Power, or SlaveMaker3. All of them try to make their slaves \"unique\" with really superficial shit, but every one of them has a formula you can use to make any slave a loving/obedient slut very quickly. Or a terrified/hateful rapedoll if that's your thing. It's not interesting after you've figured it out because no matter what or who you're dealing with you can treat them all the same.\n\nThis game is going down the exact same fucking path. That's fine if you want another mediocre game, but don't expect anyone to care about it unless you do something that's actually unique and that means not doing the exact same bullshit everyone else did in a very slightly different way so that at 10,000 feet your game looks exactly the same as all the others.",

I am aware of the irony) but OP has an interesting combat system, it is different at least from the standard rpgmaker thing you get in hgames, so its worth developing i think.\n\nIN all honesty id rip the slave management system out and grow it organically. Start with simply having a slave market system, you can capture some enemies to sell. Then a way to store them and use them for more interesting activities, then finally tack on breeding mechanics and whatever else direction you want to go into. Grow it out of the combat.",

			"body": "Purification\n\nAfter I read a thread here and someone suggested purification as game theme, I thought that was a pretty good idea.\n\nI've spent three days and about 20 hours of coding and it seems worthwhile to throw a month of free time at this, maybe more, we'll see.\n\n——\n\nSetting Outline:\n\n2038 - you're 19 and you're burying your father. You grew up with stories of what the world was like before you were born, how the internet used to nave useful information or how you could order furniture and food…imagine that! Sometimes you wonder if he didn't mix in a lot of fantastical elements, just to keep your attention. He loved telling stories. No more stories, then.\n\nHe never let you go into the city, but during his sickness, when you had still hope he might make it, you had to go sometimes to trade. This was one place where he hadn't exaggerated what it was like.\n\nFirst you saw two girls together. They were performing for a crowd, right there in the street. Their bodies slithering over each other. Mouths agape, tongue hanging out. Yes, I think I know what you are thinking, but it wasn't like that. Perhaps if they didn't look like their ribs might put each other's eyes out, it could have been aroused in the slightest. Where the girls were emaciated, most of the crowd were quite plumb. People shouted at them what they should do next. A man tried to join them when he was pushed back by another, demanding pay for it. A fight ensued, knifes drawn. You left before you could see whether they got out alive or not.\n\nAnd this was only the beginning of the depravity you saw there. Drugs, sluts, cruelty, whores, e-thots, the depressed and downcast and that only scratches the surface of what you've seen in the last two weeks.\n\nNow that father is dead, it is time to build your own future. And perhaps you could rescue one rotten creature and find a pearl underneath? Your father said it couldn't be done, \"you can not save a whore\". He was right about most things. But not about this. You would prove him wrong. Maybe.\n\n—–\n\nWhat is the scope?\n\nI'm trying a couple of different gameplay ideas out until I find something that is mildly enjoyable. The first prototype will probably be a little bit of survival gameplay with a variety of temptations (if there's no danger, it's hard to create temptation for the player). Rather than a binary corruption system, I'm creating something along at least 4 different axis of corruption, so that it's possible to have multiple playthroughs where you don't have to be pure in every axis (though it's probably possible, we'll see).\n\nThere are a whole host of ways a girl can be corrupted and you have to learn and detrain them in her. She too will be tempted to relapse and you'll have to deal with the fallout. There are fail states where a girl might leave, die or just not want to have anything to do with you anymore, though there is an endless supply of wretches.\n\n—–\n\nHelp me answer these questions:\n\n1. Are there any specific types of corruption that you would really like to see?\n\n2. Are there any specific ways you'd like to be able to purify?\n\n3. Anything I haven't thought of but that I should be asking?\n\n—–\n\nArt\n\nRight now I'm building the game to be fun. I've contacted a few artists (Alexis was made for another game). I'll put some money into it, but it will probably not happen for the first or second build, I am going to have a barebones alpha ready by next weekend (16 feb)\n\nIf you are a decent or better artist and would like to work on this, let me know.\n\nThis could end up being paid work for years, as I plan to be making games for at least the next 3 years.\n\n—–\n\nWriting\n\nI'm a so-so writer (judge for yourself by the outline at the top), but I'll do it myself unless I find someone willing to help for free. I don't have sufficient money to pay for writing. Though I'll set up some type of donation jar or patreon and when we do well, the next project will be paid, so if you're passionate and you're easy to work with, hit me up and we'll be making games for years.\n\n—–\n\nAnything you'd like to ask about the current plans? Feel free to shoot.",

No more negative wood.\n\n>What the point of buying food in town when you have two options of getting it yourself (I suspect that hunting predators is the \"high risk high reward\" option)?\n\nCurrently you just need food to restore health, but as the game develops you will have constant need of food. Now you receive perfect information about where you're going, but that will probably be fuzzied in the future.\n\nBuying food allows a safe way to regain health if you've planned for the future.\n\nThe second build adds the tiniest element of danger for doing anything in a location with predators. They grow more dangerous with higher encounter rating and you can now die. (though being renpy you can roll it back, currently)\n\nObviously the survival thing needs work, I built the survival part in less than a day. I'm also considering moving away from ren'py, most of the code is in python anyways.\n\nWood will help you build various things and be the main source for income at the early stage.\n\nVersion 2 of the alpha:\n\nMac:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!dRJwTCzL!DBnuVQfNdKz-RzKPcSalsWbzT5C6zM8sLjZOPdkA4s0\n\nPC:\n\nhttps://mega.nz/#!YMZGGKZI!rbOEITORPW9ZCgzPmlo_ys_OASazYhf4yE8zPH_lVdI",

Although the old thread said that a new such thread would result in a deletion and ban, it is now full - I am thus making this thread anew.\n\nPrevious threads:\n\n1) http://archive.is/bdqSO\n\n2) http://archive.is/Cx0dH\n\nSimple Suggestions To Help Anons Locate Files When No One Else Will\n\nFor New Uploaders: I suggest using a temporary storage service that doesn't require a login like filedropper or nofile.io in order to avoid having your filehosting accounts banned for hosting porn/hosting illegal content (if your content happens to be illegally obtained).\n\n>Long-term storage runs the risk of hurting you or coming back to bite you in the ass later.\n\n>Attach passwords (if applicable) to prevent bots and newfags from simply searching and locating your files to send DMCA requests.\n\n>Name your folders something related to the game but not the game's name for the same reason as above\n\n>If you know what you're doing, carry on and disregard the above advice.\n\nFor Beggars:\n\nIf you live in North/South America or China, try searching for a torrent before begging. Most of North/South America has pretty lax laws or doesn't care about going after people for torrenting porn games (especially H-games). A VPN or at least a proxy is always recommended, but I've never used a VPN before in my 5 years of torrenting, and never had a letter or fine from my ISP of course I only torrent shit from Asia and obscure porn games, not Game of Thrones episodes and obvious shit like that. If you live in Europe (especially Germany and UK), Korea, or Japan, a VPN is pretty much required, and I'd suggest begging first, with torrents as a last resort (unless you know what you're doing).\n\nIf you legit don't know where to look for torrents or start, use nyaa.pantsu.cat/nyaa.si first (safest one, almost a guarantee all files are clean), and then either torrentz.colorask.com or torrents.me if your results weren't on nyaa. Always use a magnet link instead of downloading .torrent files as it reduces your risk of catching a virus! Any good torrenting site will contain both. If they don't have a magnet link you can copy/paste into your torrent client, it's probably a virus site, but assume any download contains a virus unless you've confirmed its contents with an antivirus program or it has something like 50+ seeders.\n\nSince you've resorted to begging anyways, a google search of popular porn sites fapforfun, f98, ulmf, hongfire may turn up the results you're looking for. For instance, most of the Rape of the Dead links were ripped from F98 users and rehosted on mega or nofile.io for anons. Incognito mode and deleting your browser data from the last 1-3 hours should be all you need to do to remove those pesky \"XXX game\" search results from your browser's memory. Stay safe out there!",

The game looks pretty cool for the poly count. The dev planned on expanding the game, and it could have been another Super Deepthroat with mod capabilities and the such. However, it seems like the dev got married and his wife forced him to stop the development.\n\nhttps://oxopotion.itch.io/poke-abby\n\n>What if Adventure Time was a 3D Anime?\n\nAdmittedly one of the best hentai games I've played, both in looks and gameplay. A shame the dev became a cuck, backpedalled off the game and now he is changing all the game to have different models altogether. He can suck a dick. However, the early versions of the games are still pretty good, but he progressively stripped it from porn in the following versions.

If you aren't ready to do this by now (without a good team), then better stop, to avoid getting frustrated and also frustrate other peeps here like me. You probably won't get to build an effective team out of strangers in the middle of a strenuous translation process.\n\nOn the other hand, don't shy down from asking help about difficult words or structures which seem to make no sense. There are tons of knowledgeable peeps around, here, on the ULMF boards, on the fuwanovel forums and elsewhere (Discord), always willing to help someone on improving their skills. Who knows, you might be able to gather a team for your next translation that way ?\n\nFinally, if you prove to be a good translator over time (with finished games), set up a patreon. I'll make sure to send a couple of bucks your way. PS : I hope you'll stick to your guns, the game looks worth it. Good luck.",
