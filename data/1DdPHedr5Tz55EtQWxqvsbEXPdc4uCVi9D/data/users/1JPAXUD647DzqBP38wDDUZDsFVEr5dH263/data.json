Did not fact check. Remember that Nascar driver who falsely cried \"racism\"? When it was later shown that his garage door \"hanging loops\" had been there since the garage door was installed...maybe 3 years earlier? FBI was on that one. 15ea agents assigned. Yell \"Nigger!\" and they would have doubled it.\n\nSo far, no agents assigned to Minneapolis ballot harvesting.\n\nSo why do we need the nurse Cratchet FBI? Seems like the worst government bullshit job there is. These are not essential workers.\n\nhttps://reclaimthenet.org/fbi-partners-with-social-media-platforms-to-target-misinformation/\n\nSubject: \tFBI partners with social media platforms to target “misinformation”\nDate: \tMon, 28 Sep 2020 16:00:35 +0000\nFrom: \tDidi Rankovic\n\n\nLast we heard of the FBI in the context of its (acute) interest in content shared on social media platforms has been the agency’s effort to impose more mass surveillance via private sector developed tools.\n\nBut now, the FBI is emerging as a partner to those same social media giants, as they fight their largely self-styled and self-imposed battle (in response to relentless pressure and scrutiny from certain political and media centers) against what is presented as the ultimate scourge of “misinformation.”\n\nAn entire complicated and complex narrative has been built around the need to suppress this phenomenon as pretty much the only way to ensure a legitimate presidential election in the US – and also, deal with the COVID saga efficiently.\n\nIt doesn’t help the case of furthering democracy or upholding free speech, however, that “fighting misinformation” has all too often proved to be a thinly-veiled disguise for imposing non transparent and inconsistent censorship on major, centralized social networks.\n\nBut any potential controversy and muddiness around the subject has apparently not held the FBI back from getting involved in defending “Covid and election” topics, as reports are saying.\n\nTo exactly nobody’s surprise, the FBI said they have established “a relationship” with social media, and other tech companies.\n\nBut it’s not what you think – i.e., more mass surveillance and indiscriminate data harvesting. This time, as FBI Salt Lake City Division’s Casey Harrington explained, it’s about sharing “threat information.” Harrington also threw around a “fan favorite” term – “trustworthy news” – as something users are to be steered towards.\n\nBut agent Harrington also shared some “real news”: for all its alleged potential to derail and destroy an entire democracy, “fake news” coming from US citizens is nothing actually illegal.\n\n“The FBI cannot initiate an investigation based solely on speech protected by the First Amendment,” he revealed.\n\nBut the likes of Twitter and Facebook can certainly stifle that speech, (mis)representing themselves as “plain and simple mom-and-pop shops” – rather than the de facto digital public spaces that they are and that should also be bound by the First Amendment.\n\nAs to why the FBI would even risk any future question marks over its role in the messy game of teaming up with giant private entities, as they play arbiters and gatekeepers of free speech – that is clearly a question for another day.",

			"body": "Subject: \tPushing election “misinformation” online is about to be a criminal offense in California\nDate: \tWed, 23 Sep 2020 03:11:47 +0000\nFrom: \tDidi Rankovic\n\nhttps://reclaimthenet.org/california-sb-739/\n\nCalifornia Democrats have gone out of their way to punish users on social media platforms expressing their doubts or criticism of the US voting system allowing and, as of late, expanding the right of voters to mail-in their ballots in the November presidential vote.\n\nIn another era, we might be tempted to call this type of thing and the stern language its expressed in as something coming from “the Thought Police”:\n\n“If you’re putting out tweets, Facebook posts or using social and other types of media to intentionally mislead voters about their right and ability to vote by mail, that’s now a crime, and it’s my hope local DA’s and the state attorney general will go after violators the moment they see them,” Democrat Henry Stern said of the legislation, SB 739, that was signed into state law by the California governor on Friday.\n\nRead the bill here.\n\n“A person is guilty of a misdemeanor who, with actual knowledge and intent to deceive, causes to be distributed or distributes, including distribution by mail, radio or television broadcast, telephone call, text message, email, or any other electronic means, including over the Internet, literature or any other form of communication to a voter that includes any of the following:\n\n(1) The incorrect location of a vote center, office of an elections official, satellite office of an elections official where voting is permitted, vote by mail ballot drop box, or vote by mail ballot drop-off location.\n\n(2) False or misleading information regarding the qualifications to vote or to register to vote.\n\n(3) False or misleading information regarding the qualifications to apply for, receive, or return a vote by mail ballot.\n\n(4) False or misleading information regarding the date of an election or the days, dates, or times voting may occur at a place described in paragraph (1).”\n\nThe expansion of the right afforded to voters to cast their ballots in this way is linked to the coronavirus epidemic – that is expected to lead to “a record number” of residents of this US state exercising their voter right in this way. At the same time though – the right of everyone else to be speaking out on the internet about this seems to be shrinking.\n\nAnd such is the level of journalistic standards upheld by CBS Los Angeles that they don’t even bother presenting the other view – namely, why is the “vote by mail” thing even controversial?\n\nInstead, we only get the usual talking point.\n\nUsually – or so we are led to believe – bickering and bitter arguments over some of the core mechanisms of organizing a fair and democratic election are merely the growing pains in very young democracies; for that reason, to see it play out prominently in the run-up to the US presidential vote this November is somewhat startling.\n\nAnd we are seeing it play out over and over again in campaign politics and media when it comes to the issue of mail-in ballots and possible ensuing election rigging.\n\nPresident Trump has not been known for mincing his words when it comes to the subject of expanding this kind of voting in November’s election. His main concern is that mail-in voting would “extend” elections beyond acceptable democratic standards, into weeks or even months after election day – implying that space would be created for election fraud, i.e., the “counting” until the votes had been counted “just right.”",

I’m non-black. I was told in the end I was ‘complaining too much.’ ”\"\n\nHer job was diversity, and she's been dabbling in politics ever since leaving the University of South Florida. No record of productive work.\n\nIs she a citizen? Not according to this clip from the internet.\n\nHard to see this person as essential. No evidence of any real function. She's an old maid spinster too by Bangladesh norms. Why is that? Another imported deviant, or just a devil woman no man wants any part of?",

Anywhere.\n\nA middle-school teacher in Tacoma has gone on a rant about President Trump to sixth-grade students during an online learning session after one of them said Trump was his role model. The student was temporarily kicked out of the class. The student’s mother is worried that her son was punished for expressing a valid opinion and that the school isn’t respecting free speech.\n\nOn October 2, during a virtual class, Brendan Stanton, a teacher at P.G Keithley Middle School, asked sixth-graders who their role models were.\n\nStanton asks students a daily question, which they are required to answer in an online chatroom. Last Friday, Stanton asked, “Who is the one person you admire and why?”\n\nThe student, whose name is withheld for privacy reasons, answered:\n\n“I admire Donald J. Trump because he is making America great again. And because he is the best president the United States of America could ever, ever have. And he built the wall so terrorists couldn’t come into the U. S. Trump is the best person in the world. And that’s why I had admire him.”\n\nThat answer triggered a response from the teacher. He called out the student for mentioning Trump, attacked the president, deleted the chat, and kicked the student from the class.\n\nThe student reported the incident to his mother, Elsy Kusander, who came to see what was happening, just as the teacher was ranting about the president. She recorded the incident on her phone.",
