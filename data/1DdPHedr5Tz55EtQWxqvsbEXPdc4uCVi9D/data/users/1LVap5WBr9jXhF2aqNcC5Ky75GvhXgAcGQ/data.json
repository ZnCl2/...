CodeMonkey just stated it was made by them and that's it. Doesn't mean its a honeypot its just fan-made.",

Eventually Jim himself will cave and he'll eventually have Ron Watkins order globals/mods to sanitize the chans. Its the inevitable fate for chan boards that get too popular to become like 4chan.",
