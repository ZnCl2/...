When my mother was dying, my dad lost his store and my home was kicking me out. I didn't have a choice but to ask around my circles for a job. Despite not having much room, Jim took me in, gave me some tasks and allowed me to keep both food and shelter in my life.\n\n>I don't get paid for the /v/ stuff, this is more of a hobby than anything. However I DO get paid for running some basic errands like claims and such, so that codemonkey can focus on more important things on 8chan and the other sites that he works on. Thanks to Jim and Ron, I'm able to safely live in this shit hole of a city with food on my plate and shelter over my head. \n\n>Unlike Frederick I can appreciate the shit Jim has done for me, and the only regret I have is that I couldn't tell people sooner. However due to wanting to avoid a potential exodus, Codemonkey wished for me to keep my job a secret. I disagreed with him, but I also respected his wishes. Now that Fredrick blackmailed me and basically leaked it to those in IRC. I figured it's basically a good time to tell you all the truth about how I get a bit of cash each month by helping out Codemonkey and Jim with basic errands for the site. I do NOT have higher access to certain information since I am a lower level employee. \n\nAfter asking, Mark basically confirmed that it mostly boils down to testing Ron's code on /v/ before it's rolled out site-wide.\n\nFigured the anons here would be interested in knowing.

Considering the fact that a child cannot legally consent, it's rape by definition, rape and child abuse all at once. No child was hurt in the act of drawing loli. There was no child to consent (or not consent) in the act of drawing loli. It is a victimless crime through and through.\n\nI don't really care about the \"hypocrisy\" or the situation one way or another. There's many arguments to be made over \"loli is pedo\". I can't speak for anyone else, but myself, I see the situation as \"pedo sure, but not a child molester\", and there's an important distinction there. Being a pedophile is not a crime (maybe in Germany, they specialize in Thought Crimes), but being a child molester - acting out on your pedophilia - that is a crime. The two terms are often conflated in society, which is where this confusion comes from. Saying \"loli is pedo\" is accusatory in nature, even if it's not necessarily intended.\nThat's how I see the whole situation, at least. \n\nEither way however, pedo or not pedo, loli is perfectly legal and \"eww, icky problematic drawing thought crimes!\" is what retarded Redditors and Twitter trannies do. They try to \"cancel\" people over problematic drawings of children all the time. Look at Shadman. Why even come here if you'll bitch about loli?",
