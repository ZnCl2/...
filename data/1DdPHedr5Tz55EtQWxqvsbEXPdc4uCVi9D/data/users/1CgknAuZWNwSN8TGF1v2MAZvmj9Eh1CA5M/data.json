Let's assume that means there are more people making shit posts than people making good posts. That may not be the case but I'm talking what if. They are the majority, and they have a system where they can perhaps inflict something into a certain user. In actuality, the HTML/JS/whatever of the board is well seeded enough that every post will always have seeds, but what if people instinctively ignore certain posts because their pictures don't load so fast? It could \"prioritize\" a few posts by practical positivity/negativity shown towards it.\nOn 8chan we had the hide button, in here we have the mute button. Even in bad boards with IDs such as **Mark's /v/**, with a hide button you would at most hide/mute that person for a single thread and not know who they are the next time over. Newfags were already advocating people ignore or hide everything they don't like, but in here the equivalent function is stronger, and the damage could be even worse. Imagine the echochamber potential. Imagine being unable to self moderate a board because after 1 or 2 posts you're just talking to the wind, and will be for a while.\nThat's all a what if, so that's good.\n\nMark fucking stickied an e-sports dota stream, he spills his spaghetti in threads and then nukes the thread itself, every time you triggered a hotpocket you'd get your post history erased. We had threads where people were replying to nothing because half of the thread was nuked and the ones who were there before the nuke didn't even understand why their or other people's posts were deleted. A hotpocket once made a CS:GO thread then banned any dissenters. Threads that should be out were allowed, threads that should be left untouched remained. I'm talking basic bitch shit here, people playing gachashit. It was basically cuck/vg/. We got shilled by /leftypol/ in specific extremely heavily between 2017 and 2018 and nothing was done about it, I hear it was looked into in 2019 but I barely posted on the website.\n/a/ is in a tipping point where they're almost SJWs. Their self cultivated hostility to 8chan at large has blown up now that they have their website and other boards are flooding into the meta thread. the current /a/ moderation has created that userbase, which can't even handle bants, the minimum requirement for posting on an imageboard. Shit talk an /a/non and It will become a contest for \"who said what mean thing\". Make a thread about classic anime and it gets shitposted to death, meanwhile every low budget seasonal isekai reaches the post limit and you do get banned for stirring anything on those threads.\nYou can't disagree with people on /pol/ or you get banned by the moderation or piled on by the userbase also created by the moderation.\n\n\nSimultaneously, 08chan is immune to bad board moderation. I think moderation has made larger boards such as /v/, /a/, /pol/, and /b/ unusable. That doesn't mean moderation is bad, but it seems that for the boards responsible for most of the traffic on the website, it went wrong and essentially crippled those boards, because /v/ and /a/ on 8chan never had good moderation and it only got to new levels of bad over time, /pol/'s moderation degenerated and killed it very quickly, /b/ is an exception moderation-wise in that it's really not the board that should be moderated to begin with, but dysnomia did it, and it was bad. Whatever happens here, the community is guilty of it. No moderators but ourselves to blame. \nThere's hope, unlike previously, since it seems bad moderators also have a tendency to want to squat on their position. Here we make our destiny and after we do that we see if we're good at it.\n\nI like the idea behind zeronet. If we can get this working well, and retain an userbase, then we have a small barrier of entry that will keep a portion of people who shouldn't be here anyway out while simultaneously aiding with the stability of this place and being more resilient to being taken down.\nThe post quality has been great, people just saying whatever comes to mind, a sense of community is there, the website owner has shown good ethic.\nI also like 8chan's owners, whatever complaints people had of them, they allowed us to have our free speech spot and dedicated their lives to it. Hotwheels was secretly gathering information on his users, and Jim had the whole /newsplus/ debacle. The last one is forgivable I'd say, and hotwheels is not related to 8chan anymore, so I think we went rather well unless I don't know about something horrible.",
