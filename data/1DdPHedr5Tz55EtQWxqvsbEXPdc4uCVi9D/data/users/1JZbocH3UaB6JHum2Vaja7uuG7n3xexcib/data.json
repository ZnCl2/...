You are confusing a non existent conspiracy with factual evidence. Even if there was some cabal of dark suits running the show trying to prevent daddy trump from being reelected that wouldn't, in and of itself, presume voter fraud. There's no evidence I have seen of the such.",

How does it feel to be eternally cucked? You have nothing. Trump was not a populist. He was Cult of Personality and a billionaire who fought for billionaires and working people who vooted for him are fools.",

I simply understand the material reality of a trump victory over a Biden one. Hence, my tactic support for Biden. Make no mistake, Biden is not going to solve, or, fix anything. Especially with how his cabinet is turning out. We, the left, should stop and nothing, but, totally dismantling the legitimacy of Biden and the democratic establishment such as we did trump.",
