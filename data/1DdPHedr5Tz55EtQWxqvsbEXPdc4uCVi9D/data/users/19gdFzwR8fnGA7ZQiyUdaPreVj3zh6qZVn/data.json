I always disconnect it whenever I'm not using Zeronet. \nAlso Since 2 days ago, something about the software has changed. My browsers keep getting stuck while having /pol/ threads open. Delays and spazzes galore. I'm going to disconnect, try to find the issue by myself and if I don't find it, not restart it for a few days. ",
