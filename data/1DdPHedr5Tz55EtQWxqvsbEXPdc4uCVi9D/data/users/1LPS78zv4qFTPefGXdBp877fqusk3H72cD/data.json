When we discuss semiconductor fabrication and dream about the day we'll be able to make semiconducting microdevices from the comfort of our own homes.\nI'll begin. Pic related is the die shot of a MOS 6581. What are these circles that appear all over the place? They seem to look like vias, but a die doesn't have bias, does it? (At least a chip that old, I guess the new ones have multiple conductive layers. Or did they have multi layer chips in the 80s already?)",
