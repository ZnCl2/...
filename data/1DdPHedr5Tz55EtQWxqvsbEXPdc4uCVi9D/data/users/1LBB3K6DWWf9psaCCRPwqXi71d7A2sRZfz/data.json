			"body": "Howdy folks, I come from 8chan as well since the purge. It's good to be here in the bunker with everyone who came here, and I think that maybe shills won't go THIS far to shit on this new site. If this site DOES fall, what is next? Is it over? I'm just glad we can all get back together. The true /pol/ members will surely migrate to here, hopefully. I probably sound too enthusiastic, sorry, but I am glad that this community won't be wiped off the face of the Earth. Cheers, all. To a new /pol/ board.",
