			"body": "'''In light of the recent Putnam County New York Red-Flag (ERPO) Law Alarm,'''\n'''there were some good points and some bad points about the whole thing.'''\n\nTakeaways from this (for me)\n> 1.) Pro - We CAN organize - it was rough, but folks DID show up at the cemetery.\n> 2.) Con - Those, \"Near or on the scene,\" if unable to do live video feeds, should record video, and then move to a location where the signal is not blocked to upload said video.\n> 3.) Con - I did not see any video from the cemetery location last night, nor from outside Booth's house until the police were gone.\n> 4.) Pro - (and most important I think) is that the police and other government offices were affected by the en-masse presence of social media, phone calls shutting down 911, Overwhelming phone calls to the police station, normies livestreaming about it - they had obstacles to surmount. People are pissed off with the Government - And it reared its ugly head last night.\n\nOne thing I would like to add is that:\na.) Individual threads on 4chan can be shut down\nb.) 4chan could be shut down\nc.) All discord users in a certain Discord can be banned at once\n\n__Bottom Line__\n== Communication could go dead ==\n\nThere are other options other than 4chan and Discord\nand I strongly suggest that those options should be agreed upon in a hurry.\nI, myself, can only suggest that places like ZeroNet should be seriously considered. (((They))) cannot shut that down.\n\nZeroNet is Peer to Peer and the boards and threads are not located on a centralized server like 4chan is. It is spread out.\nChinese (Hong Kong) activists are using this shit to bypass Government restrictions\nI will try to make a ZeroNet Comms Channel, but I am not good with html/java and don't know how to do it - or someone could just start a thread on ZeroTalk.\n\nSo, I am starting a Thread on here so that we have somewhere to coordinate, spread information, and share current communication channels with each other.\n\nNo reason to bump this thread before next habbening - Mods, just don't delete it from the catalog\n\n- - - - - - - - \n\nLaw enforcement had used signal-blocking devices that had blocked usage of Phone Data, WiFi, and may have possibly turned off the local HAM radio Repeater.\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\npic related is from - http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/234208329\nArchive - http://archive.md/eETRJ",

			"body": "Visiting Berlin in 1919 in the aftermath of Germany's defeat in the Great War, Kurt von Stutterheim found that \"all kinds of dubious resorts had sprung up like mushrooms\". Censorship had been relaxed, with the result that \"Notorious magazines, which no chief of police of former times would have permitted, were sold openly on the Potzdamer Platz\". Having already deplored the open display of these unnamed publications on the streets, Stutterheim could not resist going into the \"dubious resorts\" to see if they were any less shocking: \"An acquaintance took me into a  dance-hall where painted men were dancing dressed in women's clothes. I  was refused admission to another resort because it was only open to women, half of whom were dressed as men\" (STUTTERHEIM, 1939, p. 163). (He must have looked in the door and counted, or perhaps he asked a lesbian.) The whole of \"the public\" appears to be behaving like him, searching out the frisson of the abnormal: \"The German theater had become a home for the display of overheated and perverse sexuality, for which the public bought tickets with the expectation of witnessing something abnormal\" (STUTTERHEIM, 1939, p. 172). Market forces gave them what they wanted. \n\nmore in attached *.pdf file",

YES ! ! !==\n\n>    '''Testing underway for several potential coronavirus cases around DC region'''\n\n>    Health departments around the D.C. region are closely watching coronavirus developments, with testing happening in potential cases in the District, Maryland and Virginia.\n\n>    D.C.’s Health Department said, as of Tuesday, two people are awaiting results from testing, and one person has already tested negative for novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV.\n\n>    In Maryland, a state public health official said the testing of a resident for the new coronavirus is still underway — and, in the meantime, she explained what people can do to protect themselves.\n\n>    Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for public health for Maryland’s Department of Health, told WTOP that patient privacy prevented her from saying anything more about the identity or location of the Maryland resident who met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for testing on Monday, but that they were the first person in the state to be so tested.\n\n>    Those criteria include “flu-like symptoms and a travel history or recent contact with a confirmed case” of the coronavirus, Phillips said. A specimen was flown to the CDC in Atlanta to be examined, she said.\n\n>    The virus began in Wuhan, China, but has since spread to at least 13 countries. Thousands of people have been made sick, and more than 100 have died.\n\n>    Meanwhile, in Northern Virginia, a George Mason University student is “self-isolating” as they await results from the CDC, the university said Monday. The student does not live on campus.\n\n>    Two other people in central Virginia tested negative, state health officials said Monday.\n\n>    Phillips said though the coronavirus is powerful, it is not a completely unfamiliar.\n\n>    “The coronavirus is a large family of different respiratory viruses,” Phillips said. “We understand how they’re transmitted.”\n\n>    That means we understand how to protect ourselves. The steps are basically the same as with any other similar virus, such as the regular flu — “the same that we have recommended in the past,” Phillips said.\n\n>    First off, get a flu shot. “That’s a measure of protection that is unparalleled for [influenza],” she said.\n\n>    Hand-washing “can’t be beat,” she added — January is prime time for the spread of all kinds of viruses, and “there are viruses on surfaces throughout public spaces.”\n\n>    She added that you should stay home if you’re sick and “do everyone a favor and cough and sneeze into a tissue or into your elbow.” The “respiratory droplets” that you push into the air through coughs and sneezes can spread surprisingly far.\n\n>    Unless you have a diagnosed weak immune system, though, or you’re on medications that can lower it, you don’t need to wear a surgical mask in public, Phillips said.\n\n>    And, if you do have symptoms or the kind of travel history that puts you at risk, you need to see the doctor pronto.\n\n>    That said, Phillips added, “it’s important to call ahead to the facility where you’re headed, so they can take steps to make sure that you don’t inadvertently expose other people.”\n\n>    '''CDC response'''\n\n>    On Tuesday, the CDC announced some new steps they’re taking to fight the coronavirus. They’ve issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for all of China, meaning they recommend people avoid any nonessential travel to the entire country.\n\n>    The CDC is also screening arrivals at five U.S. airports that had direct flights from China – none of which are in the D.C. area. But they are monitoring for illness and providing educational materials for any travelers arriving from China at Dulles International Airport, which is one of 20 quarantine areas in the U.S.\n\n'''Source:'''  https://wtop.com/local/2020/01/testing-underway-for-several-potential-coronavirus-cases-around-dc-region/\n'''Archive:'''  https://archive.ph/Yov1M",
