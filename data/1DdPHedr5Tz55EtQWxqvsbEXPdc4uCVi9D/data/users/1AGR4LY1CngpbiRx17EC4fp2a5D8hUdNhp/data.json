Following this guide. \n\nI had it working on my last system, but I wanted to get rid of systemd.\n\nTor doesn't seem to be creating an auth cookie at all, nor can I get the daemon to load on boot.\n\nI get permission errors if I try to start the hidden service manually. If I'm doing this right, I'm new to OpenRC. I double-checked, and my user is in the tor group.\n\n~]$ /etc/init.d/tor start\nbash: /etc/init.d/tor: Permission denied\n\nand\n\nrc-service tor start\n * rc-service: Permission denied\n\n\nZeronet throws this error:\n\nTorManager Disabling Tor, because error while accessing Tor proxy at port 127.0.0.1:9050: No connection\n\n\nWhereas tor throws me a bunch of random permission errors, depending on what I'm trying to do.\n\nI also can't access zeronet from the actual tor browser itself either, but its working in other browsers. Yeah, I remembered to whitelist the zeronet port inside the tor browser.\n\nAny ideas? I've been digging through forum posts and scratching my head trying random things for a whole day now... This guide works great on my arch and debian boxes, maybe its something to do with me being a retard who doesn't know how to use OpenRC yet?\n\n",

The first two throw permissions errors.\n\nAnd yeah I did all the /etc/tor/torrc edits (uncomments, and added arguments)\n\nJust installed it manually straight from the tor website, since my last post.. same thing.. Tried AUR's copy of tor again as well.\n\nZeronet itself is working fine.. The problem is I can't get the tor hidden service to run, nor can zeronet seem to communicate with tor while running the browser manually. ",

I can execute the tor service from a terminal with \"sudo rc-service tor start\" but it does not initialize on boot. \n\nI've only been using OpenRC for like, two days.. Is there anything I need to do for it to load the service on boot, other than have an init script in init.d? \n\nEither way..
