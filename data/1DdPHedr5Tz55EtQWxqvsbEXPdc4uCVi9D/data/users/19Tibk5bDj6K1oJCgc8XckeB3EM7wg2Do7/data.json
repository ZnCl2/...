I unironically think this could be our chance. \n>apply as PMC firm\n>market ourselves exclusively to white Africans\n>do our jobs at extremely low rate in exchange for housing/ammunition\n>eventually gain enough capital to buy land\n>create /k/ompound, train locals in self defense and covert operations\n>become militarie sans frontiers\nFucking foolproof plan, we just have to figure out how to actually get there.\"",
