			"body": "It would be nice if there were different \"levels\" of blacklisting/muting so we could mute just the images & thumbnails of a particular user without muting the text or making the post invisible. Alternatively they could be treated like the \"always spoiler\" option, except just for those \"muted\" users instead of site-wide. I'm not sure exactly if ZeroNet can distinguish between the \"reason\" field of muted users when it comes to filtering content (it might just block all content of users on that list anyway), but if the muting process had a way to define specific reasons when adding the mute, there should be a way to call back to it and then have the site handle the content filtering options based on the mute reason.",

I'm still not read up on exactly how all of this work beyond poking around looking at some files and manually editing the filters.json file.\nI noticed that it is possible to seed files you haven't downloaded from ZeroNet yet if you have the exact same file (with same hash) and put it in the user's directory with the same file name. I wonder, if this program were to get a lot more sophisticated, if anyone would bother to implement a file de-duplication process. Considering the fact that over a long enough timeline, the size of the site will get rather large, and people do tend to re-use and re-post the same images/video (think reaction images, and Brenton's high score video). Being able to seed a file immediately because you already have it could speed the site up, especially with larger files. As I'm thinking about this, it seems like this would be just as well done by a separate program that could look for matching file hashes and automatically create a symbolic link to the existing file on your drive. hmmmmm",

			"body": "Best of luck to you anon. \nWhen you say you have a ballistic vest, do you mean soft body armor, or just an empty plate carrier? If you just have an empty carrier, I would advise stuffing something in there like part of a phone book or other material to at least serve to slow down or deflect any incoming rounds. Keep in mind that you typical nigger is going to be using some cheap/stolen hollow points (or perhaps they'll use FMJs, which would be more difficult to stop with improvised armor) but cheap hollow points tend to act like FMJs if they first hit something like thin sheet metal, so I would advise against using anything like that for armor. Lots of tough, thick, fibrous material could do the trick, though I'm not an expert in this area.\nAnother consideration is head protection. Anything to prevent you from getting knocked out if they clobber you in the head, even better if it helps deflect bullets away from your brain box.\nI also hope you have some kind of medical gear handy, preferably at least a tourniquet and gauze so you don't bleed to death if they hit an artery on one of your limbs. You'll need to buy yourself as much time as you can until an ambulance arrives (assuming calling an ambulance is even an option in your circumstance)\nIf they are attacking at night, don't underestimate the utility of light. If you have set up good choke points, you can direct bright lights (300+ lumens, but use the brightest ones you've got) at these entrances so that when they enter in from the dark they will be momentarily blinded and thus give you a tactical advantage. If it is bright enough it should impair their vision enough to affect their aim (implying niggers even aim), and in the least they should have a harder time seeing you in the dark.\nFinally, don't forget about battlefield pickups. If these niggers are coming at you with guns and you take the first one or two groids down with your mace or axe, utilize any safe opportunity to pickup their guns and use it against them. Just don't make yourself vulnerable while you bend over to pick that shit up.\nThose are all of the tips I can think of for you anon. God speed and keep us posted if you succeed.",
