			"body": "I like games with lots of character building options, so while I like the simpler mechanics and less emphasis on roleplaying that OSR games have I miss the crunch of looking over tons of material and carefully selecting options to create the character I want.\n\nThat being said, what OSR systems capture the modular feel of old D&D, where things like Psionics were their own self-contained subsystem that you could add to a campaign to radically change it mechanically? I really like the idea of a sytem WITHOUT a single unifying task resolution method, something where I roll for this, play cards for that and RPS for the other thing.",
