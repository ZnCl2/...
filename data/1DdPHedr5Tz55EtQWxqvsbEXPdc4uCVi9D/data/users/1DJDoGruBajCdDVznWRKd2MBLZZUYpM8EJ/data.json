God looks at the heart. Cripple had a chance at demonstrating strength of heart, character, and being a hero. Instead I'm pretty sure God is seeing a heart that's even more shriveled than the rest of cripple's body.",

It creates a folder with the thumbnails in it. If you find ones you want to delete, search your data folder for the corresponding filename(s) and go to town. I recommend learning to read the code too. It's easier than it probably looks at first glance. Just break it down into its parts. Left to right, top to bottom.",

			"body": "I'm curious, but I'll have to look more into this tomorrow. What I can tell you immediately is that Moarpheus is presumably a paid shill that's been hanging around half and fullchan for a few years now, as well as Gab. He tends to attack folks like Paul Nehlen and Patrick Little, blatantly making shit up and spinfoiling in order to delegitimize them. I say I suspect he's paid because he appears to do this full time, he's persistent as hell, doesn't appear insane, but still responds to replies to his posts.\n\nHere's an example of his stupidity:\nhttp://archive.is/d8SMw\nhttps://realmoarpheus.wordpress.com/2018/05/26/a-little-investigation/\n\nSo if they're accusing you of being him, then somebody probably wants people to think the email is real. Fact is, Shareblue hasn't been the group spamming the chans for awhile now. Some other group took over that job, but I can't remember what they're called off the top of my head. Hopefully another anon can remember.\n\nI just took a quick look at Stalwarts and my gut reaction is that it's a fake. The language seems forced and there are certain terms being used that I can't imagine anyone at Shareblue using. Speculating, but maybe it's a well-intentioned psyop by some Trump supporters? Also open the image up in GIMP and check the horizontal alignment of the paragraphs with a vertical guide. Several of the alignments are off, so I'm thinking photoshop. Hope that helps for now.",
