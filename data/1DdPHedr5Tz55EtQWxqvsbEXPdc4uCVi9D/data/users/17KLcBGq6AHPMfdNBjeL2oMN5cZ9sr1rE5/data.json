Her rewards are simple and so are my desires: intimacy with someone who isn't evil. I'll use Lesser Demonify to become cuter, but I want to remain in a form for optimal feeding so I'll have to work out the details with her.\n\n08Chan\nIt is convenient that once you view a file, you don't need to download it when accessing it again. However posting images from tor seems partially of broken: only the thumbnail seems to works. When posting CYOAs tor should be disabled unless this is fixed.\n\n~~Edit: The issue I ran into might or might not be due to tor. Spoke then realized I hadn't confirmed it enough to speak like I knew what I was talking about.~~",
