As a result I often get stuck or lost, and because of that I'm way overleveled now.\n\n>Thief Simulator\nIt's janky first person Unity indieshit, but still better polished than most games that fit this description. It's not an asset flip and the house designs make heists pretty fun and challenging. It can be pretty fun if the idea of a stealth-based loot grindfest sounds appealing to you.\n\nI also tried to get into Wolfenstein: TNO again after it was shilled in clearnet /v/, but just couldn't. It's way too shitty, has terrible and bland level design and some retarded mechanics for an action fps like having to press a key to loot weapons, ammo, armor and health.\n\n>>4b9a0942-7beb-49e4-ba0a-7959a07e2a2f\nIt's on my backlog, I'll probably start it sometime after I finish with Mary Skelter. I remember normalniggers being triggered by this game because of the way the witch protagonist treats the loli that helps her in some cutscenes.\n",

			"body": "**Hi guys, first post in the bunker** I'm actually pretty okay with this, and beginning to hope that this officially becomes the new /v/. Right now it's feeling pretty comfy without turbofaggots, underage kids and paid shills. Reminds me of the good ol' days. \n\nOf course the cancerous faggots will come if this catches on, I had never tried this Zeronet thing until today and it hardly requires any computer literacy at all. Fuck Tor, it's still centralized and hidden services are so fucking slow that it's unsuitable for an imageboard. Anyways, we should enjoy this comfiness while it lasts.\n\nI hope this whole debacle at least helps waking normalfags up to why full net neutrality is important - and also why anti-DDOS companies such as Cloudflare acting as the new gatekeepers of the internet are an even bigger threat than Google or Facebook, a point I've been trying to get accross for months. Even if they don't care about 8chan, it seems to have sparked some discussion.\n",
