A system log, indexing journal entry or a virus scanner just doing its thing could document its existence.\n\nThe only real solution i can think of is a VM with two OS's. One dummy, one hidden.\n\nIt is not unusual to have a toy VM that you do not do very much with, and it also allows you to use your normal environment with the hidden VM doing its thing in the background. \n\nThis allows you to seed all day, do your other activity in your actual system, and gives you the ability to hand over a password to your dummy VM OS, if law requires you to hand over a password upon request.",

Ability to store the board on a spare partition with plausible deniability to run it from Tails (8/10) [0]\nUse a VHD/VM, With a dummy/hidden OS. That way, All OS logs that could give away any hidden volume stay in the hidden OS. People have VM's that are hardly used and are just a toy/testing bed, so hardly having anything on the dummy can not be considered probable cause for a hidden OS.\n\n>5. Research the possibility of setting up a custom CA, which would make it possible to generate certs for every post, basically making everyone anonymous, but it would still be centralized and open to for example DDoS (7/10) [0]\nYou can have it where for each post, a new public key is generated. that way, the owner of the privet key can still edit there own posts while the public key's appear random for each post. When spam is detected, the CA refuses to accept any new public keys for that cert. This would however brake muting users, and move the site to central moderation.\n\n> 6. Research seed ratio based proof-of-work for posting, which would allow decentralized anonymous posting without additional CPU usage (9/10) [0]\nLook into Tribler. it is a fully decentralized torrent client, that uses seed based poof of work to kick out Torrent Leechers.",

You could of just pointed this out there (as you did) and/or, leave a courteous comment here saying, \"we are also working on this solution\" and called it a day. \n\nBut instead, You felt the need to call this board retarded, claim you  already have \"these lists\"\n>(\"reason\": \"L0:Pedo\") not found in the file. \nlinked your repo and your 08ch.net pet project, and recommended \"your\" solution over this.\n\nThis said, any effort to make moderation easier is welcome, and here is why this is fundamentally different;\n\nA. This blacklist is built with transparency in site, and it Is solely to list users that are at a high risk of posting content that is illegal to distribute, with different legality tears.\n\nB. Your blacklist just states.\n>\"reason\": \"Bad User\", \nIs is not very helpful.\n\nC. To check the list, you recommend using custom software. This is something a lot of anon's, including me, are not going to do unless it gains a good reputation. \n>tl;dr: use this totallynotavirus.exe\n\nD. Your blacklist is very large, and i suspect there are some personal blocks in their from the anon that submitted it. Again. \"Bad User\" is not very informative.\n\nE. This method allows the community to moderate, report, and plug in users as they go in a transparent manner.\n\nI will however look forward to having usernamesareover's tool audited by other anons, as it would be very useful.",

That will allow you to choose what depth of blocking you desire. If (and only if) this can be done I may also add the following levels as well.\n\nMay add category; Likely illegal. but I don't have any clear universal guidelines to mind. Will think about it more before doing this. One thing I can think of is things like file sharing links that you could get done for if you personally distribute them.\n\nAlso Spammers may be added later , But only if it is beyond a reasonable doubt that they are a bot, Or a user that just keeps spamming the board with nonsense, on more than 3 separate occasions.\n\nNote: nonsense is defined as;\n>Repetitive flood posting.\nOr \n>Repetitive advertising of any site/zite/board across multiple posts/boards.\nThat reasonably can be seen as unconstructive and universally annoying.",
