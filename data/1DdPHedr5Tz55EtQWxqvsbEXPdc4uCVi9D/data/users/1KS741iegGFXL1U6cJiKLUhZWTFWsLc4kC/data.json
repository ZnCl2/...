As soon as they run out people willing to pose as leaders, they can start cracking down on anyone else they find guilty in whatever crime they want to pin on you (so wrongthink). We used to think that they couldn't touch peer to peer technologies, too, but they put a lid on that pretty quickly.",

Even if they don't actively put anyone who uses it into prison, it's still monitored whenever anyone uses them, and not as active as it used to be. Wouldn't it be just as easy for them to pass a few \"anti-hate\" laws, and then start arresting anyone who dissents too hard, all the while shilling here?",

So my guess is that you deleted your \"history\", or whatever you call it here, and none of the peers that you shared those images with are reachable, either. Or they deleted all files that they have saved, but didn't purge the non-optional stuff that zeronet keeps saved on their hard drive.\n\nEDIT: And yeah, 0 seeds for every picture is a problem on small boards. Try to hang around after posting an image to increase the chances of its survival.",

I assume that the way it works is similar to double NAT hiding the IPs of end users, so perhaps it is capable of protecting your server from DDoS if you somehow manage to put it behind cuckflare entirely and don't let it broadcast its IP into the open network at all, but I have no idea if that is even possible. ISPs can do it with their end users, though, so perhaps.",
