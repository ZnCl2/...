It was a solution that was figured out by reading ZeroNet's documentation, so it's possible it has never been done before on other zites (or it has been done on very few). The errors are probably harmless, and if they're indeed caused by this hack there's no other known way to solve this issue without changing ZeroNet itself or just making the old threads and posts invisible again.\n>our /tech/ guy is a useless tranny probably \nThere's no \"/tech/ guy\". And even if there was, ZeroNet is a whole different ballgame than regular websites. There's just one guy on the board who seems to be familiar with ZeroNet and Millchan from before 8chan shut down. Everybody else is still figuring out what's pretty much an experimental technology.\n>But overall, zeronet does not seem to be very well written.\nMaybe, but it's still the only alternative there is for what it does. IPFS is supposed to do the same things, but it's an even immature project.\nNNTP (and consequently nntpchan) is also interesting as a more lightweight and simpler alternative for decentralized message boards, so you might want to look into that.",
