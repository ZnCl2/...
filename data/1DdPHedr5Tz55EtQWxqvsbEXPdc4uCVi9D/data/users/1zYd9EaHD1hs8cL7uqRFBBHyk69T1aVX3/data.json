I didn't think there was anyone actually retarded enough to believe that anyone wants to shut down 8chan because they honestly believe that shitposting on the Internet makes people go out and shoot up a walmart.\nGet it into your thick head, Mark: The people against 8chan hate you even more than /v/ does. They want corporate-controlled safe spaces, not open discussion about any topic whatsoever. Stop stabbing anons in the back you fat fuck.",

You give a certain amount of storage and bandwith to the network, and it stores, encrypted, whatever it wants to. Which is good because it means basically guaranteed seeds for everything. It's also bad because CP, but if it's encrypted and nobody can prove you have it or know that you have it, then what's the problem?",
