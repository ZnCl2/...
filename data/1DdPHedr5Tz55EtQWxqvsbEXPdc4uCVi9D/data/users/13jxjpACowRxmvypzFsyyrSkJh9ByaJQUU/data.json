Before those Snowden revelations, some might have considered US telco gear as clean. \"Neutral Ground\".\n\nNow you see the consequences for our buttsniffing sins. No one trusts us. And the other evil prick sells below production cost.\n\nThis still could be turned around, but it requires sweeping away these rent seeking monopolists and replacing our curent system with a public one. Built with open standards, and distributed at no cost to the public.\n\nThink of a \"cellular system\" built from millions of home routers tied to landline broadband pipes. Access to that network would be free - and TOTALLY secure.\n\nRequires that we walk the walk in regards to our Bill of Rights and traditions. FBI, CIA, NSA not allowed. \n\nTheir cost to us is now immeasurable.",

			"body": "May 28, 2020\nBahia Beach, Puerto Rico\n\nDuring the summer of 1215 in a riverfront meadow near London, some of England’s top barons gathered to confront King John and force him to sign a contract guaranteeing their rights and freedoms.\n\nThe contract became known as the Magna Carta. And one of its key provisions (#43) gave the Barons protection against something called ‘escheat’.\n\nIn medieval times, ‘escheat’ referred to property being forcibly passed to the King if its original owner died without heirs.\n\nSo if a Baron passed away without a son, his domain would pass by escheat back to the crown.\n\nOver time, kings vastly expanded the use of escheat; anyone convicted of a crime would have their property seized by escheat. Occasionally someone’s son or daughter could be pressed into servitude by escheat.\n\nIt was like a medieval version of Civil Asset Forfeiture: the King took whatever he wanted, for any reason, and people had no rights.\n\nBy 1215, England’s noblemen were sick and tired of it, and they successfully forced King John to sign the Magna Carta.\n\nUnfortunately for the other 99.9% of England’s population, most of the Magna Carta’s guarantees only applied to Barons and other noblemen.\n\nPlain ole’ regular serfs still had their meager property plundered by the King, and by the noblemen themselves who had just fought to preserve their own rights at the expense of everyone else’s.\n\nSo if a feudal serf in England died without an heir, or was convicted of a crime, all his property was escheated to the local Lord, or to the King.\n\nThis became such big business in England that the government appointed special agents called ‘escheators’ in every single English county to oversee property confiscation every time someone passed away.\n\nIf there was any doubt at all whether or not the deceased had valid heirs, the escheator would seize the property immediately.\n\nAmazingly enough, this ridiculous feudal custom still exists. And not just in England-- in many countries around the world.\n\nIn just about every state in the Land of the Free, for example, your possessions, real estate, etc. are forfeited to the government if you die without heir.\n\nEven bank accounts that are left dormant for some period of time-- usually a few years-- can be confiscated by the government.\n\nBut this is totally bizarre, because ‘dormant bank account’ rules can be incredibly loose. In many jurisdictions, for example, simply having some savings stashed away in a bank account that doesn’t have any other activity can put your funds at risk of being seized.\n\nThey actually still use the same word-- escheat. So money in dormant bank accounts is escheated to the state.\n\nTo be fair, this practice has been relatively rare… until Covid. But now governments are starting to look at every source of funding they can get their hands on, including the medieval ones.\n\nThe British government recently announced that they had “unlocked” £150 million from dormant bank accounts, with cooperation from some of the biggest banks in the UK, all to help fight World War Covid.\n\nAnd now the UK is looking to expand the practice beyond bank accounts; they’d like to be able to seize unclaimed financial assets (including stocks and bonds), insurance proceeds, and even dormant pension accounts.\n\nAs one UK government official put it, “I look forward to the potentially millions more we can unlock for good causes through expanding the Dormant Assets Scheme.”\n\nThis is a practice that literally dates back to the feudal system. And it reinforces a simple truth: you don’t really own anything if the government has the authority to take it.\n\nI have no doubt the bureaucrats who came up with this idea have very good intentions.\n\nAfter all, what nobler cause is there in this bizarre world of ours but to wage an endless crusade against the Coronavirus, no matter the cost?\n\nThey’re willing to do whatever it takes, spend whatever it takes, print as much money as it takes, and yes, even confiscate people’s private property, to rid the world of the virus.\n\nThis is our new reality: medieval serfdom.\n\n\n\nMy note to the friend who sent me this:\n\nThey don't fear us XXXX. We've allowed this to happen.\n\nI understand you think I'm fucking crazy, but this shit would stop if the prospect of being \"McVeighed\"  was real. Should give you insight of where that \"pried from my cold dead hands\" comes from.",

After all, it's not a big stretch to see police doing something like that  to a white.\n\nLogically, whites should move against police and police enablers whenever they are forced to pay these $3 million settlements from taxes. Would improve the breed.\n\nBut practically, response to police atrocities upon whites would be limited to assassinations and/or bombing of police facilities - usually by the family of the deceased.\n\nHave never understood these nigger looting frenzies. That's a nigger thing apparently. Nor can I understand a black parent accepting money for the life of their son. A white parent would ALWAYS demand blood.\n\nThere is hope and whites show the way. A sheriff's deputy broke into the home of a felon down in Texas at 2AM.  That deputy was shot and killed. Needless to say, the entire government of that county wanted this felon's head.\n\nThe grand jury \"no billed\" him. Complete exoneration. Zero consequences for the felon.\n\nI think of that every time I see these \"heroes in their own mind\" breaking into houses in the news. Each time, I hope it ends up as another Alamo - with a high death count for the police. And I don't care if a nigger does this.\n\nThere was a case in Houston I believe which is now unraveling. Undercover police shot and killed a 60yo white man and his wife after bursting into their home. No drugs were found and I believe the old geezer wounded several police before he was killed. Keep seeing these new revelations which suggest those cops will soon be charged with murder. They lied and lied and lied.\n\nA better outcome would be the family of that killed white man killing the police perps and their families. Examples must be made. No mercy.",

It's more like a crushing and overwhelming sense of indifference served with a delicious side order of TOLDJASO.\n\nI just don't give a fuck.\n\nYou’re all dumb fucks, and since there's no cure for dumb fuckery, and dumb fuckery cannot be fixed, and it's pointless to feel even a moment of anxiety over what you can't cure, control or fix -- my give of fucks is officially empty.\n\nYou idiots vote to make Keith Ellison -- a woman-beating Antifa supporter -- your goddamned attorney general, and then I'm supposed to give a fuck when Antifa loots and burns your city and state????\n\nDon't make me laugh. Because that's what you’re doing, you know -- you're making me ROFLMFAO.\n\nI also don't give a fuck because I live in flyover country, I live in a neighborhood filled with security lights, dogs, and unregistered firearms. So if a gang of Antifa cocksuckers comes by, they’re going to feel the full-Peckinpah before they even have time to call and ask their moms to pick them up.\n\nI might even throw in a Yee-hawwww between shotgun pumps.\n\nNot that Republicans don't suck, but it's a binary choice, and I've spent decades warning people about the price you pay for voting for feckless Democrats -- these obscene gangsters who arrest people for going to church in their cars but do nothing as predominantly-white Antifa thugs burn and loot black neighborhoods -- because white Democrats have been terrorizing black America since 1776.\n\nI'm supposed to give a fuck when CNN's Atlanta headquarters is attacked -- you mean attacked by the very same thugs CNN created? Yeah, I give a fuck like I give a fuck when Frankenstein's monster comes for Frankenstein.\n\nI'm supposed to give a fuck when the College Hall of Fame is destroyed?\n\nHey, maybe don't build Hall of Fames in Democrat-run cities, dumb fucks.\n\nHow does it feel to oppose the NRA now, dumb fucks -- you know, as you sit at home helpless in a city that's been run exclusively by Democrats for 50 years, a city where the police murder black people and then run away like bitchez when the riots and looting starts, run away to leave you and your home and business and family to fend for yourself without so much as a shotgun.\n\nOh, you’re really OWNING the Orange Bad Man now, aren't you -- you dumb fucks.\n\nThese riots are not America's problem and they SURE AS HELL aren’t my problem.\n\nYou get what you vote for, and you assholes voted for obscene leftists, for Democrats who fund and encourage Antifa, and now you can all reap the whirlwind while I eat caramel corn and watch Hogan's Heroes.\n\nI just don't give a fuck. I got mine, bitchez. I worked hard for it. I spent 100 hours a week for 16 years trying to warn y'all…\n\nReap it, you dumb fucking dumb fucks.\n\nP.S. Trump should play 18 holes today and let the Antifa-loving Democrats and the dumb fucks who voted for them deal with their own problems.",
