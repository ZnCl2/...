As he was drowning he has seen a shining green orb in the deep sea. The pressure of the water as he descended onto the depths made him closer to it, and made his face shine brighter. As soon as he collapses against this shining object, a bright light blinds him. He wakes up in a watermelon field.\nSeeing that the fields were endless and nobody was around, the nigger decided to start eating the watermelons. One by one they were getting eaten up, seeds were spit, and rests were left over the place.\nBut the negro also started to worry, as much as he ate, he was also generating a lot of rubbish. This made him even more suspicious when the rubbish started twitching itself, very rarely, it moved just a parsec of a second. \nAfter having eaten up 30 kilometers of watermelons, he ended up like Fat Albert, but still could walk. But deep in the distance, there was a hill growing of watermelon carcasses, seeds, and rotten fruit. \nFlies started to swarm everything, and the sky started to turn from a clear cyan to a wasted grey. The fields no more were green and feverish, they were dry and the fruits had the skin of an elder, wrinkled and smooth. \nFrom the hill of garbage, a demonic possesion started to appear. It was an event, or was it a man? It was something undescribable, but as soon as he has seen it, his eyes started to flash images he couldn't get away from. He started to see red faces shaking hard while screaming with what sounded destroyed decibels, the white noise of saws and murdered cows roaming from the left to the right ear. A thousand hands gripping onto a wall of skin trying to stretch it outside. \nThe nigger started to punch himself in order for this demonic possesion to stop altering his perception of reality and thought. He tried incredibly hard but in the end, after letting himself go blind from unmanaged fists to his forehead, he let his demons go.\nNow he's left to wander through purgatory made by himself, he can only presume what lies forward, but the only thing that he can know for sure is that he isn't getting out of it any soon.",
