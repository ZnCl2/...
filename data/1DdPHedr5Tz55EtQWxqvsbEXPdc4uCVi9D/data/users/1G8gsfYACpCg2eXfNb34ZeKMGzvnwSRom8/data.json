As far as reasons why, I've seen the more /x/-leaning Anons propose the theory that the world '''did''' end back on 2012, but not in the way we expected. As for my opinion, I think 2012 was pretty much when \"modern society\" hit it's peak as far as \"progressing further\", meandered around for a couple years, and then plunged (hard) because no one had any idea of where it is that we could go next. After all, Steve Jobs pretty much ushered in the \"modern\" way of thinking (Which other companies senselessly copied without paying any attention to the '''reason''' why Jobs created such a revolution) and, after he died,  no one knew (**Actually, it's more like they never ever thought about**) where to go next and progress came to a screeching halt. And, the solution for these baizuo was crank everything up to 11 and shove the beliefs of progressivism down the throats of everyone in sight.\n\nOn top of all that, 2012 was around the time that the tech companies really started to lose the mask and show their true colors:\n==Sex, Drugs & Silicon Valley==\nhttps://archive.fo/X6vFj\n==FTC To Silicon Valley: Tech Companies Should Protect Consumer Data==\n>January 28, 2010\nhttp://archive.fo/h1Nc1\n==FTC seeks to rein in Facebook==\n>January 13, 2012\nhttp://archive.fo/eil2e\n==Silicon Valley billionaires believe in the free market, as long as they benefit ==\n>3 February 2014\nhttps://archive.fo/CZhmQ\n==Google 'illegally took content from Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor,' report finds==\n>20 March 2015\nhttp://archive.fo/RWDYx\n==CIA: We have a lot in common with Silicon Valley==\n>June 16, 2015\nhttp://archive.fo/ASEgW\n\nBy the way, as an added bonus, did anyone know what happened '''ON THE SAME EXACT FUCKING DAY''' as when the Pentagon announced that they cancelled the \"Lifelog Project\": https://archive.fo/wJ26p\nFacebook was created: https://archive.fo/zDaqy",

When recently reading through a book that was telling the \"common\" tales of Greek myth, one of the things the author had to say (On more than one occasion) is that all these tales are considered to be complete fabrications by modern historians...until they started unearthing artifacts that lend credibility fact that the tales being read about actually ==did== take place. **But, then the guy backtracked on those comments in other chapters by stating that the entire construction of the Greek myths is based the “patriarchal and classest” society that Ancient Greece was.** And, this isn't the only source of myths actually being true historical fact. Much of the Bible was considered to be mostly fairy tales as well, until they started finding evidence (Especially in other societies) that the nations and actions that happened in the Bible actually are a part of history. Hell, even recently, they found the head stone to the '''literal''' “Snow White” (A tale that created 207 years ago and is considered to be a classic fairy tale with literally no basis in reality): http://archive.fo/ah6H3\n\nNow, I'm starting to get off topic, but the point I'm trying to make is that before we actually start going down the road of arguing “Does God exist”, shouldn't we first back up and start going over “fantastical history” that ancient societies have already written down and are having an ever increasing amount of evidence proving that those myths actually did take place (And trying to figure out where the “fantastical” nature of the world disappeared to)?\n\n>>e554afc1-ac85-4caf-8b37-af56a1bb9f92\nYou can't, that's why concepts such as gravity still exist as a theory.",

If you bring up that you only seed what you see, you can have all images spoilered, and the various ways you can mute users and delete files, they move onto complaining about something else. A lot of these Anons posting about the issues with 08 are starting to seem less like they're confused about the site and more concerned with slandering it for whatever reason (Which has led me to believe that they're either shills or bad faith actors).\n\nThus far, I have only seen '''two''' legitimate concerns with 08. The first is the sites coding (Which everyone can agree on). The ==second== complaint, however, is the possibility that Tor and VPNs are compromised. As far as I know, the only source of information is a supposedly \"leaked\" document (See pic) that was distributed throughout a real government organization: http://archive.fo/DriNo\nAt the moment, the information in the document has neither been confirmed or denied (As well as the original source still remaining a mystery), but it does show the inherit problem that if Tor and VPNs are compromised (And, as of this moment, they '''are''' the ''ONLY'' other options that we have), we are screwed.",

First:\n> If the goal of this group is motivated by such an agency agenda, then posting a shit ton of loli hentai at them isn't going to change their mind, '''but it may give them ammunition to use in their subversion.'''\nWhat \"ammunition\" is it going to give to the spooks that they don't '''ALREADY''' have? Second:\n> However, I do believe that it was 'your kind' who posted a bunch of loli traps with the intention of driving \"boomers\" away.\nAre you honestly one of the Q fags? Then, yeah, I do have an intention to drive you retards out for falling for a LARPer. You jackasses are the '''REASON''' shit has gotten to the point it has over the past few decades, and, rather than actually try to fix shit, you're more focused on worshiping some idiot based out of Ohio making Trump memes. The ''ONLY'' good you fags have done is kill that one mob boss and ==THAT IS IT!== Third:\n> I'm not saying you shouldn't ever be able to post them - I am simply saying that if you were trying to encourage people to sign up for the blacklisting service, then you're doing a good job of it by behaving as you are, and this is precisely why I am saying what I am.\n==I'm not encouraging anyone to sign up.==\nIf I do show people the bunker, I'm going to leave it as their options being a \"Take it or leave it\" stance. Going by all the other organizations that I am involved with, those that \"adapt\" lose '''everything''' that made them prideful, meanwhile those that stick to their principles last for decades. Imageboards were born out Japanese message boards, weebshit, and gaming, with a dash of politically incorrect attitudes. If ''ANYONE'' has a problem with '''ANY''' of those being posted, then you can ==FUCK OFF== for being the type of fag that has destroyed the world already. Fourth:\n>However, I also recognize that if ZeroNet is to become more popular and ultimately replace the internet (which it should), then there are people who do not want loli traps to be downloaded by their computer, at all, nor do they particularly care to see them and would also like to have measures in place to not have their kids bombarded with it, as well.\n==If the fags don't want it, then don't direct them to this site!== Fifth:\n>though, again, not sure posting lolis would really make much of a point\n==The point is to prove that we still have unlimited freedom of speech. The moment obscene drawings are considered a crime, then we know that the Kikes have finally gained a foothold and are going to increasingly push everything further in their general direction.== Sixth:\n>If I go to 08chan, I don't really have an expectation of decency. If I were to go to, say, 0tube (or whatever they call it) and get full on pornography and snuff porn... some compartmentalization between a porn zite and a social media zite should exist - and some means of enforcing that, at least on a user level should exist.\nAt what point did the internet need to \"censor\" itself to become \"socially acceptable\"? Last I remember, '''EVERYONE''' was making themselves a website (No matter how \"acceptable\" it was) back before the Dotcom crash. YouTube became popular with '''EVERYTHING''' ranging from simple advertisements, to gameplay videos, to 9/11 truthers, to a couple of softcore snuff and porn vids; and they only started censoring everything once advertisers got involved. Even cuckchan still had ''SOME'' semblance of intact culture (Of what is and isn't acceptable) after the \"Hackers on steroids\" and iPhone boom, and only lost everything the moment they started censoring everything on the site. Long story short, it seems like things become popular ''WHEN'' censorship is almost non-existent.\n\n**And, this is also leaving out the fact that it seems like you retards cannot grasp the very reason why things are fun or funny in the first place.**\n\n==TL;DR: FUCK OFF AND CONTINUE BEING AFRAID OF A FUCKING DRAWING; YOU SODOMIZING, RETARDED, FUCKING FAGGOT OF A KIKE!!!==",
