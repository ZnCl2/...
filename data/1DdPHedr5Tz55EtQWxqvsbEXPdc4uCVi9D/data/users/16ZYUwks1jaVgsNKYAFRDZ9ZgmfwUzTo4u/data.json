Don't bother trying to defend yourself if you actually have a twitter, reddit, or Facebook account, because in that case, your opinion is less than meaningless to me - it is actively subversive. I hate the way most people conduct themselves online and frankly, I don't want fucking anything to do with them because they're the kind of people who drove me off the internet in hte first place/\n\n>>de16bf26-61c7-47e3-9b63-98d4d1653a78\nFace it, decentralized imageboards are the only true way forward. Unless some autist gets their shit together and really makes an anoynmous darknet imageboard, any and all imageboards can be targeted and your only hope is to escape to smaller and smaller imageboards or leave the clearnet altogether. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be many of us left here because of the security concerns. I hate talking to people in most channels, so it's vital that we get a truly anonymous decentralized imageboard running so I can tell Mark that his mother caught cancer from giving birth to him without getting banned.",
