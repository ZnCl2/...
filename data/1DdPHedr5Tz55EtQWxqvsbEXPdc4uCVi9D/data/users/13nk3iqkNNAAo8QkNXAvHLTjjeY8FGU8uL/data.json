			"body": "I have one written down for meals; it's one that my grandfather used to use all the time, so I thought it good to write it down. Other than that, for personal prayers I usually use either the Jesus Prayer or the Lord's Prayer, and for group prayer's I just wing it based on the group and recent events. \nReally and truly, praying is not very difficult, most prayers should be short and to the point, a good template for group prayers would be \"Thank you Lord for X, please bless/help us with X, please watch over X. In your name we pray, Amen\". For personal prayer, you seem to have a good grasp on it, taking inspiration from scripture and adding a meditation on faith.",
