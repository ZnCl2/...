			"body": "In another bizarre performance on NBC news programming, former FBI Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Frank Figliuzzi claimed that President Trump may have ordered flags flown at half staff not to honor the victims of the Dayton and El Paso shootings, but rather to celebrate Adolf Hitler.\n\nFigliuzzi explained the reasoning behind his conspiracy theory, claiming that the date the flag is to be at half staff until, August 8 (8/8), is a neo-nazi calling sign because the eighth letter of the alphabet is H, which stands for Hitler, and 8/8 means ‘Heil Hitler.’\n\nYes, somehow it is even a white supremacist act now to have flags flying at half-staff in honor of victims of a white supremacist murderer.\n\nLets skip over the fact that Figliuzzi looks downright creepy, and blinks about a million times in that clip, as if he’s attempting to hypnotize the audience into believing his crackpot nutbaggery.\n\nRemember that Alex Jones is BANNED from all social media, while Figliuzzi is PAID to spew this droolstack on a platform owned by NBCUniversal, one of the largest companies on the globe.\n\nAnd it isn’t an isolated incident. Figliuzzi vomits out this kind of bile pile every day.\n\nEarlier in the week, Figliuzzi described Trump as a ‘radicalizer’ for white supremacists, and directly compared him to an extremist Islamic cleric inspiring Muslims to commit acts of violent Jihad.\n\nMeanwhile, NBC chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel was literally flown to a neo-nazi festival in Germany, where he concluded that Trump is inspiring hate and the ‘inspiration to murder’ among white supremacists in Germany.\n\nAnyone would think that these former intelligence officials now working in news are deliberately feeding real white supremacists with such theories in order to rile them up.\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-08-07/former-fbi-official-raves-trump-ordered-flags-flown-half-staff-honor-hitler\n\nThey're completely fucking unhinged.\n",
