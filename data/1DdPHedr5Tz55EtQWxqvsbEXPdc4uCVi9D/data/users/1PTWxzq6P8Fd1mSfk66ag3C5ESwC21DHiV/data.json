We're now completely without moderation oversight here, something that could have happened a long time ago if we truly wanted it but we were content to enjoy ourselves on a centralized board with (((questionable))) administration and moderation. They pushed us to this. All we want to do is post nazi anime girl memes in peace. Now it's time for war. Awoo",

OMEMO is actually a lot better in many ways.\n\nFunny enough, it's entirely possible to use OTR on discord. Using something like libpurple with discord integration, it's possible to connect discord to pidgin or even bitlbee and use OTR and a regular irc client to talk on discord. Hell, you can even use fishlem like the old days :D",
