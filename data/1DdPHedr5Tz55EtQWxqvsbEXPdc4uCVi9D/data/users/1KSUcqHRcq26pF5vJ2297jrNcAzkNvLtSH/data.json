In order to post about it I did it through the old 08chan cert by switching back to the spammable system for a few minutes.  I'm not surprised the post vanished when I switched back to ZeroID.\n\nThe perma-fix for this will be to basically copy ZeroID's functions into 08chan's cert generation.  So you visit 08chan once over the clearnet, get a cert, and then go back to TOR and/or VPN and be good to go.  I want to configure it so that it resets once per day, so that anons can still dump their old certs and \"post histories\" daily if they like.\n\n>>37919ac3-7b82-4ef5-845c-712c7f4023b1\nI think you're correct, but in a different sense than what I'm wanting to do.  All the original users have the full data of 08chan, its just that new certs aren't downloading it.  It should be possible to let everyone get a copy of everything and then proceed forward with only ZeroID (or 08chanID if it can be implemented) from there on.  ",

Now that posting is fixed, the next goal is parsing millchan's data for their TOR image fix and implementing it.\n\nDon't get too envious of Millchan.  Their current model is actually pseudo-centralized - what they call a \"merger\" system, and it apparently gives board owners the kind of moderating powers they'd have on a normal website.  i.e. the ability to actually remove and censor content.  That's a hard no.  Implementing QoL features onto this site's backbone will be slower, but we're going to keep it self-moderated and uncensorable. ",

It ''appears'' that Millchan changed their entire file structure to accommodate their new additions.  We may end up looking at an all-or-nothing choice.  But if we have our own hub, it should be relatively trivial to disable the merger mechanics that grant moderator powers.  That then leaves the question of \"will the site still work for everyone?\"\n\nI want everyone to take plenty of time thinking about it and maybe testing the millchan patch that /tech/ made.  Is potentially breaking what we have worth it for a chance at TOR images and the extra functionality offered?  ",
