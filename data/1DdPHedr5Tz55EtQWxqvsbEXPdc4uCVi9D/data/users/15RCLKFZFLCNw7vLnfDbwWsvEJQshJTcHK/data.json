The consensus concerning 8chan/qanons coming from different sources seems to be this interesting synopsis...\n\n1. the chan was nearly taken down by the cabal once before. Meaning: The qanons are doing great damage to cabal, even though we may not see it.\n2.Qteam/patriots, knew qanons ie, /qresearch, would become a target once again as things heated up for the cabal, due to the info coming out of the chans. \"What does a cornered animal do\"?\n3.Qteam got intel of what the cabal was up to...They were planning to drop a nuke on 8chan via FF's, to shut us patriots down due to the Epstein and Cummings digs..nerves were hit, deep.\n4. Q dropped us a warning that we all misunderstood. \"Hunters become the hunted\"...That was a reference to US, a warning!  We are now the 'hunted', not the cabal.  \n5. Qteam gave the cabal a '''[24 hours]'''\"deadline\".  Meaning...\"We know what you are about to do.  You have 24hrs. to cease and desist or suffer the consequences\" [something like that].  Well cabal did not listen...do they ever, they are mindless Liberals.\n6. So...cabal drops FF's and chan nuke which are all tied in together via phony 'manefesto' setup.  \n7. POTUS closes the trap the qteam warned the cabal about, and the chan was the bait in his speech 8/5...\"Terrorists/White Supremists, DEATH PENALTY\".\n8. We anons/8chan are now tagged via MSM as \"terrorist insurgents/white supremacists\".\n9. How do you legally submit evidence?...You accuse an innocent party of a crime, and they bring all their documentation into court to defend themselves....[KEK]\n10. '''BOOM!'''\n11.Q warned them [cabal], they did not listen.  Now, they are fugged.  They have no way out of this mess. With what POTUS stated in speech, every person, who had any part in any FF/terrorist event, [crisis actor, planners, Walmart CEO's, bus drivers...anyone, who knowing participated in an event to \"terrorize, frighten, scare, cause emotional harm, etc. to the American people or 'elsewhere'...can be convicted, and if found guilty, be put to death!\n12. The saga continues to unfold.....\n\nThis is but the synopsis of what I gleaned from about a dozen intelligent minds all coming from differing angles, but concluding nearly the same things.\nJus an FYI\nDamn I love this movie.\nAny thoughts?\n\nNOTE...not famefagging here:  Ran across \"Cory's Diggs\". She may even be an anon here...uses chan chatter I noticed.  Looked at her very extensive research on her site into Epsteins \"Zorro Ranch\", which we do not have much on I don't think.  Damn, she has gone wide and deep on that.  So jus a heads up, cause I don't believe in reinventing the wheel here.  There may be much to wabbit trail off of her already deep digs.",
