And you notice that when you go to some other imageboards and see the stark difference in the quality of the posts. But there are also too many newfags who don't know any better and imitate the shills, so it's hard to gauge what is shillposting and what is just newfaggotry.",

I don't think threads with more posts are inherently more worthy of not dying. But if you wanted to prioritize threads with high post count I'm sure you could modify Millchan to tell ZeroNet to delete low post count threads first when running out of space.",

I don't know if there even is a way of not storing all post histories locally though, since currently data.json files are marked as 'required' files, and I don't know if it'd be possible to mark them as optional and still have the site work.",
