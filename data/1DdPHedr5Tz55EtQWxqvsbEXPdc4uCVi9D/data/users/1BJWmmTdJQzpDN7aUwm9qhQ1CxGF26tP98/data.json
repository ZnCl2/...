That doesn't say much for the battling, though. Plus, they have \"certification tests\" your \"students\" must pass before they can become a class, but one thing that really pisses me off is that you need to be skilled in a specific doctrine to pass the test just to ride a horse or a pegasus or a wyvern. You cannot, for example, be a male and have a pegasus. You just can't until the level 30 master class where you ''can'' be a male pegasus rider, but only if you are proficient in flying, lance, and sword. You can't be a bow-wielding or magic-casting flyer. Period. You can't even fucking use magic when on a flying mount, it doesn't give you the option. Was very disappointed with that.",

			"body": "Short answer? Valve had the funny idea of making lootboxes (the very first if I'm not mistaken) and they milked the fuck out of the idea and almost every other predatory business practice in the book, not to mention P2W shit at one point. Then they came upon the reasonable conclusion that they'd make more money if they made the game free - which they did, and it opened the floodgates, quite literally. All manner of shitskin, retard, child, and every other subhuman into the game, diluting the existing fanbase into a wave of shit. This only worsened with the Meet your Match update which may well have just removed community servers from the game - this means that the creation and sustenance of tight-knit sub-communities of the game could not exist, since the only 'community' these newfags would ever have with the new matchmaking are 29 other random people they have little to no contact with socially and will likely never see again once the round/game is over. \n\nIronically, you get more of a community sense from trade servers of all things. But yeah, tl;dr is that Valve went for money rather than substance and TF2 just had to be their guinea pig for testing the waters of how many shitty business practices will a community of paypigs and retards take (the answer: a lot)",

I'll start with the fact that child porn only applies to REAL children, whereas a doujin is entirely hand-drawn, and thus not child porn, as it accomplished none of the things that child porn does except for getting someone erect. \nSecondly, a 1000yo vampire (a lolibaba) wouldn't talk like or behave like a real child - that is true for most loli's out there but doesn't apply to all of them. They'd also probably look nothing like a real life child unless it's a specific artist who excels in realism - think the UnterAlterBach artist. \n\nSo this all draws back to how I said that loli is a body type, not an age.",

You could argue that the innovations stopped earlier, like following the end of the second World War, but I'm working under the assumption that the Moon landing was real. Speaking of, ask yourself why we were able to put a man on the moon about 50 years ago but nowadays we have trouble even getting an unmanned spacecraft into orbit, let alone the moon. \n\nAlso keep in mind how the more technology 'progresses', the more things stay the same. Smart phones, for instance, are becoming way too similar. They're doing the opposite of forking, and are instead 'merging' into one gadget. What's the next innovation? Uhh, a new camera lens! What about for game consoles? Well, we're making it stream stuff better (not really)! \n\nRemember that Steve Jobs interview? I'd be surprised if you haven't seen it already. He was right. Sure, he said that when Apple was much smaller than what it is today, and the problem he was describing, one could argue, is something only the big corporations experience and not the smaller fish fighting over scraps. Keep in mind, however, that the majority of the money flow for each industry goes to those big corporations, and they more often than not set the standard. A real innovator and entrepreneur could make it to the top and create serious waves, but I haven't seen or heard of any such major breakthroughs. \n\nReally, think back into recent years and tell me what \"good\" has been developed in recent years that has made a major impact and ended up being financially successful? Virtual Reality? That can't be said to have even lifted off yet, and to say it's been a financial success is a stretch. I'd even say we're going backwards with Virtual Reality rather than forwards. \n\nAlso, regarding your reply to 4383's thoughts on GUI's and shit - I think you got the wrong idea. Suffice it to say that there's a big difference between making things more convenient to save the user's time and blatantly obscuring settings/files/etc preventing you from making changes to your hardware. Proprietary software, basically. You have to install iTunes and go through a ton of elaborate steps just to make a custom ringtone on your iPhone these days. You can see what he's talking about if you work with Windows 10 and Windows 7 computers as well.",

Haven't you noticed from lurking /v/ for so long that posters think in a much different way than your run-of-the-mill normalfags (keep in mind how the term normalfag came to be, as well)? The big meme, of course, is that /v/ is pessimistic as hell and hates vidya, but in reality, I haven't seen any community more passionate about video games. Passion isn't something to be ashamed of, either, as much as normalfags want to shame you and I for liking something and wishing it the best,  especially something as \"\"\"\"nerdy\"\"\"\" as PC gaming. Because /v/-goers are so passionate, they are far more keen to decline than most others who lack such passion and eat whatever shit is put on their plates. \n\nAnyways, my point is that it's no coincidence that you and I are being shoved out of our hobby and kept away from discussion of it. Face it, we're dangerous. Make of that as you will.",
