Individual users can obviously work around that if they want to see usernames, but the general user isn't going to want to do so (and probably isn't going to have the tech knowhow to do it anyway).",

I'm saying the site itself should hide it automatically. That way anyone who wants to see them can, and everyone else is automatically set not to see them.\n\nLike the other guy said I would prefer no one be able to see them anyway, but having the default option be for them to be hidden would be nearly as good.",

That's the case with Planescape: Torment, either KotOR game, and Mask of the Betrayer. The way I've always seen it is that the combat systems in these games are designed to be akin to puzzles. You either enjoy puzzles or you don't, but even if you enjoy them I think most people would be unlikely to say that they're \"fun.\" And I say this as someone who by and large loves the CRPG genre.\n\nUnderrail got a ton of praise at 8chan.
