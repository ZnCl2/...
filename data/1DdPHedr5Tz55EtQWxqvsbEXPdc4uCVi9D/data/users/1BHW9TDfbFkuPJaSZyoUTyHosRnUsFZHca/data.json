Haldane’s rule is “when in the offspring of two different animal races one sex is absent, rare, or sterile, that sex is the heterogametic [XY] sex.”\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/haldane-s-rule-the-heterogametic-sex-1144\n\nIndeed, although Black-White mixes are not sterile and males are not absent, males (the heterogametic sex) are more rare than females.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://www.jstor.org/pss/1537084\n\nThe argument regarding Haldane’s rule is also meaningless because different species in the animal kingdom can breed and still produce fertile offspring.

Different races have developed certain proteins, or markers, that are part of the body's natural defenses. These markers help the immune system determine which cells are foreign and should be rejected.\n\nAre cells racist?\nA match between two people who share more genetically in common significantly reduces the risk of the donor and recipient cells attacking each other. (READ: cells from people of two different races will attack and fight each other as though they are a virus)\n\nThe more people of different backgrounds who produce offspring = the more types that are harder to match.\nMultiracial patients have uncommon profiles and since there can be many possible racial and ethnic combinations in multiracial societies, finding a match can still be extremely difficult.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://m.phys.org/_news162659550.html\n\nAs an example, a White mother of mixed-race child would have more genetically in common with a random White person on the street than with her own child.\nIf such a dramatic and fundamental alienation from your own parents if not horrific enough, With a mixed-race child diagnosed with leukaemia, every member of the child's own family becomes an incompatible donor for a bone-marrow transplant, and finding a compatible donor is unlikely:\n\nOne obstacle to finding a matching donor was her mixed ethnic background. Her father is black, with West Indian and Panamanian roots. Her mother is white, with Russian-Jewish roots. In addition, only 5 percent of registered donors are black.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/18/sports/baseball-rod-carew-s-daughter-dies.html\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n>Bone Marrow Transplants: When Race Is an Issue\n\n''Compared to organ transplants, bone marrow donations need to be even more genetically similar to their recipients. Since all the immune system's cells come from bone marrow, a transplant essentially introduces a new immune system to a person. Without genetic similarity between the donor and the patient, the new white blood cells will attack the host body.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1993074,00.html\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n>Race matters when a patient needs a stem cell or marrow transplant\n\nIf you become ill with a blood cancer or other disease that requires a stem cell transplant, here's an uncomfortable fact: Your race matters. Diversity is a strength in much of life, [citation needed!] but it's a curse when finding a stem cell donor match.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-05/national/41085742_1_stem-jeffrey-chell-ancestors\n\nThe Race for Ancestral Genetics in Clinical Trials\nA seasoned cancer researcher would never set up a study in which all the ill patients were, say, Canadian, and all the healthy controls were Japanese. And yet cancer researchers risk making a similar mistake if they overlook genetic information that fleshes out what many of us like to think of as race or ethnicity, some experts say.\n\nFortunately, awareness of how ancestral genetics might contribute to risk of disease and drug response in people has risen over the last several years. Studies that look directly at the problem are on the rapid rise, and this increased interest has biotechnology companies lowering the cost of tests that determine genetic ancestry, thanks to a little competition. However, experts have yet to decide on how to genetically define ancestry, suggesting examining anywhere from a handful to hundreds of gene variants.\n\nNot including information on the race or ethnicity of study volunteers could skew disease risks as stronger or weaker than they really are.",

A variant of the gene ApoE4 is a strong genetic risk factor for early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and the characteristic most likely to raise or lower that risk is race.\n\n\"It occurs in about 20% of the African American population, and it means nothing. It occurs in about 6% of the Japanese, and it makes their risk six times higher [than that for white people],\" Burchard said. \"Something about being Japanese unleashes the wrath of the gene, and something about being African American attenuates it.\"\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/18/1270.full\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n>BiDil\n\nThe FDA have approved a heart failure drug called Bidil, but only for blacks, as blacks do not benefit from conventional heart failure drugs.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116096445875393515.html?mg=com-wsj\n\nSickle-Cell Disease\nSickle cell anaemia is a condition found almost exclusively in blacks, about 1 in 4 west Africans carry the gene for it, almost no whites do. Any whites who carry the gene most likely have a black ancestor.\n\nAs a result of population growth in African-Caribbean regions of overseas France and immigration from North and sub-Saharan Africa to mainland France, sickle cell disease has become a major health problem in France.

These phenomena can be especially problematic for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones. Increased use of molecular techniques focuses attention on the extent of this underappreciated problem that is not always apparent from morphological observations alone. Some degree of gene flow is a normal, evolutionarily constructive process, and all constellations of genes and genotypes cannot be preserved.

All were Zionists (Israeli partisans). They wrote about the need for a “catalytic event” to mobilize the American people. Eight months after coming into office, they got their catalytic event on 9/11, followed by the wars their agenda required. The company providing 24/7 electronic & personal security to the WTC, Kroll Associates, was owned & operated by Zionists, as was the WTC itself as of July 2001. The owners and their immediate relatives seem to have been uncharacteristically absent on the morning of 9/11. Hundreds of American Jews died at the WTC & the Pentagon, but as best as can be determined, only 3 Israelis out of some 4,000 normally there, plus 2 more on the planes.\nThe senior fatality among WTC personnel was a retired Irish-American FBI agent in his first days on his job as Director of Security.\nA private Israeli-owned security company called ICTS registered in the Netherlands, provided security services (sometimes through a wholly owned subsidiary) to all three airports from which the four hijacked planes departed. ICTS also provided security at the airports in Paris & Amsterdam, from which the so-called “shoe” & “underwear” bombers respectively departed.\nBergen, NJ residents saw five people on a white van filming the attacks and visibly celebrating. They had set up their cameras before the first plane hit. Police arrested them. All were Israelis. Bomb-sniffing dogs reacted as if they had detected explosives, although officers were unable to find anything. The FBI seized the van for further testing. All 5 were later released at the instigation of Israeli & American Jewish leaders, some in the US Government. Details are still classified.\n\nIn a September 2001 column in The Observer about the September 11 attacks in the United States, Richard Ingrams noted “the reluctance throughout the media to contemplate the Israeli factor” and, commenting on Britain, cited “pressure from the Israeli lobby in this country that many, even normally outspoken journalists, are reluctant even to refer to such matters.”\n[https://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_Kingdom#Journalists](https://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_Kingdom#Journalists)\n\nSeptember 11 attacks advance-knowledge conspiracy theories; Israel\n[https://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theories#Israel](https://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theories#Israel)\n\nJohn P.

Mukasey ruled that Lindauer was unfit to stand trial and could not be forced to take antipsychotic medication to make her competent to stand trial. He noted that the severity of Lindauer's mental illness, which he described as a \"lengthy delusional history\", weakened the prosecution's case. In his decision he wrote, \"Lindauer ... could not act successfully as an agent of the Iraqi government without in some way influencing normal people .... There is no indication that Lindauer ever came close to influencing anyone, or could have. The indictment charges only what it describes as an unsuccessful attempt to influence an unnamed government official, and the record shows that even lay people recognize that she is seriously disturbed.”\n\nSusan Lindauer is an interesting character; she was one of the first individuals detained over the Patriot Act.

A panel truck with a painting of a plane flying into the World Trade Center was stopped near the temporary command post. It proved to be rented to a group of ethnic Middle Eastern people who did not speak English. Fearing that it might be a truck bomb, the NYPD immediately evacuated the area, called out the bomb squad, and detained the occupants until a thorough search was made. The vehicle was found to be an innocent delivery truck.”\n\n'Middle Eastern' is code word for Israeli here. One Dominik Suter, an Israeli national, was the owner of 'Urban Moving Systems Incorporated', the name of the company on the van.\n\nFurther research shows 'Urban Moving Systems Inc.', a small moving company received $665,000 in 'federal aid' in 2001, a ridiculous amount of money for a small privately owned business:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/https://20080808181459/https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.fedspending.org/faads/faads.php?reptype=r&database=faads&record_id=2039277&detail=3&datype=T&sortby=i](https://web.archive.org/web/https://20080808181459/https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.fedspending.org/faads/faads.php?reptype=r&database=faads&record_id=2039277&detail=3&datype=T&sortby=i)\n(archive.org link as the original record has now been stripped from the site database!)\n\n“The arresting officers said they saw a lot that aroused their suspicion about the men. One of the passengers had $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock. Another was carrying two foreign passports. A box cutter was found in the van. But perhaps the biggest surprise for the officers came when the five men identified themselves as Israeli citizens…\n\nThe driver of the van, Sivan Kurzberg, told the officers, \"We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are the problem.\" The other passengers were his brother Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellner and Omer Marmari.”\n\nHere's an actual police scanner recording from the incident:\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huf2Kz7bV2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Huf2Kz7bV2k)\n\"... It's a big truck with a mural painted of a... of an airplane diving into New York City and exploding.\"\n\n\"We got both suspects under Kay, we have the suspects who drive...drove in the van, THE VAN EXPLODED -- we have both of them under Kay let's get some help over here...\"\n\nOne of the most in depth videos I've seen on 9/11 that explains the reasoning behind why an attack needs to take place, and goes on to explain the many inconsistencies and outright lies within the official story is 9/11: The New Pearl Harbour:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2WFZ1G2QR4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2WFZ1G2QR4)\n\nIt's five hours long but hard to stop watching it once you start. Very well researched with sources cited for EVERYTHING. It also does a great job of debunking the debunkers.

The only way we can accomplish that, the only we can achieve a Final Solution to racial prejudice, is to create a clan of races so universal that no one can preen himself on his racial 'purity' or practice the barbarism to safeguard it. The deliberate encouragement of interracial marriages is the only way to hasten this process. And it may be that time is growing short. The dominance of our world has begun to shift, like cargo in a listing vessel, from the White races to the colored. The sooner we adjust to this fact, the better it will be for our children. For we might well acknowledge, even the most enlightened of us, that we will never completely eliminate racial prejudice until we eliminate separate races.\" \nRabbi Abraham L.

Chemical Bank, National City Bank, First National Bank, JP Morgan & Co., Guaranty Trust, New York Insurance Co., and others were the primary shareholders following the private auction of Federal Reserve shares.\nThe Morgan Crew were tight with London Bankers as JP Morgan’s father was tightly associated with George Peabody, a wealthy London banker. Mayer Rothschild paid Peabody to be a social protégé to help gain acceptance into London high society. Thus there's a chain of relations from Mayer Rothschild to JP Morgan's father Junius. London / New York Connection. Also known as the Anglo-American Alliance used to drag the USA into WWI (protip: JP Morgan was awarded monopoly underwriting of French and British treasury notes for the first years of the war!).\nThe Rockefeller Crew was tight with the Kuhn-Loeb Banking House, The Warburg’s, The Schiff’s, and the Kahn’s; a bunch of intermarried Jewish German bankers. The German connection financed much of the railroad construction which was used to give rebates to Standard Oil. Kuhn-Loeb and Schiff men served on Standard Oil-owned railroad director boards. Tight knit relationship between the Chicago and Germany establishment (Rockefeller is a German name). Rockefellers did not want to enter the war but were weaker politically at this point than Morgan’s.\nDuring the New Deal, much of the Morgan financial/Railroad Empire crumbled and was subsumed into the Rockefeller financial/Railroad Empire. Rockefellers gained yet cooperated with Morgan’s, indicating that they have maintained ties with the English establishment. Today the Fed belongs almost entirely to the Rockefeller financial establishment.\n\nArthur Levitt\n[https://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Levitt](https://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Levitt)\nInteresting profile, including;\nLevitt oversaw an audit published in August 2006, by Kroll Inc. -- where he is a consultant—describing how the City of San Diego had allowed a pension deficit of $1.43 billion.
