There is several solutions :\n- propose to not store private keys on disk (require to paste it every time you need it)\n- stored all private data in an encrypted db (require to unlock this db on start or web login)\n- incite user to install ZeroNet on an encrypted filesystem (a simpler solution but could be acceptable)\n",
