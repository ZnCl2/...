Such as harassment prevention.\n\nWe have to understand that while the environment may allow for censorship free development, a 'popular / creditable' platform will establish some level of censorship to be deemed acceptable by it's users.\n\nNo one I know would proudly be a patron of a platform where CPorn is available. And while the Trolls, and spammers have every right to create their own blog/forum of Spammers-R-Us' in a censorship free environment. It will be the administrators and moderators choice on what is deemed acceptable or to host the forum as a complete censorship free area.\n\nBut for anything that wishes to be popular and acceptable by the masses, it will enforce some level of censorship on it's users. Take The Pirate Bay for example, while they don't remove any torrents due to DMCA, they won't allow CP or other things deemed inappropriate by society.\n\nAnd i don't want my terminology to be confused, a platform would be ZeroTalk or ZeroBlog, while the environment is Zeronet.\nIf someone doesn't like warporn, don't visit warporn sites. But it's unfair to create an environment where warporn can't exist. That's bad and only opens a pandora's box.\n\n",
