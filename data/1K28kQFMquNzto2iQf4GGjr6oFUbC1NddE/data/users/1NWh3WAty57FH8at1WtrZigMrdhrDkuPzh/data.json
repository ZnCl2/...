Or rather, am/am not. Someone might avoid programming because \"I'm not good with computers.\" Nonsense. You're not good with computers because you didn't bother to learn or practice. Not that you simply aren't cut out for it.\n\nLikewise, identity talk like that can lead to people *not wanting* to branch out. And feel some sort of weird forcing of having to do or make certain things. \"I'm a gamer, so I have to keep playing games.\"\n\nI find that when you eliminate this way of thinking, you start to branch off and look into a bunch of cool stuff. So forget whether your are or aren't something. Whether you aspire to be a particular thing. Just do what you like, do what you think looks cool. Even if you think that's not you.

I'm pretty sure most people agree that underage minors unable to make decisions and enter legal contracts should not be exploited. AFAIK no one has an issue with stuff like loli hentai. This view also breaks down once you divorce duration of life from physical and mental age.\n\n> censorship of speech is good (insults and things like that) \n\nThis is probably the worst use of censorship. Insults will always exist, even if you ban using the words. New words will simply pop up in their place. On top of that, insults aren't problematic in the slightest.\n\n> Some opinions are deemed bad by a government or a company\n\nThis. If you have the ability to censor content, you have an authority that has the *power* to censor content. Meaning that there's an imbalance of free speech. One agent (the government/company/etc) has more power over the other. This is bad. And can lead to thought policing of even good ideas (such as avoiding censorship :P). One should not be punished for bringing up new ideas. Look at any religion to see how that turns out.\n\n>On the other hand, trolls abuse the right to freely speak your mind, they will try to destroy a community.\n\nIf a community is destroyed by allowing people to freely speak, it must not have been a good community to begin with. There *is* something to be said about spam drowning out legitimate content and speech. But that's essentially censorship through volume, rather than removing the offending content.\n\n>I hope these new decentralized networks like ZeroNet will let us try and find out to see if the current model of censoring speech is good or if there is something that is much better for society.\n\nDecentralized networks and communities allow people to speak uncensored. Those who wish to artificially limit what they hear or say can do so. Those who want completely free speech regardless of hate/spam/etc can also do so.",
