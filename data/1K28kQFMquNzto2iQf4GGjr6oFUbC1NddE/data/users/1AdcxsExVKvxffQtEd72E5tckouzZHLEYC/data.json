			"body": "ZN should remain with Tor. Why:\n1.Python with Java ? That cannot go well. :)\n2.ZN client will be to heavy with integrated Java I2P with all the problems what Java has. If an extra I2P install is required not many will install it just for ZN.\n3.I am aware that theoretically I2P is slightly more anonymous(supposing the same userbase level) however it is less tested then Tor because it has less userbase. And with the less userbase an I2P user is more  receptive to a profiling attack - so finally less anonymous.\n4. Basically I am not against I2P, it is a good project but shouldn't be a top priority it's implementation on ZN. If somebody is still eager to implement it I wouldn't stop him - but should be an optout for those who don't want a heavier client.\n5. Should any time in the future I2P have less heavy client or more userbase or ZN change to Java than the above points could be reconsidered.",
