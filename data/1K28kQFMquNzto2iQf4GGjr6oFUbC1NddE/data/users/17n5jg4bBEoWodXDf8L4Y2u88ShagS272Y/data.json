			"body": "@ekaterina: I can agree with that, and the other problem with rating is there is no sacrifice in it, you're not giving up one thing for another. But ordering/ranking by preference on the other hand does include sacrifice, and people do tend to order by preference in many things. Like if you ask someone to pick up something from the store for you, you might say \"get me X, and if they don't have it get me Y\". But also if you had a list of uses for something like water for example, that list might be: gardening, drinking, bathing, cleaning clothes, etc, so if you had a limited supply of water you could easily rank the importance of each of those things. You might also say rank presidents by which one you want to win the most to the least.",

And if I am unfairly deleting posts, well then start a forum that competes and stake a reputation on being fair.\n\nThis is identical to Walter Blocks view on immigration: http://www.watchmybit.com/Video/Show/c74b8597-e9d9-4562-98d2-b0a1bc8beec8\n\nThat basically if you don't want 'open' borders and immigrants using welfare then privatize everything, otherwise it is your fault for not privatizing everything.\n",

It's very likely they utilize copyrights and patents and NDAs and non-compete agreements, as well as receive some revenue by government agencies that want to spy on people, which at that point makes them indirectly a public entity that should be respecting free speech. It's also very likely that governments ask them to censor as well!!!\n",

			"body": "@ekaterina: The point I am making though is, as you stated most people don't care how badly they are treated, and if they don't care they will also not vote in a democracy to prevent those kinds of things, and even if a majority did actually care and would vote, that majority could also much more easily leave into a competing network and bring their friends with them. But people don't care and at least in the United States, congress has taken several shits on individual privacy for over a decade, and the majority keeps electing them, never mind whether some partially private social network does the same.\n\nI personally have a Facebook account but I rarely post on there and I look at friends posts occasionally, mostly to see if they had kids or how their family is doing, but a lot of their posts I would label as spam simply because they are promoting political garbage, even my brother at one time trolled his Facebook friends by essentially saying he doesn't give a fuck about their political views.\n\nAnd that is another problem with these 'friend networks' is that you don't want to piss off your friends, I have a lot of both liberal and conservative friends that I can't say something that won't offend at least one person. So even if I wanted to promote something I believe in, I am not worried about Facebook censorship as much as pissing off friends or indirectly exposing things about my personal life to coworkers who have differing world views. I also used to like saying dumb stuff to see how people respond and learn from that. That is why I post a lot on reddit and now ZeroNet, there is some freedom with some anonymity that you don't get in the likes of Facebook.\n",
