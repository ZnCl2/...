One way to make that impossible is to add a hash to votes based on the question and answer and then check the hash of every vote before displaying it. If the hash isn't right, the vote will be ignored, so tampering with one of your polls would basically create a completely new poll while deleting the old one which means tampering with polls in data.json becomes useless. That is one of the features I do plan to add if it doesn't make things unusably slow, but I need to add infinite scrolling first, otherwise this has to be done for all votes on all polls ever created every time someone votes on something and we're already at 93 polls and 3002 votes :)\n\nIf it does turn out to be too slow, I'll have to add some more optimizations first. Right now when a new vote comes in on any poll, all polls that are displayed get updated because I have no idea which poll changed, since ZeroNet doesn't send updates right now you just load the whole data again. I could however find out what changed manually with deep object diffs, and then only a single poll would have to be updated, I wanted to do that anyhow because it already takes way too long and makes Firefox freeze for half a second when a vote comes in. If that doesn't turn out to be too slow as well for other reasons, otherwise I'd have to wait for ZeroNet to implement the update mechanism which is the highest priority for ZeroNet right now, although I'm not sure if that actually will give app developers information about what changed specifically through the API or if it is just used to save bandwidth.",

That's just how people generally are. It's also why you rarely hear \"I disagree with person X about Y\" and instead much more often hear \"Person X is an idiot!\".

Most people do agree that underage porn for example should be censored. However, when it comes to speech, a no censorship at all approach becomes viable.\n\nI moved from thinking some censorship of speech is good (insults and things like that) to all censorship is bad, but that is probably a minority opinion, feel free to disagree, maybe in 5 years I change my mind yet again. Censoring rude/offensive speech sounds good at first, you want your community to be nice and welcoming, but when you do that, you exclude people who have a mental illness that makes then unable to be polite at all times, you exclude people who have a terrible life and sometimes get rude because of it, or people who generally have a good life but something terrible happened, a death of a family member maybe. By trying to make a community more welcoming you end up excluding a lot of people because it's easier to be intolerant, not because it's right.\n\nAnd the power to censor is also way too often abused to censor different opinions. Some opinions are deemed bad by a government or a company (social media) and then nobody is allowed to say if they agree or disagree, nobody is allowed to discuss it, so nothing will ever change for the better, and that can be really bad. Let's say you are gay but you live in a country where being homosexual is illegal. Censorship of something so basic as speech can really hinder social progress here. You won't be able to find any support, any understanding, when talking about your very life is forbidden.\n\nAnd if some people have bad ideas, and these bad ideas are censored, there is never a chance to make them change their mind by having an open and reasonable discussion, so they will have these bad ideas forever and might end up doing something much worse than merely saying a bad thing. It's trying to solve problems by ignoring them, by hiding them, because dealing with problems takes too much effort.\n\nOn the other hand, trolls abuse the right to freely speak your mind, they will try to destroy a community. The question is, what is worse? Allowing the troll to speak, or forbidding the homosexual to speak? To me, the latter is much worse, it's a real issue whereas the former is merely an annoyance, so I can't support any censorship of speech, knowing that if I did, good speech would get the ban hammer as well. But maybe communities just don't work without censorship, maybe there would be too many trolls, droning out the real conversations. I hope these new decentralized networks like ZeroNet will let us try and find out to see if the current model of censoring speech is good or if there is something that is much better for society.",

By only allowing one ZeroID, you can have a site like ZeroPolls where you can only vote once, you can't (without a lot of effort) make an infinite amount of accounts to seriously rig the vote. So the idea of having multiple ID providers (like ZeroID and ZeroVerse) instead of one provider with an unlimited number of accounts can be a good thing. The best solution would probably be to have different models for different providers. So one ID provider might allow you to create as many identities as you want, another might only allow one so it can be used for sites like ZeroPolls.",

That's how polls work on the clearnet as well, it's fairly easy to make one account on a website (that is usually tied to an email address so you have to make a throwaway email as well), but making a 1000 is something else entirely, can be done of course but who is going to do that when there is no money to be gained. The real issue would be tools that automate that process and make it one click.

And if I am unfairly deleting posts, well then start a forum that competes and stake a reputation on being fair.\n\n@bukaking: I thought so too but I don't anymore. \"If you don't agree with Facebook censorship, use something different. If you don't agree with Twitter censorship, use something different\" The problem with that is, at that point you are disconnected from the rest of the world. Basically everyone uses Facebook. If you don't, then you are an outcast, you are no longer part of (online) society. This is censorship on a scale even bigger than government censorship (and therefore much worse) because these companies can censor all over the world not just in one country.\n\nAnd it's not just Facebook of course, although they are particularly bad since they work directly with governments to censor. But as far as I know all big social networks censor, so even if you don't use Facebook (I don't) and use something smaller but still popular, you run into this issue. So I believe (and maybe I am right, maybe you are right, just an opinion) we are past the point where we can allow private entities to censor speech on the internet, it should be considered a human rights violation. For small forums that would be overkill, but where does one set a limit? At what point does a forum get too big for censorship to be acceptable?\n\nBut like I said, maybe that doesn't even work, maybe a bit of censorship is necessary because otherwise everything ends in chaos. I hope to find the answer to that question using decentralized networks and I am willing to change my current opinion when being proved wrong.",

Multiple European countries have urged citizens to not use Facebook because of their shady and often illegal business practices, their privacy violations. Facebook did a horrible, illegal experiment on hundreds of thousands of Facebook users for the American Department of Defense, trying to see if they could psychologically manipulate people on a grand scale as a form of crowd control, by preventing them from seeing happy posts from their friends to make them depressed. The majority of people did not leave Facebook, it is still growing.

So even if I wanted to promote something I believe in, I am not worried about Facebook censorship as much as pissing off friends or indirectly exposing things about my personal life to coworkers who have differing world views. I also used to like saying dumb stuff to see how people respond and learn from that. That is why I post a lot on reddit and now ZeroNet, there is some freedom with some anonymity that you don't get in the likes of Facebook.\n\nThat's a very interesting perspective, and it's true. That would be self-censorship, we all do that, and sometimes we shouldn't, but the danger of loosing friends or even family members because of our opinions is real and frightening enough to make us do it anyhow, instead of standing up for the things we believe in. Even when it's strangers we strife to be accepted and liked. I even do that self-censorship here on ZeroNet to be honest, while yes I am anonymous, I also created a bunch of sites that are all tied to this one username, this username has a reputation that I could damage and that would affect the sites I am working on. I don't have many controversial opinions, and I do believe every single one of them is moral, but the problem is in reality every opinion is controversial, with billions of people on the internet there is not a single statement you could make that someone would not take offense with. If I said the Earth is round, there would be a few hundred (or thousand?) flat earthers who think I am completely nuts. Although in that case I don't care, they are nuts! :P",
