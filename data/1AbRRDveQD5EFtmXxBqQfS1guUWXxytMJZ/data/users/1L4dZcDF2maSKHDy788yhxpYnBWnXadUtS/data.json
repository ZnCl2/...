The ZeroTorrent site on [ZeroHello](/) shows any failed/unpublished files related to your profile on that site? (some sites shows a bell kind of icon on ZeroHello sites list), details of failed files is shown inside ZeroTorrent site (0) menu on the bottom of the menu). In my case i do not see any update failed files. This do not seem like global problem of the ZeroTorrent, because i can see [other user submission](/192dZ1EG5tU7PnCfuwGMDEBrr2eLqvs4t3/?Topic:2_1J5uFzQBpLpoyTZfH28Fv8KrThShewrF2d/Blockchain+gouvernance+et+nergie+Thinkerview) without problem.. Another thing you can try is to Rebuild and reload site database? (it is also done from within mentioned site (0) menu).\nIt would be ideal if there is some way to discover why this happended so it can be prevented for other users in future.",
