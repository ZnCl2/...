			"body": "@Klu9:\n\n> Although Caryoscelus does offer clearnet Atom and RSS feeds, the \"Subscribe: 0net\" button is a void Javascript that just gives me a \"Cannot load error\".\n\nThanks for reporting. I wonder when did it start complaining like that. I'm pretty sure it still works, though (you can check in js console that it does send request to 0net server)\n\n> void Javascript\n\nThe href content isn't what makes it work, it's the onclick attribute ;) It's just there to be ignored, but i somehow made it unignorable\n\n\n**update**: now it should work with a fancy success message instead of error one",

When you click that link, various new messages appear ;)\n\n> I got a blue 0net \"Subscribed to...\" message\n\n\"Subscribed to post feed\". I did not implement comment feed (yet). But as i said, that's just message, otherwise it should've worked fine the first time\n\n> But when I try to open it in a new tab, I get a \"Not found\" error.\n\nYeah, that's kinda \"expected\". The problem is that i'm using onclick instead of proper href for all links. The whole engine is one big mess. Eventually it should be replaced with something sane",

Jekyll is fine, except that loading pages is relatively slow in 0net, it has no integration with feeds and it's a waste of space (although who cares about few hundred extra kilobytes when we're wasting mega and even gigabytes, lol)",
